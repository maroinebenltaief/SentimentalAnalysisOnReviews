"I'm a local author and this store has been here for pretty much all of my personal and professional print needs for the last few years now. While I've never closely compared prices between stores/businesses, the times I have checked the prices have been comparable, while I feel I get a better level of service from the knowledgeable and friendly staff, as well as a better quality product, when I have signs, photos, and business cards made here. I've never had any negative experiences - keep up the great work!"
I would like to thank Khalid Mankal for all of his time and effort in providing the best service ever.  So caring and understanding with three fragile shipments that were taken care of.  I would use UPS store #25  managed by Khalid Mankal any time.  So efficient .  There are not enough words to express my appreciation and gratitude.  P. Maxwell.
"Went to have a CD label printed on special paper. Waited 30 minutes, there were two employees working, one who was busy with another customer and another who asked us to wait for the first employee to finish up before he could help us. Did not think it would be such a complicated process as the files were already prepared, and we supplied the paper."
"I use this location all the time, both personal and business, and I couldn't ask for better service. I've had multiple rush situations, and they have pulled through every time.Keep up the excellent work guys."
"On 15 October 2019 @18:20 I went to this store to drop off a cable modem to Rogers.Shipping payed by Rogers.Label on the box, ready to go.The east indian man in his early 40s who was working there,wearing glasses told me to ""Just leave it on the counter,I will take care of it.Rogers never received the package.The worker never scanned the shipping label.Make sure they scan your shipping label before you leave this store.I will not be going in there again.I hate thieves."
From the moment I walked into the store the staff were unfriendly and not interested in helping me ship my prepaid package.Save yourself the frustration and head to another location or use another shipping provider.
amazing service!had my business cards printed within 5 hrs .highly recommend.
"I give the package,they charged me,they delivered it,what else is there to say about a ups store."
"Just received 5 star, professional, polite and courteous service. I stepped in to drop off a package and they were very busy. Just one employee taking care of the wholeShop but he managed to do it efficiently and was polite to each and every customer in the store. I haven’t had this kind of experience at other similar shops, it was a pleasant surprise and this will be my go-to UPS store moving forward."
"Have a UPS return label on my phone, they charged me $1.47 to print the label out to stick it on the box claiming it’s their paper and their ink. Apparently the UPS Store has no way to scan the UPS return label and I had to send the label to an UPS email address and pay to print it out as a print job. This is after waiting around for 10 minutes while this guy works on printing for another customer, without even an eye contact acknowledging that me and 2 other groups of people are waiting."
"For the past 2 years, I have frequented this specific location (and only this location) due to the excellent service I receive each visit! Each visit I deal with a customer service representative named Kaitlyn and she is a spectacular human being who gives 150% each visit! She is precise, effective, emphasis on precise. It can be tricky sending packages to other countries and on a few occasions I've run into difficulties. She resolved the issues quickly and efficiently. Everyone in the store is kind and helpful but she truly is my favourite. This UPS location is truly a gem!"
"While visiting Ottawa for Christmas, my wife received a lovely shadow-box type framed dress. The dress was over 100-years old and was originally her great-grandmother's wedding dress. We were concerned how best to ship it back home. The staff at this UPS store were able to secure the glass in the frame and pack the whole piece up safely. We were able to ship the package out to the west coast and it arrived without any issues. I was amazed the glass had not broken.These people know what they are doing when it comes to packaging priceless materials.Thanks again."
"These people don't want to do their job. I'm writing this on May 25th 2020. I brought in a package (pre-labeled) and they told me that they weren't accepting people bringing in packages; I would have to call and schedule a UPS truck to come get it. OK sure, I call the number and it won't even ring - they're so flooded with calls their machine literally is rejecting any calls. I need my package shipped out, ASAP. So, I think to myself, maybe another UPS store will accept my package, but before going I call ahead this time.I called 3 UPS stores in Ottawa, and guess what they all said to me, THEY WOULD LOVE TO TAKE MY PACKAGE. Literally this store is the only one in Ottawa that refused. When UPS's customer service line opens up for calls guess who's making a formal complaint :)"
Wish I could remove the star! This store would not take my package as it was too long yet another UPSStore (#112) took it right away... And please do not say it is too big; your reference in going to your satellite on Steeverage is dumb as they dispose of even less space than your store.  Not the first time I have issues with this supposed UPS Store . 👎👎👎👎👎
"Dropped into the store to drop off a package for shipment and asked for a piece of tape to close the box, the manager of the store, Param Naidu would not put a piece of packing tape on the box unless I paid for him to pack it nor would he give me a piece of tape so I could close the box before it was shipped.  Apparently Param is upset that UPS doesn't pay for the all of tape he is using so he is making customers buy full rolls.  Having used the UPS Store since the days of the Mailboxes Etc. and I have never been asked to buy a full roll of tape."
"Had to go to this store on two occasions because of UPSnot delivering to my home while I was at home all day.  The purpose of a courier is to get it from point A to point B.  Not me having to go pick it up.  The ratings by customers are from one end of the spectrum to the other.  Some find it great, others find it lacking.  I can only speak for my own experience - both visitsto the store were extremely SLOW.  I would choose an alternate source of service."
Paid for a service to hold mail but when we decided not to renew the service they refused to give us our mail until we would.To the replier: Please give me an e-mail or any way I can contact you and I can assure you this did happen and we got no calls except the one saying you were holding our mail until we payed.
"Well not impressed what so ever, I got past the front door and could barely walk in, there were so many boxes on the floor it was a trip hazards for sure, only enough room for 1 person at the counter but had to watch where I was walking, and as for going to the store computer well I don't know how I could even get there due to the huge amount of stuff on the floor  even the counter was cluttered.Not impressed with a storethat is corporate"
better off going to canada post at shoppers across the street...mask exemption only available to the owner who was clearly within a couple of feet of employees while barefaced....he chased me out the door and was 2 feet away threatening the police and banning me....if you are going to go there be extremely careful and disinfect anything you take out of there...saw them handling parcels without sanitizing between so if infected it's possibly passed on to you.. I had emailed 2 pages for printing and Dave would not even give curb service to mask exempt...why? thinking because I ask him why he wasn't wearing a mask himself...I am mask exempt and advised as such
"Like someone has mentioned before in the reviews, they are not so fast to make copies, they need some practice and give their employees red bull once in a while. I had to wait in line for a while, it took the guy 15 min for 2 dual side prints for the little lady at the counter, I almost wanted to ask him if I could do it for him. Then it took him 10 minutes to find my package in the back. Be sure to bring a pillow if you go there."
"Customer service a zero, they told me over the phone to show up for a package without i.d, I show up the Chinese man that I spoke to now is refusing to help me, says that I am racist, first of all buddy  not racist your the racist one who wouldn't help me or the person behind me, youshouldnt be allowed to use ups your all a scam do not go here"
"I'm writing this to express my deep dissatisfaction with the UPS services. I have entrusted them with the delivery of my parcel( tracking id- 1Z63XV820415027934) but unfortunately the parcel has been misplaced and while tracking the parcel it's showing it got delivered. When I contacted their customer service several times to do inquiry about the state and raising investigation about my parcel, but to no avail I'm extremely disappointed that UPS has not taken any initiative to investigate this matter which has caused me significant inconvenience and loss. I request those who are reading this please don't trust UPS, go with some other courier services. Worst experience ever"
I had a package that needed to get to the US quickly.  The owner of the shop was very helpful and went the extra mile to even drop my parcel off at the depot on his way home to make sure it made the night time pickup!The parcel made it in half of the time expected. UNREAL.I will definitely be going to UPS for all my parcel sending.  They apparently have printing and all sorts of other services I didn't realize as well.Amazing Service!
"Exceptional service.  Great staff.  This UPS store handles all my mailing needs better than anyone else I've ever experienced.  #1 by far.  Everyone at the store goes above and beyond to help me and my business be efficient.  I have a mailbox there that captures all my mail, the staff hold onto my boxes and accept deliveries, and they work with my team and hold onto sensitive packages.  They are like my second office and I trust them fully.  Amazing location, amazing service.  Highly recommended."
"Had a dreadful experience with UPS delivering my parcel yesterday January 8/16. Told it would come at end of day. Not knowing their end of day I joined UPS site and waited for a reply to my question. I was told it would come between 9:00  - 7:00 pm.I called to see if they could narrow the time down....absolutely not! In this day and age of cell phones & GPS' you can't tell me this company doesn't know where their drivers are.Since I knew I would be out of apartment at 4:00pm but still in my building I put a note on the entry code board at 1:10 telling the driver where to find me. There was also another note for UPS posted.About an hour later I noticed the UPS truck out on the street and waited at the door for my parcel. Nothing! OK, wrong truck. Shortly afterward I received an email telling me my parcel could not be delivered because I wasn't home. Down I went to the front door and sure enough both of us received the same message.""Sorry we missed you"", ""Final notice"", "" pick up next weekday"", ""scan to see where""!!! What a crock of dog poo!!1) not everyone has a computer2) no where on card saying where to p/u3) no other attempt to deliverI called the 1800#. After several requests for redelivery I said the parcel either came today or it goes back to sender... Home Depot.It was suggested I just go and pick it up. If I wanted to do that I would have gone to the  store I would have gone to Gerrard Square and made a day of it! I thought this was more convenient. Anywho, I was supposed to receive a phone call telling me if it could be redelivered. No phone call but I did receive an email telling me where I could get it today. I called the place just after 6:00pm CLOSED.However, there delivery time was 9:00 - 7:00!Interesting!Instead of going up to Toronto Street I called today, Saturday, January 9/16 and spoke to Charles a most delightful gentleman. I have him my tale of woe, he understood my sarcasm and we had a great laugh. He looked for my parcel to mark "" return to sender "". No parcel!Had I gone to the UPS store I would have been furious! We don't know where the parcel is now. Guess what? I don't give a damn where it is as long as I get my money back!The rating I gave here is for CHARLES only!For UPS I will never ever purchase anything online that uses this company! Worst ever!!"
Fast delivery to this UPS store. Doubt that an attemp was made to deliver to my home address. No doorbell ring nor notification card . This was a present I was not expecting. Would not have known of it until the sender asked me  about it upon him receiving an email confirmation of delivery. I was left clueless and could have sat at 2 Toronto St. until returned to sender.
WORST customer service ever! Talked to Ben at the store and his attitude was very rude. I dropped off my package at this location and it got lost (or maybe it was never sent out). He refused to help and told me that they have nothing to do with UPS..(what?!)DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!
"Great customer service at this location. I've had different quality of experiences at different locations, but this franchisee is fantastic. I went a few minutes before their shipping deadline (before they closed), and they did everything possible to rush and capture my shipment data as the pickup guy was waking through the door. Thank you, it was really important that my documents left on time, and you guys made it happen!"
Michelle provided impressive service which is rare these days. It's the tiny gestures that matter. She offered me water and a paper towel to seal the envelope on her own initiative as I expressed my hesitation to seal the envelope with my tongue. I was concerned the courier guy would not see or read the small print to ring the doorbell. Michelle decided to write large letters and showed me that an oversight won't occur. I phoned to request proof of signature and she emailed me the evidence without delay. Michelle showed genuine kindness and wiped all worries from my mind. I felt grateful.Thanks Michelle for your outstanding attitude.
"I used their service in Nov, 2018 and I was extremely impressed with the service they provided. The lady, Michelle, helped me pack my lose items in such a neat way that I could send my parcel with a smaller box which cost me much less if I had to pack myself. I’ve used ups and dhl services quite a lot in different countries but this store is much more cheerful and helpful. It’s lucky that I came to this place to deliver my stuff back to hk."
"BEWARE OF SCAM OPERATION: I went in yesterday (Monday) advising that I require documents to be sent International Express to Hong Kong to arrive by Thursday. This guy could tell I don't use UPS frequently and took full advantage. With a friendly smile and chatty service, he went ahead and charged me more $ than the most expensive service and sent it via the cheapest service. If it weren't for my brother, we wouldn't have been the wiser on this. But he knew the prices and cross checked again with the website. I was overcharged by $30!! The rep made sure to give me a form rather than the waybill from the envelope which would have informed me as to what the pricing should have been. Make sure you check the prices on the website before you go on or they will rip you right off!!! Unfortunately, we found out too late and the documents may not even arrive on time!!"
"My primary issue is with the location of this UPS store. There is no in and out parking. For those of us who are not walking distance from the store, it’s a hassle. Somehow recently all my UPS  packages end up there. I couldn’t be less happy about it. While the employees (Sima and Mohsen) are generally not customer service oriented and somehow seem to always be on the phone negotiating with customers, I’ve always gotten my packages handed to me, which in itself is worthy of 2 stars as some other reviewers weren’t as fortunate."
"The reputation of this store seems to speak for itself with all of these negative reviews. The store is unpleasant from entry. The owner is disorganized, rude, and almost acts like he's doing you a favour to serve you once he finally gets around to it. Any of the other employees are no better. If you can go to any other UPS store, you should. It's a shame that this is the only store at such a busy servicing area and UPS really should look into all of these negative reviews and consider taking the appropriate action. Shameful."
"When I saw the negative ratings, I was really shocked, because I use this location several times a week, and always get efficient, and polite service.  The ownership of this store switched a while ago, and is now family run - these are really good people, who are always going out of their way to give excellent service - I really am a happy customer, and am glad the owners, Mohsen and Sima, are there to help always, and are doing a very good job operating the business, since the ownership changed.  I think the bad reviews must be old, because they truly are very good people, who work long days, and always go the extra distance to help me out."
"Today I arrived at this UPS location at 9:00am on a Monday morning. After checking the hours posted on their website, on their voice messaging service, and on their storefront, I was extremely disappointed when the store did not open on time. I waited until 9:18am in a line up with other customers, and then gave up and walked over to the Belsize location, which was actually open as advertised.Unprofessional and unreliable."
Very helpful and speedy ups store . They get you and guide you very well. They are clean and always helpingI was here for shipping my laptop and monitor. Ur was about 85$ to ship heavy stuff weighing 25 lbsThey also have printing services and faxing services at a decent charge
"I have dropped off many packages in this store, the lady is helpful and kind. She usually carefully checks the packaging and provides a receipt.But today I went to dropped off an UPS package here. A male employee told me to put the package aside and then I could leave. He wasn't going to scan it and providing me a receipt. I asked him for a receipt and told him that my other package shipped three days ago that was still missing because it wasn't scanned and I didn't get a receipt to prove that I dropped it off. Now he says that if I don't have a receipt, it is none of the store's business."
"The lady at the counter is helpful. Our transaction was swift and smooth. The store is small and squishy, filled with boxes here and there, obviously because it's a freight/package/parcel delivery business. It's best to make a booking before going there IF YOU'LL BE SHIPPING PARCELS but if you're just picking up a parcel then you may just walk in. I did not waited long at all and the usual you need an identification for picking up your parcels."
"This location STOLE both my husband's iphone and macbook. They forged my signature (I saw it as proof of delivery online). I went to pick up the package, as an infocard notice was left at my door. I arrived and they said it had already been picked up. The signature was taken at their store (no one else knew about the package) while I was at work. Asked for video footage but they refused to provide it. Will NEVER use this location."
"Extremely disappointed. I went there to send a package through UPS and instead they sent my package through DHL without my consent. I realized the next day and called them, but they basically told me if I wanted my package sent though UPS I had to verbally say it, so I was confused because it says on google maps ""UPS store"". Anyways, who ever goes to this store, please make sure you double check with them which carrier they are using before paying."
"I have shipped out goods from this UPS store multiple times and each time, they'll tell me that I will receive my tracking number via email provided and every time I will never receive the tracking number. I'll call back and they'll tell me to call the general UPS phone number to track my package. This is very inconvenient for me as a shipper."
"I don’t really leave google reviews because I’m usually too lazy to.But the service I consistently receive from store 206 on Bloor street is too exceptional not to leave a review.Every-time I go in there, I’m met with a smile on the faces of the couple in the store (I’m assuming they are a couple of course.) They go above and beyond to ensure you have a great experience. We need more people like them in this world, it seem to me that they are genuine people and the way they treat other people comes natural to them. You can just tell."
"Thank you Nabila and team for your help, kindness, knowledge and generosity to get our shipment to us in Vancouver. Nabila went ABOVE & BEYOND for us and helped to make a challenging task of shipping frozen baked goods, an easy one. Even from Toronto she provided more help and assistance than the 1-800 number and of the local UPS offices in Vancouver. She gave the kindest most genuine service I’ve experienced with UPS. I wish all customer service workers were like her. She makes the world a better place. Thank you again SO much.."
Excellent customer service. They were patient enough to listen to my concerns & did all the necessary arrangements for my heavy package to reach me on time. I’ve never experienced such courteous service before. It was a refreshing new experience for me. Knowing that my important package was well taken care of and packed efficiently makes me more confident than I was before. I look forward to using their services again.
We have been to this Ups store several times and the staff has always been very helpful and accommodating. Thank you so much for your official passport photo service for our newborn. It was quite a challenge.Update: unfortunately the photos have been rejected by the passport offices. (The finger of daddy holding baby was visible). But thanks anyway for the efforts.
"Wrote the wrong date and year on our passport photos, making them useless.I discovered this just a day before I was to meet my guarantor for the passport. And this place was closed, so had to run to another place that was open and get new ones taken. Re printing wont do me any good."
"The BEST; or WONDERFUL - I can’t decide which is the better description for this team at 2100 Bloor in TO. So helpful and quick and supportive (my apologies for needing a rush job). Thank you for being awesome and so friendly in a couple of jobs well-done. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (I wanted to award 6 stars on that scale of 1-5)Arthur Orsini, visiting from Vancouver"
"The employee I just spoke to needs training and lacks common sense.I was returning a package that was addressed to the previous resident of my apartment. When I arrived, the employee was in the middle of a conversation with another customer (they couldn't find the customer's package that he had been called to pick up), but interrupted the first customer to ask me what I needed. I explained the package was meant for the previous resident and the UPS employee told me ""You need to give this to UPS."" I asked him how I should do that if not by taking it to a UPS store. He said ""Ok, I'll give it to them."" Meanwhile the first customer had gotten frustrated at being ignored and walked out. I then asked about printing costs, and in the middle of answering the question, someone else walked in and the employee interrupted his own answer to ask the next person what they needed. The employee also had trouble helping this person, and after a few minutes of waiting (with the employee literally talking past me to the person behind me) I gave up and left."
"I will never ship here again. Received a quote on paypal to ship to Belleville, ON for $40 CAD with tracking. I went to this location to ship as it is the closest location to me and the service was awful. Claimed they only offer 1 type of shipping, it was $65 CAD. He then decides to charge me $7 for a box without telling me the price until he's already asking for my card and also charged me $6.99 for a bag of packing peanuts when I never asked for packing peanuts and he used 1 handful. It's pretty obvious that the customer service at this location is subpar. Avoid this location at all costs"
I just went in with a computer that needed to go to North Bay. I told the person I believe to be the owner (even worse that it was the owner or manager) that the package needed to go to North Bay. A day later I received my computer at my house. The wrong address was put on the package. The owner/manager I spoke to didn't take any responsibility he just blamed me for the mistake telling me I gave him the wrong slip. I just gave him the whole package of materials and said it needed to go to North Bay I trusted he would know which label to put on and if there was a mistake with the materials from Lenovo at least think about what he was doing - hmmm. the customer says North Bay and I just put a label on for Toronto. It's the lack of responsibility I find the most frustrating. I won't be going back and as a result my computer will be help up for weeks as Lenovo now has to send me a whole new box. Won't be getting my lap top for awhile.
"THE WORSTAll the fake reviews are laughable.Completely incompetent, rude and downright crooked management/ownership. Zero integrity.How people like this aren't run out of business is beyond me.Avoid them unless you enjoy headaches and getting ripped off.You've been warned."
"They did not call me on delivery. Did not buzz me either when my name and buzz code were clearly displayed. They also did not fill out the time the package was attempted to be delivered, which is interesting to me also since they did not bother buzzing me or Calling. Very annoying as I’ll be working tomorrow and needed this package by today."
"The staff at this location are completely useless.The man working there just stared at me and when I gave him my ID he gave it back, said it was not the correct ID but ignored me when I asked what the correct ID was. USELESS!!!"
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting this UPS Store branch and I must say it was an outstanding experience. This store offers a wide range of shipping and mailbox services, making it a one-stop destination for all my shipping needs.The convenience of this UPS Store is unmatched. Situated in a prime location, it's easily accessible and has ample parking nearby, making it hassle-free to drop off or pick up packages. The store itself is well-maintained, clean, and organized, providing a professional atmosphere.One aspect that sets this UPS Store apart is its exceptional customer service. From the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted warmly by the knowledgeable and friendly staff. They were attentive, patient, and went above and beyond to address all my inquiries and concerns. Their expertise in shipping regulations and packaging options was evident, ensuring that my package was handled with care and delivered securely.Moreover, the range of services offered at this UPS Store is impressive. Whether you need to ship packages locally or internationally, they have various shipping options to suit your needs and budget. Additionally, their mailbox services are convenient for individuals and businesses alike. The staff is more than happy to assist in setting up a mailbox and managing incoming mail efficiently.During my visit, I found the store to be well-stocked with a variety of shipping supplies such as boxes, tape, and packing materials. This saved me the hassle of running around searching for these essentials elsewhere.Overall, my experience at the UPS Store on 451 Dundas St W was exceptional. The combination of friendly staff, convenient location, comprehensive services, and attention to detail made it a top-notch establishment for all my shipping and mailbox needs. I highly recommend this UPS Store to anyone seeking reliable, efficient, and customer-oriented shipping services in Toronto."
I just changed from the other companies to UPS. I sent my packages to my family in Europe several times at this location 451 Dundas W. For holiday seasons or any occasions. The guy there “Bernard” he is nice and very helpful. Packed all stuff for me.  I can track my packages information and activity where they are. Can see all the process.  I was there on Wednesday morning. Now my packages are already at the destination.  Take only few days. And the rate here is very reasonable. Highly recommended. Thanks again. Make everyone happy to receive the gifts from me at this pandemic.
Bernard were incredibly helpful today. They saved me a total of $800 by cutting down our box that I had to ship to China. Let alone this took up to 30 minutes out of his day and he made me feel very comfortable. he even taught me some tricks throughout the process. If you need to ship something out I would 100% recommend coming to this UPS store. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!
"I came on a weekday, in the afternoon, to mail something internationally. In the end, I wasn't able to mail my item (I was told UPS does not mail to P.O. Boxes), the man who helped me was not phased, he was just as cordial, and patient before learning I couldn't mail my item through them. He kindly directed me what to do, and where to go afterwards. Thank you, nice man!"
"What a complete mess in this store. Owner has no pride in his business. Packages l, including mine were just tossed in an unmarked box not even behind the counter! Anyone could go in there and steal your package while it's waiting to be shipped especially since the guy working there was nowhere to be seen. I guess he was in the back office somewhere.When I told him my shipping item was $1200.00 he looked at me and simply said ""I don't care."" Well it shows, he was disorganized and and took no pride in his store.I asked him about my package being left right there in the open and he said ""make sure you have insurance."" Wow, that's comforting. Don't think I'll be going to this particular ups store again."
"Very poor experience with printing services here. Requested a quote via e-mail with particular specifications about page size, paper quality, colour etc. Received a favourable quote via e-mail in return. Upon going to this location to print items, the manager attempted to charge me much more than the quote indicated. He openly admitted he did not look at the details of my quote request before issuing me a quote, and that his quote was consequently wrong. He refused to honour his quote, or make any attempt to find a middle ground to rectify the situation. Very amateurish and disappointing."
"This is a useful neighbourhood location, but the store is run by a remarkably rude and unhelpful individual other reviews have identified that adds uncertainty and friction to the process of obtaining a package. The location is unreachable by phone and I have actually been warned about this store by drivers in the neighbourhood. Other employees at this location are attentive and helpful, but the owner is to be avoided. This has been enough of an issue that we have lodged a formal concern with UPS as I think it (unfairly) reflects poorly on them as an organization."
This UPS store has great service when we need it.  I was there with my son to drop off a package this week. The owner ( Hadi) greeted us with a big smile. He provided us with efficient service. We got confirmation from the receiver within two days after droping off the item. We highly recommend him to anyone who wants to get fast and superior service.
"For about the fifth time, today I used their printing, binding and shipping services for work documents. Lobat and her team are so helpful, professional and communicative with me throughout the process each and every time. I have even moved further away from that location, but still only use them for my important work documents as they make the process so easy. Thank you all!"
"Never in my life have I had such a poor customer service experience. From the moment I walked through the doors, it was evident that the women there did not want to help me.I was looking to ship 13 boxes to Ottawa for my work. She said I needed to have shipping labels printed which included the weight and dimensions. I told her I did not have these and do not have a scale- this seemed to upset her. I asked if she could help me with this and she looked me straight in the eye (while wearing a UPS t-shirt at a UPS store) and said ""I need to help my customers, this is an independent store, not UPS"".So here I am with 13 heavy boxes not sure what to do. She begrudgingly ""let"" me use the scale and measuring tape. She then said I need to go on the laptop to print the labels and that I will be charged for time on the laptop as well as the printing. It took me about 20 minutes to put in the information and as I went to process the payment I got an error code. She told me this is not her problem and that I need to call UPS while also reminding me that I had been on the computer for over 10 minutes and would now be charged 30 cents for every minute. At this point my patience had run out and I was holding back tears. I said that I will not pay for computer time while I am on hold with UPS. The customer service number went to VM leaving me standing there not knowing what to do. I considered packing all the boxes into an UBER and figuring out another way because I was so fed up. At this point she was weighing a package and getting a label for another customer- something I didn't think she did? I was baffled as it truly seemed like she hated me personally.Right at that moment a new employee came in. I went over to him and essentially begged him to help me. Low and behold there were other options! He was rude at first (because I had heard her whispering to him about me when he arrived) but then I think he realized I was just so desperate at this point and he warmed up and helped me out. In fact we became a little team to get it all processed and together we put all the labels on. He ran into some technical issues and apologized but I didn't mind, I was just so THANKFUL to have someone help me out!  Overall it took about 20 minutes. He was like a knight in shinning armour!In total I was in the store 2 hours and 15 minutes. This is time I needed to be at work. I will never be back to this location and will avoid UPS when I can.I don't know if the women was the owner but I truly hope she learns better customer service skills or changes professions entirely. If she was helpful from the beginning this could have been a quick and smooth process. I sincerely hope no one else has to experience this as it was truly awful and a huge waste of time."
"This UPS location refused to accept my pre-paid UPS parcels today. I am a small business owner working from home shipping anywhere between 5-15 small parcels at a time (5-30 weekly) and recently started using UPS as my courier.Tonight when I went in to drop off my packages I was told that they were not accepting package drop-offs until January due to it being the holiday season and that the driver would not accept my packages so I need to schedule a pickup or call customer service. This made absolutely no sense to me, so I called UPS customer service and they informed me that there have been no service interruptions that would make any UPS store unable to accept my parcels. I was told by customer service to seek out a different UPS store to drop off my packages at.Huge letdown. This is disrupting my holidays sales. Would not recommend this location for business purposes."
"Was third in line since 3pm... Service was so slow I waited outside for hour in the cold then got turned away right at 4 because closing time... 3 people ahead of me, one hour.... And I get turned away.. slowest and worst service ever. if your gona come to this location better come right when it opens with a camping chair and a bottle of your favorite alcohol to forget how much time you lost standing in line."
service is gooda bit expensiveCannot edit text when printing in Korean
"I dropped off about 10 small boxes last week. The middle aged female staff was upset and told me, ""You should have scheduled a pickup"".I have used at many UPS locations in Toronto, but I've never told complaints from other stores.This location is not even a UPS access point, and I am allow to drop them off instead of paying fees for the schedule pickup. There were no customers in side of the store. The staff must be trained customer services immediately."
"I used to mail my UPS  packages here without issue. I went in to mail a small parcel to the US and the guy wanted $92 for me... 1 1/2lbs small packet, not even 8x10 in size. Ebay quoted me $60 for overnight, and the guy refused to give me another option saying it doesn't show up in his system. Give me a break, reading the comments here I get the feeling only certain people, of the same background get the 'good treatement' while I get quoted $30 above what I checked and what was recommended for a heavier package on ebay. Good job, I won't set foot inside your store again and I went to the post office instead and mailed it 2 days delivery for $30.EDIT: You do have more options then overnight and DHL, because I can see them online. What's more, is one rate I was quoted was quoted from ebay itself when I selected UPS as international option. Your associate refused to give me anything other then express quote. Yet, you have express saver, expidited as well as standard. I didn't ask him for any 'special' options. As for accuracy of the weight/size/date....my package was quoted 2lbs heaver when I looked it up myself and ebay has always been accurate. A heavier package would weight more, but mine was 2lbs less, so by your logic it should have been less then my quote. Funny, no issues with Canada post, I will use them from now on."
"This store was a lifesaver for me. I went in with a request but sadly the time in which I needed it didn’t work!  However we brainstormed a few ideas and voila. I left with my picture transformed into another format and was very, very happy with the outcome. Thank You …shop local !I guess UPS means U Provide Service 😊"
"As someone that has been in the customer service industry for over a decade, the people working at this location lack the basics in customer service. They're rude, unprofessional and ungrateful to have customers/clients.  Overpriced to say the least, considering how much knowledge they lack.just based on my last visit, the older man, told me to print more copies cause one copy is just a waste of his time. Not to mention that when they make a mistake, they charge or try to charge you for it.Hands down, one of the worst UPS store/ service I've seen/ received.From the son, mom and dad. Whether it's a culture thing or not, They're in the wrong business."
"Fantastic service at this store. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful from the beginning. Then my shipment became a nightmare due to US Customs. That is when the UPS store service really shined. They dealt with returned shipments, storing boxes until they could be resent, repackaging and re-sending. After a lot of work on their part we got the shipment completed. I can't say enough good things about the staff at this store."
"I came in for a return for Amazon. They charged me 4 dollars for the print out of the return label and TRIED TO CHARGE ME FOR TAPE to help tape the package up. Isn’t this UPS, they don’t have tape for customers and don’t print anymore? What is going on?? Humans don’t have common courtesy either. I nearly cut my finger on the tape machine when I did get some tape because it was jammed and I had to un jam it FOR THEM. There’s no respect for the customer.anymore."
"Worst place.. I lost my 700$ phone because of these guys. I brought the phone to them for packing and even told them this was being returned to USA. They never told me they don’t ship international ground. They didn’t tell me about insuring the phone since it’s worth over 100 or 200$. When I lost my package, they conveniently said we are just a drop off location we can not track packages or help in anyway.Very unhelpful even otherwise.They keep their color printer defaulted to grayscale and then charge you extra for re-printing by UNCHECKING the gray scale.Will never go back there again."
"I went to this location to print 6 pages and scan/email. The first time I went, I had wonderful service from a gentleman behind the counter and he was very helpful. I returned the following day to print the same 6 pages again then scan/email and the owner, an older lady, was incredibly rude to me. She tried to charge me $4 more than what I had paid the previous day. When I explained that the day prior I had paid less for the exact same services, she said that employee made a mistake and now he will need to pay out of pocket the additional money that he ""forgot to charge me"". When I proceeded to tell her it was wrong to force employees to pay, she said that is the policy. No wonder they have a Help Wanted sign out front - they are terrible to their own staff! Stay away from this place, and if you're looking for a job, do not apply! There is no standard rates for anything and they apply ""charges"" that don't even make sense to get more money from customers."
"UPS customer service is the worst and the UPS delivery drivers are even worse than that. After having to deal with incompetent , lying, lazy people who work at UPS for over 3 weeks. (A summary being my package from a well known retailer wouldn’t be delivered to my home and they threatened to send back to retailer- giving me reasons as “you can just order another one “ “ our drivers are new” “ it’s busy(and then hung up on me -“ )I actually solved the issue within 2 minutes of talking to an employee at this access point. They were friendly and offering solutions as opposed to what I had to deal with."
Nicholas who works at this location is a stalker!!!  I have called head office and the store directly to speak with either of the owners every time Nicholas answers the phone I am told that neither of the owners are available and he continues to try and ask for the reason for the call.  The police have even called the location asking for the owner to call back with no avail.  Guess this location does not care that their employees are engaging in illegal activity and using their work phone to do so .
"Unfortunately had a bad encounter with the owner of this store. Had a package shipped from a UPS store in the US to this store, was informed prior that it could be done. When I came to pick up my package, the owner went on a long, condensing rant saying he “doesn’t pay rent for this building to hold my package” and it’s “not his job”.When I asked for more information on what the proper process was, he did NOT provide any corrective information, just continued to scold me, saying “it’s not right, don’t do it again”It was not my intention to not follow policies, but don’t be rude and at least try to help your customers."
"I used this location to ship some packages for my business as we have a UPS account. The man behind the counter was extremely rude and quite possibly unhinged. He screamed at me that “he wasn’t supposed to help me” because I had a UPS account and when I asked him who was supposed to help me he called me stupid and continued to berate me. The incident left me in tears and I felt unsafe as he yelled & screamed at me the entire time. I have filed a formal complaint with UPS, based on my experience and what I’m reading here this man should not be allowed to work there. I shipped another package from a different store and had a much different (pleasant/seamless) experience which further justified that my experience at 720 King St was not normal and not acceptable. Take the extra time and go to the store on Bloor, the lady there was wonderful."
"People seem to be reviewing very negatively against the main worker so I just wanted to say I found him to be very kind, helpful and funny. If you're not a chatty person that's fine, but I like going into a business and the person there is actually nice and enjoying their day! Any mail shop is notoriously slow, especially right now, but the staff make it much more enjoyable!"
"The owner Frank is  awesome! Unique, personable and detail oriented. What more can you ask for! Jackie is his steady sidekick. I’ve been going to them for years with my printing, faxing, scanning and there’s a computer you can work on. They are rock steady and I love the old classic rock and roll radio that is playing in the store. Thanks for being awesome and real!"
"Rudest management I've ever experienced. I requested a drop off receipt, which is required by my receiver, and has always been provided by my usual UPS location. Manager raised his voice saying he doesn't give receipts at this location and I should just look at the tracking info online. Tracking info expires after several weeks and offers no permanent record, which is important to many business operations."
"Rude staff. Treated like a second-class citizen because I had a UPS account, what the heck? He complained the entire time that he makes no money off of accounts.. He said ""I'm not touching that paper work, do it yourself. If you have an account and want to get things cheaper, I am not doing the work"". I just smiled and nodded because I didn't want him to mess up my shipment, but I thought he was a being completely unprofessional and whiny. I'll never return."
"Personally I have nothing against the employees here, or the owner Frank, he is a nice guy, albeit way too talkative. However due to the streak of enormous ineptitude and incompetence resulting in financial loss, I feel compelled to leave a negative review. Frank failed to include the signature required option on a shipment containing approximately 30,000 USD in cinema equipment, leading to a snafu upon that package being left outside of a door in a business park in California. Luckily the package was recovered. A similar incident the year before led to a package being stolen and a hard drive being lost. The 3rd and final straw has been the ongoing disaster of a mismanaged inter-company shipment of equipment to the US for a gig. Frank demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the basic fundamentals of cross border shipping, and paperwork leading to delayed packages, resulting in my team renting equipment on the other side. Not only that, due to his poor paperwork, I am being charged duties and am still trying to recover those funds from UPS. If he spent less time socializing with customers and telling stories and more time focusing on his work then perhaps this location might be usable. For any professional, or anyone interested in their package arriving properly, this is not the place for you."
"Waited 35 minutes for the sleazy guy with the greasy hair to help me.  Gave him my tracking number and he told me he couldn't look it up.  he asked my name and started casually looking around the boxes.  After about 20 seconds he said it probably wasn't there.  I replied with, ""Probably?""  He then asked me to look for it!  Then he started asking what the shipment was to which I replied, ""What does it matter?  It's my personal business what it is...""  At that point someone else came in and he started helping her with some design on her computer and completely ignored me.  I walked outside, called UPS and they told me my package was definitely there and had been dropped off there the day prior.  I went back in and told the guy I'd just spoken to UPS and they told me it's here but Frank (that's the guy's name) told me they made a mistake and to come back later or tomorrow.This guy is a total jerk.  He's completely unprofessional.  I have no idea how to get my package from this jerk."
"This review is nothing to do with the store but to the driver he never deliver my parcel to my apartment, even though he get into the building he does not deliver the parcel to my door but just stick a note on my mailbox in lobby area, saying the package is ready to pick up at store,,, this is for the service that I paid for and wasted my whole day waiting for the package.I have no problem with other courier companies like Purolator, DHL or FedEx or even with CanadaPost..I could have expect this from CanadaPost but not with UPSUnhappy Customer."
Worst worst worst customer service.Always mad attitude from the guy there.Been there few times now. Always how it can’t be done or always complicates everything. While the other ups stores are always a breeze with no issues.Change management. ASAP
"The douch owner said ""I won't stop my work to give you your package, come tomorrow as it says 24 hours on the slip"", gone back found the slip, says it's ready for pickup, went back ""well, that dumbass driver will get it from me, because I own this place, and in the contract with UPS it says I can have 24 hours! next time know it's 24 hours nomatter what the paper says, so don't waste your time coming here any less than 24 hours from when you get the note, I'm the owner, I don't have to do anything for UPS, I can do whatever I want, and I'm doing UPS a favor (the UPS Store owner, doing UPS a favor?!) by taking the packages, finally he went back and got it after 3 seconds. WTF! Will avoid UPS at all cost from now on. Worst customer service I've seen."
Horrible customer service .Not only unwilling to work but knew very well he is not being helpful because when asked refused to give his name . I send a package from Mississauga but for some reason driver could not deliver . I wanted my client to pick it up and called Bay Street office to get more detail . He was extremely rude and hung the phone. UPS should try to have more better service and pay attention towards their owner/ employee. It’s damaging their brand .
"I came to print a return label and return one bag. The guy was busy sorting letters. I sent an email to the store's email address to print as they required. He looked at the screen and said it didn't come. Then I waited for three minutes looking at him doing other work. To make sure he can receive the email I sent it to another email address of mine and to the store's email the same time. Immediately I received it and he kept telling me he didn't receive it and he could not do anything because he thought it was because of my network. Then he started to talk to another customer and insisted I should go out of the store to check my network and sent the email again. Even the next customer tried to help by sending him an email from his mobile phone, then the guy took it as an evidence of the problem must be caused by me. Finally he said I can send emails to another email address of the store and magic happened because by that email address he could finally receive my email!For each printing, customers have to send emails to their store email address, and they charge more than 3 dollars for that 'Service'. The service I got is like if there is anything not going smoothly, I, as a customer, shall try to solve it and got blamed.I came to the store many times and spent more than 200 dollars there. I would say it was my last time and good luck to others. Such an unhappy experience might just happen on me!"
"I was shipping and important package and the guy shoved my items in the box. I had to take it from him and arrange it nicely so they wouldn’t get damaged.Was filling out the form to get it sent off (which is a very ancient and archaic way of doing things in this day and age) and realized once I got my confirmation email, he had typed the address wrong. I had to call UPS directly to resolve this issue.I usually go with Canada Post but because of their possible strike, I had to find an alternative. If I had the choice I would not come back, at least not to this location."
"Jonathan was so amazing.  I called first, he answered all of my questions, he was  informative, super helpful, and super professional. No nonsense, easy, fast transaction, just the way it should be. Hassle free and easy peezie. I will definitely keep going back to this UPS Store. Fabulous service all the way!!!! Thank you Jonathan!!!"
"Response to the owner: this is the right store! On my receipt says This address and cashier name Taz!A young skiny white boy. About 5'10.Zero Stars!!!The cashier Taz was RUDE. UNPROFESIONAL. IMPUDENT.Save yourself the headech and go else where.On February 11, 2023 I walked in. Greeted him. And asked for help about returning amazon package. I didn't have my box sealed because I wasn't sure if I would put the label inside or if he would give me one of those plastic pouch labels that stick on the outside and I put the label inside.He was immediately super rude to me, telling me I can't read and such.I asked him why he needed to have such attitude.He went and sat down on his desk. After I was done packaging my box, I told him I was ready. He told me to just leave it on the counter and leave.I said I will not do such thing. That he needs to give me the tracking number . He said he doesn't need to do anything.After I wouldn't just leave my package, he got up and scanned it, and THREW the recipt in my face.And told me not to come back to this location ever again.I dunno what was his problem.But i have never ever in my whole life have had such a rude unprofessional treating me this way for no reason.Taz should not be working there or anywhere !!! He drives customers away.I will be filing a complain with head office."
"Would give zero stars if I could.... Owner or manager - not sure (bald head) extremely rude, snarly and snarky. Walked in to drop off some very expensive returns - $4000.00 worth. he directed me to just put on table and leave.... I had all kinds of paperwork, not attached, had questions... and honestly didnt want to just leave the packages without labels affixed and scanned into the system... He was so rude, patronizing and angry that I just took my packages back and walked out.. Do not do business with this unappreciative, rude franchise. Highly recommend the UPS over by the stockyards on St. Clair.Owner/manager's response to my review is that he was doing me a favour because I was using DHL. SMH....  This comment shows just how low this guy is. I have lodged a complaint with UPS directly and will contact DHL as well.  Oh and in response to your response AH..... I went to another great UPS franchise and will never come back to your shopTo other customers..... see other reviews below.... this jerk treats his customers like trash... and he can't spell courtesy!All you who have had bad experiences with JOHN, please contact UPS head office and DHL to voice your concerns..... Hopefully they will terminate his franchise contract as he is not a good representative of UPS.... READ  ALL THE REVIEWS.... and his responses, confirm who and what he is"
"No stars.The guy who works and maybe owns this location is a rude, aggressive, lazy person. He told me off for dropping packages here. He has tossed boxes around in front of me. Items dropped here are routinely not scanned. Every question or interaction is responded to with a sneer.Worst of all, I recently saw him in store, visibly sick with flu like symptoms and not wearing a mask.This guy has no time or respect for anyone but himself.Go to the Queensway location they are very nice.Edited in response from the owner to leave a ""constructive"" review:1. Be nice to people.2. Stop being so aggressive to your customers.3. Stop complaining about receiving packages at your SHIPPING store.4. Start scanning packages.5. Start wearing a face mask during a global pandemic.6. Don't come to work sick.7. Smile at people instead of snarling.8. Respect other people, including your customers.That should get you started."
"No Stars.Similar to the recent experiences from below. Owner/worker in his 30-40's bald head is extremely rude and aggressive to every customer. He sits behind his des, is extremely lazy and never wants to scan or provide a receipt. Only after arguing with this individual do you finally get the confidence your package has documentation to prove it has been accepted.This person is clearly unhappy with his life or the job that he is doing and lashes out at every customer. He likely thinks every person that walks in is stupid, yet he is the one that works at a UPS store.There are other nearby locations, so avoid this one at all cost."
"USP service was great, no complaints there.The staff at this franchise not so much,It was my first time filling out a corporate waybill and need some guidance.  the cashier Lucy in plain clothes was doing her best but it seemed to be her first or second day, we have all been there. My issue is with the uniformed worker, shorter asian  lady who seemed to be trying to teach her the ropes who was quite uneducated on UPS's services and very brief with me every time I had a question on how to fill out a form I have never filled out before.After a quick answer she would leave me and go into the back and get increasingly exasperated with me every time I would ask her to do her jobshe would repeatedly say ""I don't work for UPS, we're just a franchise"""
Less than one star . deserve zero star..... this guy has no sense of responsibility .He is very rude .I have been dealing with other ups for years and never seen like these guy.Please avoid using this UPS
Warning - Do not drop off anything at this store. It will be stolen and not delivered.Update - UPS confirmed they never received the package from your store (access point)
I would have to say I agree on what everyone saying if I could give a 0 stars i would the customer service is perfectic I called just to ask him if my parcel was there and said to.me  no and to tell me to call customer service that is not right only would have taken him a second if they keep going like this using ups logo not good for them maybe these reviews will do something soon
"Incredible customer service is an absolutely understatement.The lovely ladies at this location took it above and beyond.They took care of the packaging and shipping my wheels to Saskatchewan and made it a breeze.Just see how diligently it was packaged, and the best rate amongst shipping companies. All they told me to do was to put my feet up and take a seat. 😁"
"Although I just live down the street from this UPS store on Wedgewood, I definitely would travel regardless here to do business no matter where I lived in Toronto.  Staff are super friendly, helpful and masters of ""multi-tasking"" especially during the busiest times.  They are knowledgeable and always provide the best suggestions/options at the lowest price to all customers.  Just a few days ago, Faezeh went above and beyond to assist me with my packaging requirements to send my laptop in for repairs.  Not only did she source the perfect box, she went further to help me wrap, pack and tape up the box!!  I can't thank her enough and during these difficult times, the staff at this UPS#18 store have continued to exceed customer expectations and do it with a smile (under their masks of course!).  Thanks for always providing excellent service and just know that even the little things you do help brighten up your customers days!"
"I had an amazing experience at this location with my parcel shipment service. Faezeh was super nice and very helpful. It was my first time and she spend the time to inform me of the details, and I could tell she really cares about her customers.I highly recommend this store to anyone!"
"I usually don't take the time to review stores/services but you have to give credit where credit is due.A few days ago, I had an urgent shipment that needed to get out, but I was restrained with time (finished work late and had to catch a flight the next day). I called the store and explained to the manager my situation. Even though the store was almost closing, the store manager was very sweet and understanding, waiting for me until 7:20 to come by and finalize my shipping. All that, with a smile.She went above and beyond by today's standards of customer service! I will definitely be recommending this shop to colleagues"
"I have been using this specific location for a very long time. The staff are great with positive attitude and you will receive wonderful service. Faezeh was really helpful today and she provided me with fastest service for my job.They are polite, competent with a reasonable price. Thank - you! Keep up the great work 👌🏻👌🏻"
"UPS lost my package which was supposed to be delivered the next day. After 4 days of follow up and calls with the UPS Store and the call centre, I was advised that I have to wait for 1 to 8 business days while they will try to track my package.  I had original notarized documents in the package and spend over $150 for notarizing them plus the cost of shipping. I have to pay for re-notarizing and shipping it again plus the 4 days that UPS has wasted.The manage in their head office did not offer any help.  She just kept reading the script that she was given. Not helpful at all.Not recommended."
"If i could give no star i would but unfortunately i cant ,The employees do not know how to respect people, absolutely unfamiliar with words like ""PLEASE "" Or “ thank you” very very very  rude behaviour & you dont hear Anything pleasant ,It was my second time going there she through the mobile case which i was returning in to the bag n she said this time i do it for u next time u should do it ur self how rude can u be , i think u better go back to ur country n live there u don’t know the basics Canadian behaviour,( customer service)No pleasant word or service at all,OMG …..their attitude unbelievable rude n very very poor personality,Last time i asked them im sending iphone as a gift to Italy are they gonna charge my nephew they said no not at all I asked them several time are u sure ? Yes yes , they charged me near $280 which i said is ok if there is no charge in Italy after all my nephew has been charged for €700 i call them n asked them u guys said no charge they said well we don’t know the rule of Italy ,Ok its fine u don’t know the rule of Italy but why didn’t u inform me at first place why didn’t u said when i was asking u several time are u sure non of u said u don’t know the rule of Italy ? U guys are so cheap cheap no education no personality no manner, No Nothing , u guys thinking u can treat ppl like when ur in ur country,I never recommend that place the girls stink ."
The lady who is working on Mar 6 in the early morning shift was extremely rude and does not know how to respect customer.Impatient! Rude!Will not visit this location anymore.
Best costumer service in the whole city! I will come here over Canada post in a heart beat. Just being your packages and label they do everything for you no need to purchase extras Canada post will not even tape your label onto the box!
We have been working with the UPS Store 25 for our business needs for the past 3 years. The staff is great to deal with and very fast turn around on projects. Highly recommended them for all your business needs.
Perfect for all my personal and business needs. I'm always greeted with a smile and exceptional service.  I highly recommend this location. I've used other locations in the past but none compare to the outstanding service I have continually received from the Merivale team.
I am a Program Manager for a local charity and we have had our mailbox here for several years.  The service is great and the staff are always friendly and helpful.
"Had grievances with the store, but everything has been satisfactorily resolved. I am especially pleased with UPS Corporate management team"
charge too much and don't like  to tell your detail of charging unless you asking .  also in middle of service store owner asking leave  good review to the store.
Extremely helpful staff that went out of there way to resolve for me a difficult problem.
"Friendly, helpful staff; I had no complaints."
Phone number needs updating
Very good service
great customer service. ahmad helped my sort a driver mistake. he went out of his way to locate my package. thanks again
"Top-notch printed media, reliable and on-time service, quality expectations were exceeded. Prices are fair. Professional service like no other company I've dealt with for these services: highly recommended."
I went today with my sister for sending a shipment to my mom back home the staff were very helpful and nice.I highly recommend this place for everyone.
"What can I say, the new owners are killing it!! So helpful and friendly, this store is top customer service."
"Thank you Kaitlyn, you are amazing, friendly, helpful,  I appreciate your help ."
I had been to multiple locations to try to print and scan a pdf file and they did not have the correct acrobat reader to open the file. The UPS Store  on Montreal Road was very helpful.
Every time i get something from ups they deliver to the wrong door even though it's clearly marked on the package which door to deliver to.
I work close by and always come here for shipping. They offer many services and decent price.
Awesome
"Friendly staff and service, highly recommended this store for your shopping needs."
Got a spam call from this number just now. Hope someone can look into it. It's very unprofessional.
I hate the UPS Servises spatially this store because they never have good service 👎👎👎👎👎
"Larger location, great, helpful staff and very fast and friendly service!"
worst services ever in all company
"When I visited this branch, Michelle was extremely helpful and I was truly impressed by how much she helped out and made my task so much easier."
"I can't believe they have bad reviews. Their service has always been excellent, and I use it regularly"
Very professional customer service. I always received proper services from this location. Staff are nice and friendly. The location is very good and easy to access. I recommend this UPS store.
Really helpful staff. Took care of everything I needed quickly and easily. I'll use them for all my shipping.
Hours are inconsistent with the listing. Got there and it was closed
"Rude is an understatement, made me wait unnecessarily in an absolutely empty shop and when I asked about service and another delivery pretty much washed their hands and said to call customer service.  Isn't customer service about attending to the customer in front of you?  Apparently not."
"Every time I come to this location to pick up a package, I end up waiting for at least 15 minutes DESPITE being the only person in the store. Terrible customer service, will be sending all packages to my work address going forward."
I don’t understand why they close during the weekends that early. Don’t you want the business?
Can't get anyone to answer a phone.  Called at least 10 times during working hours
Unreliable as hell. Closes way before the time on the door.
Staffs are very polite and helpful. I visited the store for my passport photo and shipment.Their pricing was also better and affordable. I would highly recommend this place.
"Excellent service!, the staff that attended to me is very friendly and efficient, at all times they offered me help with printing the documents and sending them; I highly recommend this place to make your international shipments."
"I really love this place.  The stuff are always helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  Great service for both printing and parcel."
The guy there is always in a great mood.  The only negative is that it's in a location where you can't just pull over quickly to drop off/pick up your package because it's on such a busy street
Helped me get my package and address to China ready for shipping and when I found out the cost I declined to ship and they were very courteous.
Probably this is the only store open on sundays ..A good team also the guy gave me a discount on shipping by dhl ...A good experience
"Great Service, Very Satisfied.  Extremely reasonably priced!! Highly Recommend it!"
"Excellent, friendly and helpful. Thank you!"
"Rude and unhelpful staff, I would avoid using this location."
"Love this place!!! friendly and helpful,"
Knowledgeable Staff and Fast Service
Outstanding service!
Excellent  service
"Thank you Nabila and team for your help, you went above & beyond!"
"This UPS Store provides absolutely World-Class services! The new management of this Store is very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.I wish every UPS Store was like this."
Amazing customer service! They go above and beyond. The gentleman tried his best to calm my frustrations down and helped me out patiently. Definitely Recommended.
Very helpful with international shipping. The employees were sweet and informative. Would definitely visit again!
The women behind the counter is just rude and annoying. The guy I assume looks like  partner is quite nice and understanding.
"Very helpful staff; answered all my questions and recommended great, cost effective package for the service I needed!"
"Fast and efficient service, but I wouldn't call it nice or pleasant."
"Amazing services!!! Very professional, reliable and fast!"
Very good service. Helpful staff.
Iman is extremely helpful.
Expensive...
"this place is amazing, help me to fill out custom forms and make sure my package clear US customs, owner also can picked up from my condo dt. thanks again for your exceptional work!!!"
"Although it's not the biggest store, the customer service has always been very good.  I never wait long and am in/out quickly.  Parking is easy; either on Dundas or the surrounding side streets."
"Very experienced and knowledgeable owner/staff at this location, particularly on the handling of international shipment. Highly recommend this location."
Great service and super friendly! Bernard assisted me greatly with a project I was working on and with his help it turned out great!
"Incredibly patient, helpful and friendly. Excellent pricing for printing and other services."
This place is great.  The service is always fast and the owner is very friendly and helpful.
Excellent service. Highly recommend.
Very convenient and all kinds of services
Should have went to another ups. I was not a fan of the service
I can't even being to explain how accommodating Yashar and his staff have been. Gave me some excellent advice for easier shipping and just made the whole process simpler. I had ALOT to ship and I was shipping it far. I highly recommend these for their premium customer service and quality management of my packages!
Had a rush order and they were more than willing to help out. Also gave suggestions how I could save money next time. Very friendly on the phone and at the counter as well.
Super helpful with all your shipping needs. Also offers printing services of all kinds.
Nice and friendly. Helped me pack up my defective graphics card.
Great service at this store
Kind employees and good customer service.
awesome customer service.
Closed two Saturday's in a row. They must have only one person working here.
Everyone in this UPS are very helpfull and friendly.They  provide their services in the best way.
"Dropped off my parcels at this location a few times. The staff I interacted with were always nice and friendly. One time my printer was broken at home, they helped me print out my label although it's the shipper's responsibility to prepare the shipping labels."
New management. Friendly service. Highly recommend. Real turnaround!
Incredibly rude customer service. I cannot believe this man gets away with screaming at customers. Screaming. Save yourself some frustration and go to another UPS
Employee answered his phone in the middle of helping me and then just left and sent his wife out who was also very rude and trying to rush me out of the door.
Amazing Ahmed !!! Thanks for help.
"Super friendly staff, very prompt and professional."
"UPS lost my package and refused to provide any updates on the status other than ""it is in transit"" or referring me to a phone line with representatives who had no updates as well."
Do not go there unless you wanna get ripped off. They charge unnecessarily too much !!
Same nice helpful staff for very long time. Never had an issue.
Very kind and helpful service. Thank you so much!
"Knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff."
"Frank and his team did a great job in returning my iPad and glasses I had left in a Toronto cab on a recent business trip. After activating the ""lost my IPad"" signal, the cab driver called me and agreed to drop my items off at Frank's KIng Street W. store. Frank took it from there and now I Have my items. Great job!"
I've been coming to this location for many years and it's the best UPS location. The staff is always very nice and helpful. Frank is great to deal with.
Worst customer service experience. Package was supposed to be delivered overnight but was delivered over a week left. It has been 3 weeks since and the owner rudely still refuses to issue a refund. Not using this location again.
Worst Experience. Guy at the counter keeps talking. Does not listen to instructions. There is always a line up outside the store because of this. Stay Away.  Go to another location.
Great service and friendly attendant helping to get your parcels delivered on timely basic.
terrible experience dealing with customer service they wouldn't provide any assistance or information about the status of a package which was lost
Fast service almost no wait time and very friendly staff 👍👍
$3 to print one page. Ridiculous.
Do NOT go here.
Great customer service.
What an absolute disaster!!! What a shame for Ups for having this service. I have never walked away from something. Lost 30Minutes and this gus is literally doing anything and everything but what he has to do!!!! What An absolute SHAME
"Hi I was just wondering, due to the Covid-19, are you still opening for regular hours on Friday tomorrow? I would like to send a document through DHL express to Edmonton."
Complete chaos with long line. Go to church location if you are just dropping packages off.
Very nice shop owner
Opened 15 minutes late
I dropped off a package and it went missing. They would not cooperate by providing receipt to help me recover it even though tracking shows I dropped it off.
"Fantastic service, Dave is always super friendly and will get you the best deal on shipping. Their packing service is also amazing."
One of the best place that provides great customer service!
I’ve come here multiple times in the past year to print and send documentation. The manager and staff are the best!  Friendly and knowledgeable and super efficient!   Even better is their ability to recognize repeat customers with their masks on.  😷
"I have been using this UPS location for the past three years now religiously! Faizah and the staff are all very friendly, and go out of their way to attend to the needs of the customers! Best UPS store in north york 🔥"
"I use this UPS store for all my printing needs and also for my shipments, The level of service is really high. The store manager is really nice and her kind attitude makes the experience really good every time. I highly recomment this UPS store."
"I’ve been in this store many times, Arshia and the other lady are so nice and professional great customer service."
Best place. Best service.
"Been dealing with this UPS store for a while for their mailboxes services, couldn't be happier with their service. I suggest this location for all the small businesses owners and startups."
I am waiting here for last 1hour to ship one envelope and there is this guy here who is taking like almost 45-50mits to process. The employee is super super slow.
"It's difficult to find a place to print several pieces of paper so this is helpful. However, 2.4 dollars for one sheet is way too expensive."
"Always an amazing experience, great service all the time."
Wonderfull service and  customer service tahnks yasi
"After getting a very professional scanning/printing service done this week and frequently using their scanning and printing service for years, I really needed to let others know how helpful and knowledgeable the employees at this UPS store are.Excellent customer service and curtesy go a long way!I really appreciate their help and friendliness!"
"Cannot sing the praises of Khalid enough.  Last week my 90 year old mother was the victim of a fraud where they convinced her to send them cash using UPS.   I don't want to provide the details of the discussion with UPS but suffice to say, the only reason the package was stopped and returned to my mother was due to Khalid's persistence.  In a world with people who target 90 year old widows, it is so great to encounter a truly good person who took the extra effort to help her out.  Please, if you have the needs of a UPS store, visit this store and give Khalid your business."
"I had no idea that The UPS Store on Merivale offered so many different services. We just started our own business and surprisingly we had most of our work done at The UPS Store.  We had our business cards and flyers designed and printed, we even had our store front sign designed, printed and installed ready for business.  Everything was done within time frame we asked for and the staff was very professional.  I will definitely come back and I highly recommend their service to anyone."
"We had to ship some very fragile antique items for Ottawa to Tampa Florida, including some glass and ceramic items. We received the shipment of 4 boxes that were packed and shipped from your store to us in Tampa. We just wanted to say thank you for doing such a great job packing our valuable items - everything arrived safely without a scratch."
"Was very disappointed with my experience at the merivale ups location. I had an amazon package that needed to be sent back. I had road my bike and forgotten my bike lock, so I brought my bike just inside the door. The employee told me I had to leave it outside. I told him my dilemma and asked for an exeption. He continued to argue with me, when in that time my package could have been sent. I ended up leaving this location and will bring it to another location.The employee and manager were vulgar and rude during this altercation."
"Excellent service!!!! I have been a regular customer to this place, and never a time that I felt disappointed. I am not sure if every UPS store serves like this but there is a man named Ahmed who is always extremely helpful with lots and lots of patience. He is knowledgeable and helps the customer with every single detail no matter how much busy the store is. Pay him more UPS people, he truly deserves it."
I had to ship Christmas gifts home for the holidays and this was my first time ever going in to this UPS store. I went in on three different occasions to ship and every time the service was extremely good! I was helped by two different employees - Ahmed and Kaitlyn and they were both so helpful. Would highly recommend. They were great to deal with!
"The service is AMAZING! I called before arriving to the store to ask for the price and the time to send some documents. When I arrived they had ready for me the price and everything.Ahmed and his client service is a treasure, thank you!"
"I have experience with them to print business cards and my newly established company printings. They are very professional, helpful, cooperative, friendly, and give best advice for my business printings choices as per Canadian standards. They are very quick in finishing the job with high quality. I strongly recommend them.P3 experts Inc."
"My package was payed by the company warrenty.  not sure if it connected and so they wanted to charge me for a roll of tape because they can't provide 1.5 feet of tape to tape the box,  so I was about to pay but then also charge for debit transactions I decided to leave went to the UPs on Marivale and great service no bullshit with trying to get every dime from me. I was  disappointed in this banks street but pleased with the service on marivale."
"0 Stars for this place... I went to this location to send a package back to the Geek Squad ( their label their service choice) the bag had to be taped shut ... and they wouldnt give me a piece a tape!  They wanted me to buy a roll of tape to use their freakin service ... unbelievable.  Zero customer service , horrible experience  ,  inconvenient."
"Don’t trust this store, it’s a nightmare! My package is delayed by 13 days and they say that its not their job to help me track the package. If it is an international shipment, UPS Canada will also not give you a solution. I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice, my second shipment was with DHL through Staples and it arrived on time with no problem. If you want to avoid a headache, don't ship your packages at this store."
"First you go in and there was no sanitation available for your hands. There was only one person working and she was making loads photocopies without even given other customers a simple hello or  I will be there shortly. Totally ignored everyone. Store was very dirty, unorganized and very messy. Not sure how they keep everything organized. Their phone rang rang rang she finally answered but put on hold for at least 15 mins before a reply. Finally another employee comes in but was not much help. Oh and repeat customers who were in line were helped out first over new customers.I'm giving a 1 star because I was able to send my papers"
"I swear to god, this the worst shipping service ever. The front desk aren’t trained, the call centre agents literally hang up on you and they can never fix the issues they create. And on top of that, they still charge you high fees for the shipping.I am done with UPS. There’s no Can-Do actitud, nor pro activity and the only answer you will get from them is “that’s no my job, I am only a front desk agent”. Wake up, this is not a hostal, is a shipping companyUseless."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has meant long lines for a lot of places and thanks to all of our online shopping, UPS is one of those places. If you have your package ready to drop off with the waybill attached, then you can simply walk in and drop it off without having to wait in the line. Remember to take a picture of your waybill before dropping it off so that you can track your package! Friendly staff inside when I went to drop off my package today."
"Horrible experience with Clerk on Saturday August 17th 2013.Found them rude, condescending and unprofessional.However I complained with store owners and they assured me that this wouldn't happen again."
"We went there to take passport size photos for a US visa, and the person in charge said he knows what the requirements are. First, he didn't stamp/sign with date behind the photo. Second, turns out the dimensions of the physical photos he gave us were a bit larger (not the required size) and the photos were not cut ""squarely"" either. All edges were wonky. Highly unprofessional work and I'd suggest to not waste money here with passport photos."
"Hands down the dirtiest and most unorganized UPS store I’ve ever gone to. They charge you $3.00 to use the computer to print something or they charge you $5.00 to email them something to print. No other UPS store does this, it’s only this stores policy.The woman at the front desk was eating her food right off of the counter, she didn’t have the food on a napkin or on a plate. Just right there on her desk, she didn’t clean her hands before using the computer. She proceeded to chew and eat while trying to communicate with me, I was very displeased and will never go to this location again."
"I wish I had read these reviews before heading over there!!!  Too bad we can't leave 0 stars as the rating!  The store had boxes (for pick-up maybe?) scattered all over the floor.  I'm lucky I didn't trip over them.   UPS had given me a quote that same day for the package I was going to send out.  The store however bumped up the amount by over $5 when ringing it in. When I inquired about the difference, the store clerk refused to provide me with an explanation other than that ""this store is a franchise"".  The store clerk also made three typos on the address I provided for the package.  When I asked him politely to correct them, he first rudely told me that it ""doesn't matter"" and then proceeded to tell me that I had made those mistakes in the label I had provided him with.  I could not argue with him what I provided as he had covered the label with the waybill.  To make matters worse, I called the UPS store head office to make a formal complaint about my experience.  I left a voice mail and e-mailed them twice.  This was about a month ago and to date I have still not received a response.  My advice?  Go to FedEx on Bay Street.  I had a much more positive experience with them."
"I've used FedEx for international shipping before and they always make you fill out 10 pages of information that no one has readily available (manufacture, sales price, etc).Then I came here, gave them the basic information, and they slapped a sticker on it and it arrived perfectly safe and sound!  So much easier. Will definitely use them moving forward."
"Ya know... it's interesting.  I have had a mailbox (medium sized) at this location for a number of years now - probably going onto 4.  It's right downtown and gets a LOT of business from local businesses, lawyers and George Brown College kids.  Let me break it down for everyone:1) The store is not the neatest - yes, there's boxes all over the place - it's a high volume store that is in a small location2) The customer service is good - Amir (the owner) is fairly friendly but the problem I have seen with people that come in (when I've been there collecting mail/packages etc.) is the following - People are impatient. Amir or the other one or two employees may be on the phone with clients or with other clients and people want service ""NOW"" - be patient and courteous as you would in any business and you'll be fine3) ""The UPS Store"" is NOT ""UPS"" - I have known this since signing up with another UPS store about 10 years ago. The name says ""UPS"" but the store is NOT UPS - yes, it's confusing but it's like going into your local postal outlet that's in, say, a Shoppers Drug Mart and then expecting the pharmacist to mail your letter/package.  Try buying any Canada Post items AFTER the postal outlet is closed but the business is open. You won't be able to do it.Overall I've not had any big problems with the store but I will agree that they need to be a bit better/more organized - hopefully this will improve over time."
"Helpful and friendly service. There’s usually only 1, maybe 2, people working there. So I can be slow sometimes.The place looks messy and really outdated. And the prices aren’t the best of shipping."
"I want to take a special moment and thank Michelle and Karim for everything!I've been using UPS for over a decade, but I struggled to find an independent store that actually cares about its customers.I've been to other stores, and I never had the same excellent customer service, but I'm glad I came to this location, and this will be my only Toronto UPS store location from now on!I had to mail out two envelopes, one to another province and one to the US. The one couriered to the US arrived less than 24 hours, and I was happy and shocked that it was delivered within such a short time; however, the Montreal envelope... Oh boy, that's was a crazy, bizarre situation.The Montreal envelope had legal documents intended for the Civil division of the Montreal Superior Court House. Before I mailed out the documents, I confirmed with the Civil Department Law Clerks that the address and information on the envelope were correct. The Clerks informed me that everything was accurate and the department will be expected the envelope.When I arrived at the UPS store to ship it out, Michelle helped me throughout the whole process, and I was able to get the envelope sent out overnight priority.Everything was okay once it left the store.The problem started when the envelope was out for delivery in Montreal the next morning. Delivery was scheduled for 10:30 am Friday. Well, that didn't happen at all.For some reason, the Montreal UPS driver wouldn't deliver the envelope. The driver wrote a note on the delivery, ""Address needed updating, wrong address.""I was in complete shock and livid. So, I contacted the Superior Court House and connected with Law Clerks, who were also baffled that the UPS driver refused to deliver my envelope. And then it occurred to me the reason why the driver didn't want to deliver because the driver either has a criminal record or was afraid that they would end up arrested.From the moment I saw the driver's bogus notes in the tracking log, I was on the phone with the Superior Court from 10:30 am to closing. I spoke to eight Law Clerks just to reassure that the address written on the envelope was correct, and it was. Even one Law Clerk I spoke to was in shock because the Clerk had just received an envelope delivered by UPS while I waited for mine to be delivered.I couldn't believe it. I was even connected over to the Court House Security Department, and the Security Officer couldn't believe the situation I was going through. Although the Superior Court was closed to the public, courier deliveries were allowed to be delivered.The Guard gave me a name and room to ensure that the envelope would be delivered within the afternoon. Well, that didn't happen. The driver took my envelope and dropped it at the Lachine depot, adding another note, ""Pick-up delivery attempted."" How can a delivery end up as a pickup?Even Michelle and Karim repeatedly contacted and emailed UPS directly to get through to the driver, but the driver refused to respond.I exhausted the entire Friday trying and hoping that the UPS driver would deliver, but nothing was done, so I had to wait until Monday morning for another attempted delivery.Michelle, with the permission of Karim, seeing everything that the driver did to my delivery, offered me a refund for all the mess. Monday was another hectic day hoping and waiting for the envelope to be delivered.Once I got the delivery notification, Michelle immediately contacted me and guaranteed that UPS would be issuing me a refund due to the driver's refusal to do their job.After this experience and all the help and compassion I received from both Michelle and Karim, I will only continue to support UPS Store #479!"
"Michelle is the best UPS staff in North America.She is so rapid, clever and kind.She did not charge print cost for my parcel.I would use this location until I die."
"Always go to the lady working there. The male employee is very rude and unprofessional. Scoffs at you for not bringing your own labels or not having a brand new box to ship in. Doesn't like to do work. For one example, when I asked if he could help tape up the box and cover the previous shipping labels that weren't coming off, he gave a dirty look and was very rude. There are many more instances. Ridiculous customer service from him."
I just a really bad experience at this store. There was a really mean man that treated me poorly as a customer. I was about to send something but that awful attitude did not inspire me trust. I’ve read other reviews and maybe they changed staff recently because this man was just awful. I live nearby and I totally discard going there ever again and please attention to who you are hiring for customer service.
"Terrible customer service. I made two visits to this store to retrieve the same package. On both occasions, the clerks acted very inconvenienced by the fact that I might be looking for a package at a UPS store. Both times, they said the package wasn't there even though the tracking # and progress details on the UPS website said it was, as did the 'proof of delivery'. The second time, the clerk only went and got it when I insisted it was there and (like it did previously) pulled up the web status. Male clerk also wasn't properly masked on both trips. The store has stacks of packages/parcels everywhere and is completely disorganized, so I get why they'd prefer you just give up and leave. Use Penguin Pick-up on Eglinton instead, Staples/library for printing, or an alternate location."
"The manager of this store stole my Apple Watch. I went in to send it in for return, after waiting around for 10 minutes while he talked on the phone, he took my package and said ""Ok thanks, that's it."" when he saw I had the return label affixed properly, and kind of shoo'd me away. I don't ship many things, I didn't know the processes. I figured I could follow the store managers' advice. I realized the next day that there had been no progress on the tracking, that it had not been scanned at all. Called the store and they said they had no record of my package. I should mention that my package was a very distinct box, easily recognized as the box for an Apple Watch by someone who works in shipping, so I guess he saw what it was and decided to take it for himself.Thankfully, Apple still reimbursed me for the watch and pursued the matter with UPS directly, but that doesn't change the fact that it was stolen.MAKE SURE YOU GET A RECEIPT WHEN DROPPING OFF YOUR PACKAGE! UPS should take their franchise licence away. Avoid this store like the plague. Better yet, avoid UPS."
"This location deserves 0 stars. I work with Fedex often and I've never been treated as horribly as I was here. The man who works at this UPS location is SO rude, dismissive, unprofessional and miserable to say the least. Not sure he realizes he works in customer service - because he offered NONE. I asked for a specific slip and he ignored me, proceeded to give me the wrong one and got angry with me because he gave me the wrong one."
"This store offers exceptional shipping and printing services that I have come to rely on for a long time. What sets them apart is their outstanding customer service, especially the employee who is always friendly and helpful. She go out of her way to ensure that I am satisfied with my orders. I highly recommend this store to anyone who needs reliable and efficient shipping and printing services."
"Five. Stars -most definitely and absolutely wonderful, and over the top service from one very special employee of yours - Vinu.She gave me such excellent, professional, courteous, and friendly service - I cannot recommend her highly enough."
"I was doing an amazon return and I came with a printed label sticker for the return. The staff memeber told me that the sticker was too small and that I'll need to have it printed bigger. I was about to turn around to leave when he told me ""We'll print it for you, just send it to this email"". I was like ""oh okay that would be wonderful"". After watching him print the return label I turned around to leave, at which point he informed me that ""Wait you have to pay for that"".Honestly I was taken by surprise that the staff member chose to act like some shady scammer. It was his job to inform me of any paid serves they provided and how much it would cost me before hand. So I could make an informed decision. It's not even the money that made me upset, its the fact that afterward when I pointed out that he should have let me know before hand, he treated me in a condescending manner like I should have known better, why would I ""assume"" that it was free.This staff member failed to do his job and properly communicate and instead of apologizing for his mistake, he treated me with arrogance and disrespect.Very disciplined with my experience here."
"I  love this PO box.  The staff is so friendly.  They always email me when something has arrived.  I actually was the girl that made the mistake and picked up the wrong package not looking properly, just seeing my name and within 10 minutes the store called me and I brought it back immediately.  I love that it has that community feel :) Just renewed for another year today!"
"Been here for printing quite few times. I am quite picky in how it should be printed. Although, I prepared the file to be ready to print, sometimes, some minor editing things were still needed, so the staff informed me before printing. Other places would print them right away, not really care about tiny modifications until you noticed it on your final products. Overall, the staff was very helpful to make sure that you are satisfied with the service."
"I just wanted to drop off a box at Church street UPS office at 10:45am, I asked for a tape to close the open side of the box (for two inches long glue tape) and he asked $2 from me to use the tape!I asked if he is serious and he said yes he wants $2!I said nothing, took the box and left the store!Is it how it works at UPS offices? Why so cheap?I will never use this location!I dipped off my box in another UPS location with no charge."
"This UPS store is fantastic. Everything from the owner operators (Sohail and Nabila) to the staff who work here can only be described as exceptional.I have been a long time customer of UPS stores and my experiences with this particular store have been so exceptional that I wanted to write a review.I highly recommend this particular UPS location to service all of your personal and business needs. Have a look at their web-site to see the various services provided - you will be surprised they offer so many things including I got my passport photos done here and they were fabulous.Thank you to Sohail, Nabila and staff for making my many trips to your store fantastic experiences."
"Amazingly run store by the most friendly and helpful staff!!! I was moving internationally and was completely overwhelmed by all the paperwork and how I was suppose to ship my things over.I called the store, they answered right away and told me everything I needed to know and told me how to make it easy for myself.From the moment I was unloading boxes into the store they were assisting and offering help in every way possible. The offered professional advice from their experience and repacked my expensive monitors so they would survive the shipping and be insured.Huge help with the paperwork, I would not have been able to do all that by myself and I don't know how I would have survived the move without the staff at this store. It is sad they aren't working at every UPS store, because I know they went way above and beyond anything I was expecting.Thank you again for getting all my stuff to my new place! It only made it okay and through customs because of your help! It was incredibly appreciated and I am grateful I called your store to see if you could help."
"I want to give a shout out to the great staff at this store--especially to Iman, who has been doing a lot of work for me lately. Without exception, his service is top-rate, highly professional and speedy. He communicates with all the clients with an extremely high level of tact and friendliness. I look forward to going back there soon. Thanks to everyone there!"
"Had wonderful customer care at this UPS store.  My first time here and found Nabila takes great care of her customers.  Goes the extra mile.  Reassuring, explaining shipping process thoroughly.  Even ensured my own self packaging was done right and improved upon it.  You don’t often find such great customer service.  Would definitely recommend this store.  Thanks Nabila and staff."
"I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone who requires help with their shipping needs to come to this UPS store. Nabila and her crew were amazing, informative, and went out of their way to help me in every step of the process. To begin, I was relocating internationally and needed to ship several large boxes. Nabila explained the process to me in detail over the phone before even arriving, including estimating shipping costs, the forms I would need, and other shipping specifics. On the day I went to ship, they worked with me for over two hours and stayed late helping me with all the custom forms and ensuring my packages were prepared for international shipment. She was quick to respond over email whenever I had questions on shipment updates and checked in herself on my packages from time to time during shipment. It’s not often you find this level of personal customer service that you would find here."
It’s just outrageous how much they charge for printing 1-2 black/white pages.Every time it’s $3+Be aware that ... they charge $3 if you want to drop of a prepaid package (double charging you)... they charge $3 for every print labelled as “computer rental”. Even if you don’t touch a computer.That’s just exploiting clients as opposed to doing the right thing and providing real value.
"I went to UPS at 2100 Bloor West to get both Canadian and Irish passport photos. They told me that the Canadian size was uncommon so they looked up to see the correct size for the Irish photos. Later, I discovered on the Irish Embassy site that it was advised that I use digital photos, so I called them to ask if that could be done. Nabila told me that if I emailed her a picture of the photo (on her personal phone) so as to be sure that they sent me the right one, she would forward that and my email address to Iman and he would email the electronic version to me in the morning. A few minutes later, Nabila called me back - just after 6:30, when the store had closed - to say that they had found the correct photo and that it would be emailed ASAP. Great service! Thanks!"
"Guy didn't wanted to check for my package. Had to insist and guess what, it was there...No customers in store, not busy at all. Only checked when I showed his name at amazon's delivery notice.Update: Sept 25, 2018. The owner's reply is not true. I've handed the delivery notification slip and he said ""it's not here"". I insisted it was and when my package was in front of me I showed my DL. Bad service AND bad replies."
"I strongly recommend their service; they are professional, fast, helpful, decent, and welcoming. I tried them for different services and I am always satisfied with everything they provide.Kholoud"
"OUTRAGEOUS PRICESWent here to print a single sheet of paper from a USB stick (black and white, nothing fancy), they tried to change me $6 something, I laughed (cause I thought he was making a joke), I was then told the price was $5.25!I said no thanks they could keep the print, at which point he said I could have it for free, I gave him a quarter and walked out! How can you expect someone to pay over $5 for a sheet of paper! Next time I will go to the Library or Staples where they don't try to rip you off."
Sent 3 medium size packages from Toronto to Vancouver for moving out and I was stressed about it since I don't have a car. The owner of this store went beyond expectations to help! He helped me with the packages pickup in my apartment and done all the paperworks etc. I don't even have to go to the shop to pay and finalize the shipment. Best UPS store experience.
"Best experience at a UPS store so far. Bernard is super nice and goes out of his way to help customers. He really simplified a cross-border shipment for us by providing excellent service including pick-up, holding, providing customs forms, and communicating via email/text. Worth specifically choosing this UPS store if you are anywhere in Toronto."
"I have been using this UPS store to ship my products for the past 5 years, and I would highly recommend them to everyone! My products are fragile and are shipped all over the world and I always have them arrive in one piece in a very timely manner. I also get my business cards & pamphlets printed here, and the customer service is absolutely fantastic. I feel like this UPS store is a hidden gem in the city! 100% recommended!!!"
By far the best experiences picking up and dropping off at this location! The owner remembers me every time and makes sure that I can get in and out as quick as possible!Big thank you for making all my delivery needs oh so easy!
Went to pick up my package from this address. I was speaking to the woman at the desk when Hadi came out from the back and asked me what my problem was and accused me of yelling. The woman who I was speaking to told Hadi that I wanst yelling or being rude. Yet he continued to be aggressive and accusatory infront of customers as well.Telling me I should tell the drivers to stop bringing him packages and to deliver them. This store should be shut down or Hadi should be fired. Extremely rude and not helpful to get aggressive with customers espcially when he doesnt know what the situation is and it is non existent.
Last week my family and I needed to rush a few items out of the province as we were preparing to move. Hadi and the team made a miracle happen and got our goods shipped faster than we expected!If you are wondering where you will receive quality support or service for your shipping needs I would look at this location.Our things are arriving this week and we are more than grateful to the 514 UPS team.Thanks again!
"My experience with UPS has been terrible. It took me 45 minutes this morning to change the delivery address. I tried to do it on their website but it wouldn’t link the package and my account. They repeatedly tried to push me back to their website which I stated ten times did not work for me. Eventually someone was able to help but then I was charged to change to delivery address, even though they never left an address of where I could attempt to pick up my package. What a scam.Additionally routinely UPS is responsible for delivering packages to my office and never attempt to deliver and just leave. They do not use the doorbell and just leave even though you are there. Terrible service"
"I've been using this UPS Store location for 4 years now and they have been helpful in many ways. Recently I had an issue with a Returning service that couldn't be used and the guy at the store was understanding and helped me solve the problem quickly. They are my 1st option when sending important packages, especially for Government Paperwork, as I find that their prices and services are better than their competitors'. By the way, if you want to laminate or reduce your Vaccine Passport to wallet size, they also offer that service as well, for a very reasonable price. This is very useful if you are travelling or if you don't want to constantly open your phone just to show your Vaccine Passport. Keep the good work guys!"
"Really friendly staff, efficient services. I arrived a bit later than their close time, but they still helped me find my package with a really good attitude. I really appreciated it, I honestly didn’t even expect them to help me after closing hour! I had several pick-ups from this location with zero complaints, I can’t imagine people leaving comments saying the staffs being rude, I think they may not have told the whole story."
"The individual who works at this store is super amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is kind, patient, skilled and knowledgeable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He truly cares about his customers and makes sure that their shipping needs and other UPS service needs are met meticulously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend this store to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super great service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much for everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I have been going to this store for a long time and my experience has always been unpleasant...that is until recently. The people who used to run the store are no longer there, and the woman who now runs the store is an absolute delight. She makes going to this particular location an absolute pleasure. Her name is Angie. Because of her, I highly recommend this location!"
"We have been using the UPS Store #41 for about 10 years. While we do have home mail delivery, we travel so much that all our mail & package deliveries go to the UPS Store #41. More reliable & safer. The owner/ operators of Store #41 have changed a couple of time, the new owners -Ahmed & son Cash are great, very helpful and provide great customer service. Copying, passport photos & more. Please support your local businesses.M"
"Ahmad and his family including his son Cash and a number of other familial support have recently taken over this store and we are thrilled with the difference. Here's what I've  noticed so far - First, they have reorganized their store and some of the systems which make things more seamless, second, they are committed to memorizing all the client's names and mailbox numbers (remeber the idea of friendly service?) and third, they have been able help me with a ""sure we can do that"" attitude.We have lived away from Toronto for a number of years for the winter months and we depend on this store to receive our mail and to hold it for us until we can get it picked up. We are absolutely convinced that this will continue for the coming Winter!  Th!nk you Ahmad and family for being there and welcome to the neighbourhood!"
They are always late in terms of delivery and don't get you full refund if the package arrives Late !!Happened 3-4 times for me and at the end they told me do not come to our store !!!Never heard from other business in Canada .I won't come any more for sure.
"This is a store with a very good customer service. Nazmus is friendly, approachable and knowledgeable, making it easy to complete your services. I had the pleasure of having Nazmus help me out twice so far, for printing services related to FedEx and Amazon. He also helped me figure out from the Wayfair app how to send/email them the shipping labels. He went above and beyond. This location also has Amazon drop-off, which makes it convenient. I would highly recommend this UPS store!"
"Used to like the place until today. UPS tracker showed my package (extremeny important) delievered, but when I went to the store to pick-up, they said it is in-transit. And the lady had the audacity to ask me ""Why did you select pick-up"". Why do you care? And then being at the UPS store itself, where no help was provided to understand where the package was, I was asked to speak to customer care. She was extremely incompetent and unhelpful. Two stars are only for the guy working there who has always been genuinely helpful and nice."
"Professional and fast. The gentleman helping me took the time to explain the shipping process to me and what my options were. He also allowed me to double check that the address was entered correctly (it had some tricky spelling and formatting in it) willingly, and without attitude. Very strong attention to detail, and made the experience efficient and pleasant. Will go out of my way to ship important things here now."
"I think they might have new ownership. And it’s awful. They got rid of the two amazingly skilled workers, replacing them with employees that don’t understand print as well. And they’ve added on nonsense charges for simple prints. A $3 dollar service charge for an $.18 print. Apparently it’s to cover the costs of the employee using the computer to check for the email. It’s so greedy. Avoid at all costs. Because it’ll just cost you."
Verryyy Bad store!!!! Lying to the customersI have been told that my shipment will arrive in 4 days!but shipment received after 3 weeks!!!And he saying not my responsibility!
Frank is amazing . He went out of the way to ensure I don’t spend unnecessarily and also explained how this process worksI used to go to another ups store paying $50 for same package - here it was done for $24.5!!Highly recommendPro tip - remember to send the shipper and receiver details in advance to their store email id to save time
"Owner yelled at the girl in front of me multiple times and was annoyed that she didn't seem apologetic. He then continued to make derogatory remarks to me. Problem is, he seems to think he's funny. He thinks if he makes derogatory remarks and laughs afterwards then it's all okay. The UPS on Queens Quay has lovely people and amazing service. Even though it's further away, that's where I will be going. Honestly this should be investigated at a corporate level. Surely UPS has some code of conduct requirements."
I mail out large packages or use their confidential shredding service. There's usually 2 staff the women and the man. Both of them are very helpful and knowledgable.If you've read some of the comment the guy who works there has a unique sense of humor and does take his time. So be prepared... but his does job well and double checks everything. He's a nice person but his humor and personality isn't for everyone.Overall my experience with them is good and my packages alway get to their destination.
"This was the closest UPS location to me. The one man is very quirky and chatty. The lineup had built up around the sidewalk, I waited for an hour myself. Through his chatter, he will rant that he's not supposed to accept any packages during pandemic but doing everyone a favour. FYI Charges $3.66 for print fee for one page prepaid UPS waybill."
I thought I should leave a review for this location because I was genuinely worried about coming here because of all the bad reviews. But I had to fax something and this location was the closest to me. I had nothing to complain about. I was in and out in 5 minutes (there were only two people in the store; maybe that helps) but the staff was friendly and quick. It was a bit annoying to pay $10 to fax 6 sheets (long distance) but that would be my only complaint. Pro tip: you can get 1 hour free parking one block north on Adelaide west of King which is just a short walk away.
"Don't listen to the negative reviews, they all relate to those who are waiting for deliveries to their door.  With respect to this actual store...I have some much fun coming in to check my mailbox!!  Frank is now my friend and everytime I go in I can share a laugh with him.  I have a personal mailbox in the store. The highlights of the service include:- 24/7 access with my own set of keys- Will sign for EVERY package I ship there.  Super convenient being able to not worry about receiving shipments- Frank et. al. are wonderful people.  If you feel like you are receiving bad customer service...then maybe get out of the house more and improve your social skills :)"
"Apparently we’re just plucking prices out of thin air now. $3.65 to print ONE black-and-white page.There’s inflation price increases, and then there’s this store - no decency."
One of the best services I've ever had.I'm a customer for few years now.. And those guys are doing amazing job.. I was out of Canada for 2 years and they followed with me via email and shipped only my important packages to where I was..Also very friendly and pro customer contact and communication.Moved out of Toronto.. And kept my address with them.
The guy who works there (Frank?) was friendly but flat out gave me the wrong information.Asked for a quote to mail a parcel to Russia. He boldly stated: “you cant mail anything to russia they dont accept parcels only documents.” Refused to go any further as that was the truth apparently.Guess what? Flat out lie.  Called ups and confirmed that mailing to Russia is business as usual no special treatment. Ended up mailing a parcel with Canada post because it was cheaper. Arrived a week later fine no problem!Why lie bud? Youre a hack and clearly have no idea what youre talking about.Wont be doing business there anymore.
"Terrible customer service, among the worst I've ever had for any service period.I avoid this store because of the exceptionally rude - borderline terrifying - staff.Note to UPS - it's unacceptable - fix it. The low ratings are there for a reason."
Place is the best and with top notch service. I've been going here for 7yrs plus. At High peak hours you might have to wait a bit. Beacuse the staff is working very hard to make sure things go perfectly for their clients and customers. Please don't listen to any of the negative reviews below.Ali and his team will always do the best job for you and help you out any way they can.
"It seems I can only edit, not delete, a previous review, so I am updating it here. The internet and phone were down for an afternoon at the store, and of course, it just happened to be the moment I am in transit away from the area and need something relabeled urgently. I had no idea what was going on and was a bit bewildered that there was no way to contact the store. But, once internet came back online, Ali did respond and explain the situation. It was too late to do anything, unfortunately, but I do appreciate him reaching out."
"Our business has been using the mail box at this location for many years. Maggie & Raz the owners are amazing. Both of them as well as all their staff are extremely helpful, knowledgable and they go out of their way to make everything run smoothly. They take care of everything for our business receiving department and give us a call when we receive packages. Their store is by far the best in the area for all mailing needs. For businesses, small and large, this is your place for hassle free mailing, printing and much more services. Just ask, you will certainly won’t be disappointed."
"Jonathan did not impress me much. I had an Amazon return and he told me to ""leave it on the front counter"". When I asked him for a receipt he informed me to ""take a photo of the package."" This man is so lazy it is really beyond words. He has no shame.In response to the owner: My post was constructive and positive. Given the number of grammatical errors and sentence fragments in your response, I have to assume you aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer. Good luck."
"Had a simple colour copying job which they were able to turn around on the spot at a very low price. I would definitely go back for printing services. I had tried to use the website and found multiple instances of confusing or uncertain steps in the process. Almost gave up on UPS because of it. Called to check the price of colour copies and since it was the best, I tried the in-person option. Really happy to walk out with the job done in minutes."
"For what i can say, this UPS store, is by far the one i would trust the most to send my stuff anywhere in Canada or overseas. The owner (John) was very polite, professional and friendly. Heck!! He even gave me a very good discount on the total price, far better that the other 4 UPS stores i went before finding this one. Another thing i want to point out is that i sended very expensive packages and all of them made it to the destination, in fact one of my packages was being hold by the customs service and he even called me with time ahead to warn me about this issue so i could short it out as fast as possible. So thank you John! It was nice using your services. I thourougly recommend this place because they also send through DHL wich for me, was even better than UPS. Ten stars for John and the people that work here, very prefessional, keep it up guys!!"
"Stopped by to drop off a box for international shipping. First time sending overseas, so I had questions. The guy helping me was very helpful and friendly. We made small talk and the whole process was quick and easy.The overall experience was very positive and I look forward to my next transaction."
"I went to drop a parcel off here on July 21, 2020. I had a UPS page with a barcode that said it could be scanned at the store. The employee said he'd never heard of it before in the three years he'd worked at the store and asked me to email him the shipping label, which I did. I requested a paper receipt to confirm that I dropped the parcel off, but the employee said they don't issue receipts for return shipments and assured me everything was good to go. When I checked the tracking number the next day, it didn't show that the parcel was dropped off at the store. Subsequent calls to the UPS store were met with denial of any responsibility and I was simply told to call customer service, who asked me for proof that I dropped the parcel off at the store. It's been nearly two months, and many hours wasted on the phone, and the issue still hasn't been resolved."
John is rude and is absolutely a disgusting person. You should treat your customers with respect. If you don't like your job find a new one because there is plenty of people out there that would love to be in your position. If I could leave 0 stars I honestly would but Google doesn't allow this. Please look into John this person needs a wake up call.
"Don't bother bringing your packages here. Unhelpful and won't even give you a digital or printed receipt for drop-off. They would also not scan the package and wanted me to leave it ""at the front"".Had to drive to the Queensway location which gave me a printed receipt no questions asked."
I reached at 6:29 pm and wasn’t able to pick up my package since the “system is closed” so I asked if they would be open the next day (winter storm warning) and they said yes we will until 6:30 pm so I showed up at 4:45 pm and there is a sign that says “we closed at 4:00 pm due to the winter storm”. Now I have to wait until after Christmas to pick up my package. employees are lazy they don’t want to work. They left early because they had the chance to. All of this on Christmas weekend how irresponsible is that. I hope none of my future packages get delivered to this location full of lazy people who don’t want work.
"I have been several time to this UPS location. The staff are friendly professional and helpful. They greet you with your name and they try to find you the best possible solution and not just the most expensive one. I totally recommend them. They give you the feeling of trust regardless what kind business you have with they are always there for you and provide you with beneficial tips. Even with this Epidemie which is we are dealing right now, they do their most best to give you comfort."
"DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS! I’ve sent 4 boxes to USA and spent over $430 but they got it returned to my home! It got returned in US meanwhile nobody called me to solve the issue, i checked the tracking number it said its in transit while it got returned to my home, UPS said they cannot refund my money, meanwhile its not my fault that they returned my packages, UPS should’ve take care of that!"
"Great service! Jasmine is a wonderful manager who really cares about cleints and about people. I urgently needed to print about 200 pages and send three packages by the end of the day (CRA and immigration filings). Jasmine was very supportive and helped me very much. There were a lot of other visitors, and she was helping them too assisting them in a very professional and polite manner. The store was closing at 7 p.m., but she eagerly agreed to help me to finish my job and closed at 8. Thank you, Jasmine!!! With such people and attitude UPS just rules the market!"
"My experience at this UPS store was utterly appalling.I felt that they lied numerous times and outrageous price gouging was the name of their game.I payed nearly twice as much for the package that I sent than I otherwise would have.They made no attempt to make it clear that they would be taking a $15 charge for their ""services"" which, it appeared to me, amounted to little more than handing the box to UPS.Taking advantage of the fact that I had to send the package urgently, I felt that they lied numerous times, both outright and by omission.It was apparent to me that their service was terrible and I felt that they did not treat my shipping good with care.They gave me incorrect information about the transit time of the package.Dealing directly with UPS is preferable to dealing with such unreliable third parties."
"I have been a customer at UPS store 18, specifically this location, for the past couple of years and I am confident to say the services provided by all staff have been absolutely helpful and professional. They would do their best to help you as much as they can and if there is something out of their hands they would help you with alternatives. I would highly recommend this location for your business services."
"Very knowledgeable and professional, thanks to Khalid for speedy service"
"These guys are the best for business services.  I use them for my print advertisement fulfillment.  Khalid is always happy to help, and sensitive  to my timelines.  Keep up the good work!"
I have been using UPS at Merivale and Meadowlands for years and they always deliver on time
Slowest most useless place in the world . if you want to wait outside for over an hour . stupid people doing stupid things here . employees have no idea what they are doing 0 stars
Amazing Service! The Manager Kal is a good person. Always willing to help! Definitely Recommended!
"Asking 3 dollars for using their computer. Overcharge the delivery fee. Employee are useless, not helpful at all. Don’t go there!!!!!!"
Helpful staff and good store and service
Nice Staff…  answering the questions patiently…
Great
"I got stuck at work late didn't make it there quite intime, the gentleman was just locking up, his name was Omar.  He noticed me while I was turning to leave when I realized the store just closed, he opened the door, let me in, restarted the computer and helped me, amazing service!  Thanks again for the help Omar! Above and beyond!"
Just wanted to say big thanks to Kaitlyn. Kailyn was very helpful and attentive. Absolutely fantastic customer service.
Very nice staff and customer service and it is a very helpfull place. I definitely recommend this place.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
"I use this location repeatedly because I love the experience.  The service is always great and I normally communicate directly with one of the team members there (Khalid).  I take photos often and use the print & lamination process to create beautiful wall hangings for my home, or as gifts.  I trust Khalid based on the numerous times we’ve worked together and ask his opinion always as to what is the best approach, colours, etc.Awesome service always!"
Worst customer service experience ever with the call centre and delivery. I bought something online through Sears. I gave the UPS customer service call centre rep very clear instructions about delivery. Delivery man did not even attempt to deliver nor leave a pickup note. Redirecting the item to the Merivale location against my request. If I knew I could have picked up the item at Sears store instead. Extremely inconvenient.
"I had to drop off my laptop for return to HP that i  needed for school, and i found their staff very knowledgable and helpfull.I needed it toarrive next day but with help of the staff they were able to identify immediately that it will not arrive in one day and that it was destined to arrive within 2-3 daysThe manager informed me of pros and cons and i ended ip paying for shipping to arrive next day (which) it did as told and i paid the bill with a smile:)Will def be back"

Very good selection and prices. My go-to place for some standard items.
Best service I ever had. Good job guys.
I really like the service and the friendly staff at this location!!
"For this store, friendly staffs and efficient!"
great people!
Great service by Omar. Passport photo for my 4 year old was a breeze and great price for the photo.
"Kind staff, I had a lovely experience there, I really recommend this place."
Always polite and helpful
"The attitude you get from the staff...one man, one woman working, not polite, just dropping something off for UPS and it seemed like they were not interested. Felt very unwelcomed."
Very responsive and friendly！
Great customer service by Aihua. Thankyou
"I hate the staff here, they left a laptop I was shipping on the counter, and watched them place a large package right on top of it."
Good experience my package got to where it needed to! On time is what matters.
"poor service, $3 processing fee for print?!! ridiculous rip off"
Great experience dropping of a package
Perfect services and fantastic staff. I always go to this location because of their great customer services. They do their job on a timely manner and always suggest you the best options. I truly recommend them.
"Clean store. Very quiet. Fast friendly service. Only negative is street parking, but it is downtown TO. I recommend."
Come here all the the time it's great. Friendly amazing staff.
"The manager was incredibly rude, sarcastic and unhelpful. Did he send my package? Yes. That is the nicest thing I can say about it (everything beyond that was poor service)"
"I swear this place is never open. I've tried to go there on three separate occasions, all on different days during ""opening"" hours, and I've been met with a locked door."
I went there a passport picture and this is by far the worst place.
Hours advertised are not when they are open. Very inconvenient.
Worst service you can ever get
"lovely and very pleasant couple ..they are always so helpfulA  pleasure to do business there, no matter how busy they get ,they always have time for you"
Excellent service. The staff was very helpful and got the job done easily. Highly recommended.
Excellent  service  I ship  this location  always  very good  service
Very friendly and helpful. Used it once to make a photocopy of a few sheets - wasn't even charged for them!
"Returned my package to the sender  without contacting me , and offered no help with the matter. Knew nothing of where my package was or what happened to it ."
Super  service and excellent  staff
"Amazing people, friendly and helpful service."
Super helpful team in this branch
Good customer service.
Very helpful  people 👌 !!!!!
사람 많이 안옴
Went to this store to scan and print something- the person who helped me was so kind and helpful. Great to have this in our neighbourhood store. Won’t be going anywhere else
"There is a guy who works in this ups location his name is Iman, Iman is really kind and helpful5 star to his behavior"
"Excellent service, friendly stuff and atmosphere, great location! Thank you!"
"A fine mailbox, but they don’t open on time. Do not trust the posted hours."
"Great service,very friendly and helpful staff."
"Great service, kind and honest"
Not open as scheduled
Great Service!
The best UPS place in downtown Toronto. The guy can handle multi task and the price cheaper but quality is higher! Simply Amazing!
They do as they advertise. They go extra mile for me even it’s a mistake made on my side. I’ll definitely recommend this store to anyone.
3 stars because of the limited hours. Some of us work 9-6 and can’t make it in time for your hours. Other than that they do everything you need.
Great location for Printing and Shipping. Bernard was a big help and I will definitely return for future printing needs. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Amaizng service! Friendly and helpful with everything. My favourite store to go to!
"the staff is super friendly polite and fast, coming to this store is such a pleasure"
"Quick, friendly service. I'm glad this place exists in Chinatown."
"very convenient place, friendly staff"
"I had a very good experience shipping from this store. They are so kind and their service is very fast, accurate, and friendly 😊"
What a nice dude!
The guy at the store is extremely rude. This store does NOT even deserve one star. There is NO WAY i would visit here again.
Good location
Super friendly service
"Good shipping service, we sent several number of large packages to U.S. with them. The owner also provided pick up and also a ride back to our place. Their communication with the client can improve. overall satisfied."
Did not like the service at all. Person sitting at the front desk is very mean and does not speak respectfully
"Helped me out with my issue when I accidentally dropped off a Canada Post package here, which was my mistake. They fixed it for me."
Helpful.
"Highly recommend, friendly fast service.  Always willing to go the extra mile to make customer satisfied.  Reasonable rates and quick turnaround time."
Really big help packing and shipping something out for me. Even stayed back late. Amazing service!!
"They Staff are very attentive to my needs, quick and friendly....good job"
"All good experiences. Great staff, great service."
Careless and slow motion !
Friendly customer service and best UPS in the neighbourhood. Frank is always happy to help and puts a smile on my face :)
"Go here for quick photocopies, shipping supplies and parcel shipping. Quick in and out.  Encountered no problems so far."
2 stars because the guy there was a funny guy. 5 dollars + tax for 5 black and white pages is too much.
$4 to print a shipping label...
Great customer service. Reliable and consistent.
Excellent
"Super helpful and understanding. I was on my way here but caught in some traffic, and asked if they can wait for a couple of minutes after store closing time, and they agreed!! Thank you so much!!!"
Excellent service! Discounts are available for students.The staff are very friendly and helpful. I'll definitely go there again.
"Came on Saturday. They claim they open at 10 am. Nonsense , I came by 10:50 nobody was there"
Great service.
"The store is providing the really good service. When misunderstanding appeared, they reached me out and helped, I am satisfied :). Thank you John for your kind consideration and assistance."
Says work from 9 to 6:30. Get here 20 mins before closing and they are closed lol
Professional team. Specially Faezeh is a great person with great attitude.she is a real human. Highly recommend this branch to my close friends.
"Popped in on a saturday morning, served efficently in a friendly manner, nice clean store.  There was only one member of staff in the front office so there can be a tendency for a queue to develop at peak times."
"I would like to thank you Faezeh and her colleague, Arshia for the wonderful customer service, and organized work. Best Luck"
I use to go here for printouts. The girl here has very good knowledge on what she is doing. Very customer friendly.
I went there to print my masters thesis and the service was so quick and efficient.Would definitely recommend!
"Best service among all toronto ups stores, friendly and fast"
Nice staff.. good servicd
Very busy but very helpful.  Was able to get through in a reasonable time.
extremely expensive international delivery fee
Very good place
"They were very helpful, polite and professional."
Great service!
"Rude staff contradicting what UPS customer service tells you. Don't waste your time calling customer support, they don't know the store policies....... even though it's a franchise which should follow head office rules"
Fast service! Great customer service and amazing staff! 👏 👍🏾
"quick printing service,"
I went there on a Saturday at 11 am and they were closed. The hours say they open at 10:30 am. What a let down. Please update your hours.
He always has a big and nice smile.
Great service!
Excellent and friendly service.Very satisfied to say the least.These people know their business!!!!
Worst service not  helpful
"Not sure why people gripe about this store.  I dropped off my package without fuss, the person who took care of me wasn't over-the-top friendly, but the job was done and that's all I care about."
I was well treated by them with respect and great speed! This rating they've been getting doesnt apply to them. Great couple!
Horrible customer experience. Owner was rude. They should shut down based on the number of negative reviews.
omg so bad service
Not bad.
"Good attendance, they answered all my questions patiently while quickly attending other customers. My packages arrived safely and I got a discount coupon on my first visit to this branch!"
"I highly doubt if it’s a spam. It keeps calling me at least 10 times a day, saying that I have a DHL package."
Very nice people and the best customer service they give. Highly recommend 👌.
I ship always in this locationits my favourite placeThanks for your service.
Wish they had later hours. It's a slight challenge to get to on time. Great service though.
The lady who helped me was very sweet and helpful!
Consistently excellent customer service.
Always ready to fix all flaws!
The atención there was great.
These guts are brutal
They are the best! Speedy & Quality Service / Super Friendly & Professional Staff.
Great and friendly service! Highly recommend fer sure. :)
"Friendly and Amiable, loved the staff and the experience."
"Great place, great location and great staff, great service."
Great customer service
2 separate customers waiting for almost 20 minutes after posted COVID opening time. No show. I have to get this in the mail before 11. Going to another location instead.
Best UPS location in Toronto! The owner and the people working here are fast and professional!
Great place to have a mailbox. Bernard is friendly and kind and keeps my mail safe!
Friendly efficient staff.  Store is a bit cluttered but understandable given the holiday season.
"Nice Service! competitive rate, really convenience location,"
Kind and professional service.
I was just here today so I could get documents burned onto a CD. The guy working today was extremely helpful and friendly. I will go out of my way to come here again rather than go someplace closer with mediocre service.
"Staff are very friendly and professional, great experience!"
That would be $68 dollars please...
Tremendously helpful people! Highly recommended!
