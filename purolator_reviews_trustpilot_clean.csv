"Why is this company even in business? Delivery guy came to drop off a package, didnt knock, didnt buzz, nothing. Left a note on my door and drove away. When i called the number on the slip, i was told there is no way to track the package so i have to drive to the nearest partner office that holds packages. But they dont know if the package is there or not and there is no way they can help me, call the driver back or any form of assistance whatsoever. Based on the amount of horrible reviews you get, are you planning on changing anything in your terrible company?? Please join Blockbuster and Sears already."

They continue to charge 'reweigh' fees that are just totally wrong i.e. weight from 35lb to 74lbs and the dimensions to me definitely mean they either squashed the box or increase just enough to sting you more. These boxes are manufacturers boxes shipped to retail customers so they are bang on - designed to fit and the weight - well that is just a total joke. They won't review the case or refund you unless you have photos etc etc yet they can't provide you the same. This is not the first time. They come across the cheapest but get you on the other side. I don't recommend at all.

"I want to know why Purolator accept packages from Amazon with a rural route address when they don't deliver to them.
My package was due here June 5th,it was 100kms away on that date,but got re routed back to origin 700kms away,so after a phone call from Purolator,now maybe 12th June delivery!
Amazon should not use Purolator unless Physical address is provided."

"They made a fake attempt to deliver. I was home all day and there was not a single phone call, message, knock on the door, missed delivery notice. Nothing! Apparently, it's the customer's job to track the parcel on the app/website and call them after their fake delivery attempt. I paid for shipping and then I'm supposed to go and pick it up from their facility anyway. They are useless! Worst company ever!"

"Along with UPS,Purolator is a complete disaster regarding customer service. The woman I had the displeasure of talking to was rude and disrespectful and clearly didn't give 2 sh!ts about the problem non delivery of my package. POS COMPANY!!"
"I am leaving this review since Purolator is not user or customer friendly! I see how another consumer sees the cut and paste generic responses from the company. Shows that they really no desire to improve on customer services. I live in a rural area and quite often have issues with delivery or even getting a phone call to resolve route issues. I finally called and was put on hold and tried to file a complaint. However I was just told off by the supervisor. Fact of the matter is that even if it is the company you order your product from, the customer (me) had to pay excess dollars in shipping fees. So although I may have not initiated delivery I am still paying for the service! Go with Canada post, UPS, or even Fed Ex. At least they seem to deliver on time and have good customer service!"

I was waiting for my parcel since morning and the delivery driver left a note at the apartment's main door that the receiver was not at home. My phone number and buzzer code was on my shipping address. I didn't received any call or buzzer. Just received a email and I immediately went down to check a note was there. I paid 20 dollars for shipment. When I called them they said they can re-deliver it on Monday ( today is Friday) or I can pick it up from their shipping centre which is 7 KM apart. Why I paid 20CAD if I was going to pick it up.

"Fake delivery attempts.
Inability to deliver a package to a local depot.
Useless customer service.
Complete waste of expedited shipping $$.

Purolator is a logistically-challenged company that needs to be bought out and gutted by Jeff Bezos and a good old fashioned vulture private equity fund. Would leave zero stars. Considering going to small claims court. Will ALWAYS avoid whenever possible in the future."

"If there is a zero, Purolator deserves it.
They make up fake deliveries; they state they couldn't find the address which was clearly written by Amazon; they leave notices only by sticking them on the doors; they have no useful Chat line; they have no useful telephone contact number.
For many years, I always receive my packages from Amazon without trouble, Once, Purolator did the Amazon delivery then Purolator stated they can't find the address; the address is wrong ; they claimed that they delivered everyday as early as 6 AM but they couldn't find the correct address. Purolator should NOT be used by Amazon. It gives Amazon a bad name. Purolators' slogan in their website: Its' not a package; it's a promise; their slogan is NOTHING as they promise to NOT deliver the package."

"As usual, purolator fails to even attempt residential deliveries.

I've been at my current residence for over 7 years, and I don't recall a single instance of purolator delivering. This time, even with a sign indicating to deliver to the safe spot at the back of the house, an attempt was not made to follow the instructions. So after speaking with a chat agent yesterday, who indicated I should put a sign up and they'll attempt a delivery today, they picked my item up from the warehouse, and went straight to the local drop off for delivery spot 20m later with no stop at my home AGAIN.

My chat experience today was the usual half baked attempt to give no timeline just vague ""A few days"" answers, and ""We're delivering a high volume so it may take some time"".

Unacceptable for any non business partner deliveries. Now I'm being advised to go to the pickup location which is 3km away, with limited public transit for a 45lb item in a large box that will require me to bring my own dolly on the transit, and walk half the distance with this item on said dolly. THIS is why I paid for DELIVERY to my home.

I'm sure I'll get a half baked apology that I ""feel this way"" about purolators' service yet again being abysmal because accepting responsibility for poor service and failed delivery is not purolator will take it as a 'them' problem.

I don't want a response from the company pr team, I want this service to actually be fulfilled for once in my lifetime, and that's apparently a large ask.

But we all know they're laughing all the way to the bank because the business world is their staple service, screw the residential services that we pay for, right?"
"You know a company is bad when 95% of over 5,000 reviews are all only one star.

Work equipment was shipped to me using Purolator. I received a phone message saying that the unit number was missing from my address.

I live in a condo building with an intercom directory. If the unit was actually missing, it's easy to look up my name in the directory and dial my intercom. I was home when they supposedly attempted to deliver, so there's no good reason why they didn't deliver.

I phoned to provide the unit number and after five days it still hasn't been updated. I can't even pick the package up myself at this point because I was told that the address on my ID wouldn't match the address in their system without the updated unit number.

I phoned again and spoke to an agent who sounded high on drugs. I don't mean that as an insult, I mean that the way she spoke sounded either like she was sleep deprived or high on something. It was difficult to explain things to her and she kept trailing off mid-sentence and going silent.

It's now been 12 days and the last update is that I won't receive my package for another 2 days, meaning it will have taken them TWO WEEKS to deliver an overnight package. Simply unacceptable.

Phone wait times are 30-40 minutes long. It seems my only option is to wait.

The whole experience was horrible and I would never ship anything using Purolator.

The customer service email provided by the social media coordinator got me nowhere."

"Same old story. You are waiting at home and you get this bogus ""attempted delivery"" notification: ""sorry we were here but you weren't... forget your package for today and see you tomorrow... maybe"". You know they did not come: not only were you there, your outdoor cameras tell you the same story. How and why? What is the purpose? How in the world can it be so bad and stay in business?"
I did not hear from purolator for 9 days regarding my shipment. I am signed up for email and sms and received nothing. Today I started to track the shipment from mountain warehouse. I discovered that the parcel was out for delivery today.(still no email or sms notification. So I stayed home all day. Now I got an email saying it was successfully delivered. No! it was not delivered to me. Also I have been disconnected 3 times while trying to resolve this and when I call back I have to wait again and start over again. My time so far today 3 hours. This is not the first problem. A few months ago they lost track of my monitors for work for 3 months. Supplier could not reship until they were found... So 3 months of work with no monitors!

"Delivery date six days ago. They drove by the apartment building, wouldn't get out of the truck because the building under construction. I track the parcel in a few places, then N.B. & back to Halifax. I called twice to give them the address, which they probably had. Called today for the third time, they said they can't deliver to an apartment, they need the building number. I have never had an issue with it before now. It says shipment refused, lol, returning to sender. This is the worst service I ever experienced, I am not the only one, nothing but negative reviews here."

"Three times in the last year Purolator cannot find my house and sends me an ""address correction required"". This is maddening, considering that Purolator's navigation/address finding system is at fault. My package was due Friday, delivery was attempted the following Monday.

"Purolator is so incredibly incompetent at what they do that I will refuse to order something if I know Purolator will be the ones assigned to deliver it. Have never once had a package successfully delivered to me in over a decade of having the misfortune of dealing with them. Despite buzzer codes, phone numbers, and being home at the time of “attempted delivery”, Purolator always just leaves the dreaded slip and forces me to drive 30-40 minutes to pick up my packages from a different city. Dealing with customer service over the phone is also an egregious waste of time. This company is irredeemably awful."
"I ordered a mobile device and too bad their carrier is Purolator, the purolator failed attempt to deliver my package because they are so lazy, they did not even tried to contact or call me that they arrive and ask for some information. What the fk is the sense of your email and sms notifications if you can't notify the receiver.
Hope the purolator closed"
"Nothing less than ""Russian roulette"" I never get a delivery from these cowboys. It always takes 3 days extra to get your parcel because they post remarks like ""delivery attempted""and the easiest thing to do is collect ti yourself - but - is ""out on the van"" but won't get delivered so you have to wait another day for it. I now choose my delivery courier when possible and avoid ALL dealings with these cowboys"

"Absolutely the worst shipper today.

In 2 weeks, I've had 3 drivers not ring the door, not leave a slip. We've literally looked through the window and seen one of them just not deliver our things, basically just parking in front of our place for a minute probably just to signal their GPS that they did show up.

Other than that, the only way I ever find out about my packages is if I check for the tracking myself or if it ends up being sent back to the shop it shipped from.

Trying to deal with their customer service is terrible as well as they won't help at all with your issues. Or try to put the blame on you as best they can. For example one of them tried to convince me that my apt wasn't accessible for a slip when our door and mailbox are directly on the street, no front yard, nothing.

I've paid for express shipping, no difference. The only way you'll ever get your package is if you go to the end of the world to pick it up. Which beats the purpose of ordering things online entirely.

To whoever is in charge of responding on their behalf here, don't bother as it won't fix my situation and I've already spoken plenty with your customer service. Fix your issues internally. You can't be getting 1 star here from thousands of reviews for no reason."

"Received a notice to schedule a delivery appointment, did so. On the day of the appointment received a voice message that the package will only be delivered the next day.

Called them immediately & was told they can't do anything about the missed appointment, they will just come the next day regardless. Proceeded to change the delivery address to my home address, so I could received the package. When going to track the package I see that the change was not affected as promised & the package was delivered to the office address without me there & now I have to search for the package."

"I had been eagerly awaiting the delivery of my package and had specifically taken a day off from work to ensure I'd be available for its receipt. This was necessary as the delivery service provided no specific ETA. I made a brief trip to CoucheTard (our local Circle K) that took no more than five minutes. Upon my return, I was greeted by a note informing me that I would not receive my package until 1pm the following day.

Despite the frustrating situation, I attempted to reach out to their customer support. The Purolator delivery truck was even parked right in front of me as I made the call. However, I was informed that they were unable to assist me due to their standard procedures.

This isn't the first time I've had such issues with Purolator; it's actually the second. This recurring problem is precisely why I found it necessary to take a day off just to receive a package.

In the future, if I see that Purolator is handling my delivery, I'll immediately cancel it. Instead, I'll opt to purchase the item from a different provider, one that can offer a more reliable delivery service."

I have been calling every day to inquire as of why it's not delivered. No help from customer service either. Only promises. VERY FRUSTRATING. If I could, I would give them 0 or negative rating!"

"The excuses the company comes up with. ""Unable to deliver due to road closure."" There was a fire down the street from my apt. But rather than go up 1 block, continue down to my cross street and come down one block, Purolator chooses to indicate they can't deliver due to a road closure. Because apparrantly a detour of 1 block is a justifiable reason to screw up people's deliveries and schedules for days. Where do they get these lazy drivers. I already knew Purolator had the worst service of all the big delivery companies, but not even the smaller independent guys would use an excuse that lame. There must be litterally no reprocussions for them not doing their jobs. The reason for not delivering the package should have been ""Unable to deliver due to Lazy driver"""

"Honestly i hate purolator with a passion, their customer service is atrocious, the employees are rude and unhelpful and not one did they bother knocking or ringing the doorbell. I wish i could give less than one stars. So if you're a minor without a license or bill to your name you'll never see you package again."
I hate purolator theres always some B.S excuse as to why they cant deliver on time my packages always arrive 1 day late like today it says exception when i check the status so i called they say were having issues in ontario lmfao like i said always an excuse that why i hate it when companies use purolator to ship i know i will never get my package on time

"Horrible experience. First they left a note at my door saying attempted delivery but they didn’t even ring the doorbell or anything. Secondly they said that I will be able to pickup my package the next day at 1:00Pm. It wasn’t even there and the lady at the pickup place told me my package is in another city and I would have to call them. I proceed to call them and I’m currently in queue, probably with many others going through the same situation. Once I finally got someone on the line they weren’t able to give me a definitive answer and told me to wait and see what happens. Horrible company, not how a business should be run whatsoever."

This is the worst carrier company ever . Saying attempted delivery witch never happened. Just to screw customers paying twice. Whoever use Purolator for delivery must be aware that the delivery the customer paid for never happened.

"We were told our sign (NOT ARTWORK AS THEY SAY NOW) was TOTALLY insured for replacement cost when speaking on the phone to a Purolator employee, Yes it was damaged and they gave us the run around saying it was improperly packaged and when they saw that wasn't working they then tried to say it was art, even after ruining the customers sign (NOT ART) they won't come good on their promise. It's right in our name CANADA WOODWORKS & SIGNAGE ,we are a sign company not an ART company ...go figure? We have spoken with several staff members including Rebekah Cisse as well as the National Manager Claims Preet Noorpuri, both were left scrambling for answers BOTH were NOT qualified to do their job. Both had told us CLAIM DECLINED even though they had ZERO information about the claim at the time. We have now started an online campaign to EDUCATE the public as to Purolator's practices of conducting business. Please be aware of what they are able hide with their millions of dollars profit in advertising. We hope this helps at the very least one single person but so far from our social media post we have 128 people that have STOPPED using PUROLATOR . After the social media campaign our lawyer will be suing. Thankfully 2 ex employees have reached out to us and 1 current employee to make us aware of company practices on dealing with a claim."
The worst delivery company ever!!! I’ve been waiting for a call for 30 min!!! So they END UP CONNECTING ME WITH SUPER RUDE FEMALE!!! She didn’t help at all just ruined my mood and made me understand that Purolator is a sh*tt* service I would NEWER use again.

Worse company for deliveries. Been waiting all day. Been watching and in and out checking to find one of their stickers on the mailbox. They didn't knock I know cuz my dog goes crazy when people do. Then reading the sticker telling me I have to go 4 cities over to pick it up that's absolutely ridiculous.

"These guys are terrible. A package is sent from 80 km away. They come to house but nobody is home, so they don’t deliver it. They leave no notice in any way.

"If I could leave zero stars, I would! Absolutely unbelievable. We ordered a TV from Sony, who happen to deal with Purolator. On the day of delivery we were both home waiting for it. When we came outside with our dog, there was a note that the delivery has been attempted but nobody was home. Nobody tried to reach out. We’ve received no phone calls, no messages, no notifications. Just the note about an attempted delivery. After this we requested re-delivery on the next day. We woke up at 8 and were constantly monitoring our driveway. No truck coming. We’ve spent 5(!) hours waiting - no notifications, no calls, nothing. Then we suddenly received a note that the TV was delivered to the self pick up location. Are you guys kidding me? What if we don’t have a car??? How are we supposed to get our TV? It was clearly stated that we ordered RE-DELIVERY! I gave my phone number about 25 times on your website and you can’t even use it? Why should I take two days off from my work to get my TV????? It’s absolutely terrible service. Why do other companies always contact us at least 15 mins earlier so that we can pick up our package? It’s nonsense. Will never ever use Purolator again. Absolutely awful.


Edit: Unfortunately, I cannot reply to the Purolator’s reply, so I’ll add my comment here: what is the problem in calling your customers to inform them about delivery? Should we wait on the porch all day long? How do we get notified, if we don’t have a door bell? Why can ALL other companies inform about their arrival beforehand? Do you not care about the time of your customers at all? What is the purpose of asking for a phone number and email? What is the purpose of setting up your ‘text message updates’ if you HAVENT EVER MESSAGED ME? It’s ridiculous!"

If i could give zero stars i would. Every time I order from Amazon and Purolator gets the package I never received them. I get a message that they attempted the delivery this is the 4th time they tried they're saying my address is not right when actually I receive everything else i ordered from other shipping companies. I contacted them twice no one answered me I just asked Amazon for a refund cuz wth !?

"Entry code issue? Really?
Dear Purolator, this is beyond ridiculous -- there is a sign posted with the buzzer number for you (there is ONLY ONE SIGN POSTED), but the driver doesn't even leave the vehicle. Zero effort to deliver the package! Nothing posted on the door, no notice of delivery attempt or anything... just an update on the website ""entry code issue"". It looks like you guys are going to start your usual ping-pong and continue this game for a few days until you finally let me pick up the package somewhere? Why does this always happen to me with Purolator?"

"I am a business owner with an account at Purolator to do all my shipping across Canada and internationally.

I had a late payment fee for an invoice since I was away looking after my ill father, who passed away last fall.
I got in touch several times with their accounting department to have the fees credited due to my unusual circumstance about my father passing.
They always said somebody will contact me regarding the issue. Nobody ever did!

Then I send a shipping box to Nova Scotia.
And a week later I got an email from a collection agency. they wanted the late fees PLUS the new invoice from the last shipment, which was not OVERDUE to the collection agency.
This is unheard of. I have accounts with several suppliers for over 30 years, and nobody ever send any of my invoices to collection agencies.

I call them several times to no avail. Nobody got in touch with me regarding this issue
On my last phone call to them, they said it is what it is and did not even apologized for sending the new invoice to collection,

Sad to say I won't be dealing with them anymore.
FedEx, which I was dealing before, had a fantastic customer service. I went with Purolator since they offered me a 40% discount for a year.
Big mistake."

They drive 15 minutes past me and leave my parcel at a business that closes too early for me to pick up after work. They have no valid reason to not bring to my home!! I’m contacting Amazon and telling them to note if it’s this company delivering and if so I’m not ordering.

"We have had nothing but terrible experiences with Purolator. Every single package we have ordered through them has not been delivered. After the first instance of this, we requested a SNR sticker from the depot and placed it on our door to avoid any future missed deliveries but to our dismay our packages keep getting sent back to their depot. There is absolutely no way the courier attempted to deliver our packages as we have been home twice at the time of delivery. No one knocked or attempted to contact us, despite clear instructions on our order. We have contacted customer service several times and nothing has changed. I am very disappointed with the company and would not recommend them."

"I decided to work from home so I would be available to receive my package. The tracking app stated that it would be arriving today. Now I see an update that says the delivery is delayed due to a ""routing issue"". They sent the package 500km in the wrong direction. The AI chat bot was useless, and the service rep on the phone (real person) said it was a problem at the depot level, so the rep was pretty much useless. You have one job, Purolator. And your customer support is pointless."

This company is horrible! Their app said it was in transit and they had already tried to deliver it. I called to reschedule and they said it was “on the truck” for today. I called in the morning to confirm and again at 3pm to confirm. Still on the truck. 3:30pm the app says it’s been rescheduled to tomorrow. How do their own people not know where my package is?? Called to ask what was going on and they had no idea. How do you not know what happened? Did they drive my package around for the day and then bring it back to the depot?? Ridiculous! Companies need to stop using them until they figure it out!!!

"Purolator is only matched by Loomis by their inability to do their job. I am 8 kms from the drop location in town, so their drivers have decided to just stop coming out here and dropping EVERYTHING in town! Their corner cutting is ridiculous! I thought it was only the Kamloops location, but having read so many reviews, it's obviously the company culture. The Kamloops location can take up to 4 days to move an item out for delivery once they have received it as well, causing unnecessary delays. They can receive 5 items at the same time, and one item will trickle out each day over the next 3-4 days with the bulk being delivered on day 4, so it's simply an issue of ""We don't care!"" or ""We are incompetent!"" EVERY other courier delivers right to my door. Purolator were always hit and miss, but since the new year they have stopped all together."

"Second review. Purolator refused delivery due to package issue. Then gave it to Gardewine to redeliver. Took 8 days for redelivery. When I talked to Purolator to question everything, they just gave excuses. I also asked for them to contact me so I can be home. Since Purolator gave my deliver to a different company, this didn’t inform them I needed to know when delivery will happen so I can be home. I got a call 8 days after original delivery saying they are at my house… what a horrible experience"

"Honestly, it’s legit the worst. And it’s funny how everyone complains about the same thing, the driver makes no effort, none at all to ensure the package is delivered. I’ve literally had to wait an entire week for my package to be delivered, was home all day waiting for someone to knock and the next thing I receive an sms saying failed delivery, receiver unavailable. I have never been so pissed off cause I wasn’t even allowed to pick up the package myself.
Your drivers are in need of intensive training cause what the hell???!"

Now they are saying they can only deliver my parcel after 4days. I have had to cancel my trip and the airline is charging me an additional $1,500 for a new date.

"I have to agree with everyone who’s given them a negative review. This is the second time that I’ve had a deeply distressing and frustrating experience with the company. First, they were meant to make a delivery, but did not even attempt it. Through their automated system, I asked for redelivery. They then said it was only available at a pickup location. I proceed to go to their pickup location. THEN, the package is no longer there, all without notifications, despite having requested updates. This has caused a lot of unneeded distress, and if I could encourage every company to use one of their competitors, I would.

My advice would be for them to pay more people better wages so that you aren’t constantly running through bots and frustrated underpaid workers who are only paid so much to care."

"One star is more than they deserve. Been home all day, no one came, then I get notice from Amazon saying they attempted.

"Very POOR delivery service! If I could give 0 stars I would. i was expecting to receive my packages, however they were left with someone else that I did not give acceptance or clearance to. I work during the week so I usually get left the package slip. However while I was at work, my packages got delivered. I live on my own, but in a basement. The people upstairs took it upon themselves to sign off my packages and leave them outside to be stolen!!! When I DID NOT leave a note saying leave it with someone. & note they are not my family. I don’t get why purolator would leave it with some one else that the packages aren’t meant for?!?!"

"We will never knowingly use Purolator as they are truly awful. When we lived in Vancouver rather than leaving a package by our front door which was away from the road on a quiet street they would take it back to the Purolator store. I had to make a 16km round trip for some printer cartridges when I could’ve picked them up from Staples which was closer and had longer opening hours. Now we live in rural BC and we’re waiting for a package. We got a call to say that our home was outside of their service area so they would take it to Canada Post. I just called them to tell them which Canada Post outlet to send it to and the operator said they couldn’t do that as CP are a competitor. I told her that was not what her colleague had said in the message and she then decided she could do it after all. I’ve since learned that Purolator is 90% owned by Canada Post which makes the whole situation more unbelievable.

Prior to her deciding this was OK she said I would have to drive from Pemberton BC to Lillooet which is about 60km away over a snow covered mountain pass (it’s March).

I have two questions: 1) Why did they accept the shipment from the vendor if they knew that the delivery address is outside of their service area? 2) Are they hiring? as I’d love a job where I don’t have to think and nobody expects me to meet any kind of quality standards or expectations."
"Hello Alan, thank you for contacting us and our apologies for the situation. Unfortunately Staples locations do not hold parcels for us, they only accept parcel drop offs.

We likely only delivery to some areas in your postal code, therefore the system doesn't flag the shipment as undeliverable until it reaches the final depot. They should be able to send the parcel to Canada Post to complete the delivery, but we wouldn't be able to request a specific Canada Post location for them to send it, it would be the location that typically services your area.

"If I could leave 0 stars I would! Customer service is horrible. They claim they delivered 2 packages to me...I received 1, my cameras show 1 also however they seem to think I got 2 as I was supposed to. They said I have to give a description of the item...I didn't pack it, it's a store purchase, I have no idea what the item looks like unassembled so I am confused why I have to provide this info so they can investigate. However as previously mentioned, I have cameras showing how many packages I got from Purolator on March 1st.... I hope they never deliver to my house again! This delivery service is garbage. No wonder why their star rating is 1!"

"This company is total crap. Easy to get contract i guess when you estimate super fast delivery time. But in fact that's what they do and after you order and pay the fees they delay and delay for any reason they can think of, And if you contact costumer service get ready to be either be hung up on as soon as you ask if they pay for whatever money you lose waiting for their delivery and what a time frame for the delivery time between 8am to 9pm if you get a delivery from purolator, take a vacation so you can wait for your package they should change their name for purolate would make more sense. people should just boycott them and always ask for a different delivery company"

LEAVE THE PACKAGE ON THE STEP LIKE EVERY OTHER COURIER SERVICE DOES!!!! Why is that so difficult?

And you probably don’t even care cause people dont get to choose what service to use!!

"This this the worst delivery company on the face of the planet. They driver will never do their job. Rather than simply ring a buzzer, they will leave you a notice EVERY TIME and not attempt delivery. I work from home. Unfortunately my replacement packages for my business always ship with Purolator and I can never receive them. IF you contact customer support, they will ""reschedule delivery"" and you can do this dance with them for days on. It is beyond pathetic. What happens when someone doesn't have a car to go pick up the NEXT DAY at a depot???? they have no care in the world for their clients. Why charge for shipping IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO DELIVER IT. People rely on this for their work and you make life more difficult than it already is. Customer service laughs in your face, no one escalates anything. I have never had such a horrible experience with a company ever.
Awful. If I could leave you -5 stars I would."

"In my town, Purolator sends incoming packages to a local, private “Nelson Box Office.”
You best know that, don’t assume it will be at your door like Amazon, WayFair, or in your local mailbox on the street. The package sits. No phone number on the package for Nelson Box Office to call me.
As time goes by, only curiosity (and the need for a private investigator) reveal through tracking, it was delivered to Purolator in Castlegar, a half hour away.
Must be on its way here I think, so I wait. By the time I
realize I better talk to a human at Nelson Box Office, Or Purolator (good luck). The package has been returned.
However, the seller of my $200 headphones never gets the package back. So I’m the loser. Similar story again today with another item."

"Purolator logic: we ""deliver"" packages by sending drivers that do not ring bells and do not call and, in spite of it being 2023, require you to put up a piece of paper in the window that our drivers will also not read because, to us, delivery means the client picks up their own stuff at the shop.

So what did the idiot driver do this morning? Come, not ring, not call, not leave package... just spending fuel and leaving me a note asking me to do his job for him.

If I had known that Purolator was going to deliver that Amazon package, I would have promptly cancelled the order. You are the worst delivery company out there and you can believe me when I say that I absolutely will make sure everyone and their mother avoid doing business with you. God this company is crap.

Take my package and shove it up your lazy a**es. I'm not going. I'm not calling. F*** you."
"The delivery was not made for ""some reason"", but it was shown as ""receiver not available"", while I was there listening carefully to see if someone came to deliver. It was their job to deliver, and they can blame to someone else. And the customer agent was not able to do anything, when I ask if the delivery can be made after certain hour, and with a wide range of time window the other day, and they said""they are not able to do so"". Since me picking up by myself will result in even longer waiting time, I can only ask, ""WHAT CAN YOU DO???"" Horrible experience, or I should say, nary a pleasent one."

"Shipping I haven't had much issue with. Delivery of items is a whole other matter. On two occasions I have had shipments from Alberta to Portage la Prairie. The first a storm happened here before my package left Alberta it spent a week and a half sitting in cold dry weather exactly what the item didn't need. Throughout that week and half I continued to get deliveries to and from my place of work from every other carrier. When I called to find out what the scoop was they said they were holding back packages until the backlog cleared in Winnipeg. A backlog they expected to clear by creating backlogs in other cities.

So to the present. I ordered an item from a store in Edmonton and mistakenly chose Purolator as it was a bit cheaper (for a reason obviously). The package was picked up fairly promptly and was actually in Winnipeg by 5 pm the next day, which was a Friday. I thought why not try and see if I could pick it up and save them the trip. Now I wasn't expecting that would work out and it didn't but I really didn't care to much as the head office was on my route to one of my stops. I thought that I would ask if they would safe drop if I wasn't home to receive it or whether it would come back to Winnipeg. Sure enough, it was one of those deliveries that would go back to Winnipeg. I asked if I could arrange for it to be dropped at my workplace. He said, sure but you have to call customer service. What? I am standing in the office next to warehouse the package is in and YOU can't make those arrangements? So, half an hour later the arrangements are made to drop at my work address. Little did I know that because I made these arrangements on a Saturday and wasn't told that it takes a day for them to take effect that it would be TUESDAY they would deliver it to my workplace. So Monday they tried and failed to deliver it to my house and instead of doing the most efficient thing and drop it at the Purolator safe drop point they drive it back to Winnipeg.

That has to be the most inefficient and cost hungry thinking (and they aren't the only company that will do such crap). So, TUESDAY they will load it back into the truck drive it back to Portage and drop it hopefully at my workplace. Again, an item that shouldn't be sitting in cold, dry weather is sitting in cold, dry weather with a company that, despite having every modern amenity, chooses to use 1990's thinking. Next time I will spend MORE NOT to have to suffer the incompetence of Purolator delivery. I will even look at other companies for my out of province deliveries (such as Canada Post. At least I know that I can trust them to take my larger deliveries to a safe drop point and not drive it backwards 90-100 kms.) No wonder it costs so much money to ship with larger carriers it isn't the costs rising from a direct point A to B delivery it's the dimwitted practice of driving packages back forth between A and B instead of using their authorized drop points fully for what they set them up for. Even a math idiot could add up the dollars floating out the tailpipes of Purolator trucks.

I don't need a response to this Purolator. No amounts of apology excuses such incompetence. Clean up your company ... or, you know what, don't. I don't really care any more as I have no plans on using you again.

EDIT: It is now day two after the requested redirect. They attempted to deliver to my home again. Will not safe drop with the local Purolator agent. Package is going back to Winnipeg again. Spent yet more time talking with a “customer service” rep and he had to call the depot in Winnipeg to find out why the redirect wasn’t done. The Winnipeg depot gave him the option of redirect tomorrow (yeah right) or pick up in Winnipeg at a later date as they are backlogged (gee I wonder how that happened). I told the rep they can redirect tomorrow but that I consider the package stolen and I will be reporting it as stolen to the shipper. Maybe they can apply some pressure or initiate an insurance claim. I know that as the receiver I can’t do much other than angrily discuss my options with the poor customer service reps who don’t have much power themselves.

I’m so done with Purolator. I will stick with FedEx and mostly Canada Post as I have never had big issues with their service."

Purolator drivers have to be the worst ever.

Supposed to have a parcel delivered it was delayed three times according to weather but there was nothing wrong with the weather then they didn't follow the special instructions for delivery and I never did get my parcel been asking since Christmas why they didn't follow the delivery directions to no avail they're trying to say it's the company I bought the products from fault but it's not their driver didn't follow the delivery instructions but they don't care Amazon's kicking their butt I will never order anything shipped by Purolator ever again
"It's hard to suck more than UPS, but Purolator has managed to reach a new level of sucking that I didn't think was possible.

I ordered a sofa from Wayfair and Purolator lost it. That's right - they lost a sofa.

A team of monkeys working for bananas would probably be capable of not losing a sofa, yet Purolator managed to not only lose my sofa, but then they continually lied to me each day by updating my tracking number status to say that my shipment was heavy and they were going to contact me to arrange delivery.

When I finally contacted Wayfair, it was them who told me the truth, which was that my package seems to be lost in transit.

What a terrible business. It's impossible to be this bad by accident, which means they suck and they don't care. Why? Because they're a huge company and they aren't going anywhere, no matter how much they suck. And they suck a lot.

EDIT: Your copy/paste fake-apology reply means nothing to me. You lost a sofa."

"Consistent subpar service!
The service is unfortunately unacceptable. The rate of issues we have when packages are set to be delivered by Purolator is by far higher than any other carrier. This is unfortunate because Purolator is one of the last ""independent"" canadian carriers. Packages get delayed and the reason provided is just made up and incorrect. When calling, opening a ticket and requesting a follow up from a supervisor, we are promised a call back within 48h and that never happens. I also noticed that in some instances when we open a ticket, the package is further delayed, I am unable to confirm if it's pure bad luck or human reaction to the complaint. Regardless delayed packages should be prioritized and that does not happen with Purolator."

"I don’t usually reach the customer servise. But what a delivery system. Purolator wasted all my 3 days making me being at home to get my package and i have to pick it up. First day the delivery person even did not come and put a note I was not available. I waited at home all day, even i was checking the purolator car. Nobody came! Second day i told them to send it to pick up point because it was going to easier for me to pick it up. But they attempted deliver to my home address again. And on the live chat, i told them okay i will wait at home next day, please send my oackage to my home. Guess what? Now they delivered it to the pick up point. What a joke. It is so unprofessional business. I am pying delivery fee and picking my package up. I saw so many comments, complaints like this, it doesn’t seem ,you as a customer care, do not care as well. Since the drivers keep doing this, what is your expectation. What you do not solve these problem?
Such a waste company with useless people."

"Purolator do not improve. They never leave the package at the door. I spent 20 minutes to have a second delivery and I must write a letter signed to the driver. To my knowledge, they are the only ones like that. Yesterday I received 2 packages from 2 different carrier and it is so simple.
Purolator never leave the package and on top of that they bring my package at 25 minutes from my place!!! What a service. Why so far??
I always become violet when I see a paper in my window (which I must clean now because of the glue of that paper!). All good things with Purolator!
I try to boycott the companies that deal with them and I invite people to do the same."

i HAD ORDERED A GIFT FROM AMAZON AND PUROLATOR WAS TO DELIVER IT. IT HAS BEEN 4 ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER IT TO ME. I LIVE IN AN APT BUILDING AND IM SURE THEY ARE JUST TOO LAZY TO BRING IT UP TO ME. THEY KEEP SAYING ADDRESS IS WRONG. SORRY NO ITS NOT. THEY NEED TO ENTER BUILDING AT THE BACK AND ITS WRITTEN RIGHT ON THE INVOICE. THEY EITHER CANT READ OR ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE WHOLE THING. I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING THAT IS DELIVERED BY PUROLATOR ITS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. absolutly useless

"Purolator is the worst shipping company i would really say. They do not adjust according to the customers, they will do what they want. They do not respect the customers and their time. I would really suggest people to not use this shipping company if they want their packages. They do fake promises to the customers. I lost 2 days of my pay just because of them and still didn’t get my package and no one of them helped me to get it. They don’t even try to deliver and mark it as undelivered customer not available and it happened twice to me. I would definitely take this up and sue them"

"Not sure why companies would chance ruining their reputation and credibility by using Purolator. Apparently they attempted a delivery and found the location inaccessible, It's utter BS. Fedex and the courrier for Amazon made deliveries around same time. I playedback the security footage and Purolator was nowhere to be seen. This is a bogus claim to force you to pick up the item from their facility."

"My complaint involves overcharging. My company shipped a ONE pound small box a few hundred Km in Jan/23. The bill arrived for $76.02 ! When I called to discuss high amount I was told that the weight was ""cubic box weight"" of five pounds, plus $17.72 ""fuel surcharge"", plus $2.50 for a single paper invoice. I closed my account with these people. Goodbye Purolator....."

"Was home when they ""attempted"" to deliver my package. They marked it as undeliverable, I've been home all day. They didn't try buzzing my unit, didn't leave a slip and didn't even phone me. This is the worst shipping company. When I called to talk to a support person they were equally unhelpful."
"Got an air humidifier from Amazon, unfortunately this time Amazon was not doing the delivery, it was Purolator.
I got a notification that it was delivered a day earlier that it was estimated, so I was pleased. However, when i went outside my apartment there was no package. I checked the app again and it said delivered at 11:26, while it was currently 4:30 and I got home at around 3:30 and the was nothing at the door. Also my partner was home during the day and no one knocked. I went to the front office to see if it was dropped off there, but it wasn’t. I checked the post area just in case, nothing there.
So I contacted the delivery service in question. On live chat i was told that it was left at my front door, which it clearly was not. Then I was asked if I have checked all the common areas of the building. Sixteen floors apartment building, how do they imagine that?
Then I was told that it actually was not supposed to be left at my front door and that a signature should have been taken. So they said they would start an investigation and contact me within 24 hours.
A couple hours later I got an email from “ Jenn for Carene ext 71246
Tracing Specialist” saying that “we have confirmed that our courier delivered this shipment to the address indicated on the shipping label and as requested by the sender, did not require a signature. We will now be closing our case, and I apologize for any inconvenience.”

I replayed to the e-mail and asked why the courier did not take the picture of the delivery, as it is a standard practice; I was told previously on the live chat that the photo was unfortunately unavailable. Never got a reply.
I’m sure that the parcel never made to my front door. I will be requesting security footage from building management to see if the courier ever made it to my floor with a parcel and left it without."

"I have to admit that Purolator customer service is top notch - due to a rogue driver that failed to deliver a parcel, then prompted me to pick up at the station - I do not currently have a vehicle - Customer service personal rerouted the parcel back to me two days later - same driver delivered parcel second time but extremely rude - I really do not care - Thanks for the excellent service and keep up the good work"
"Pathetic Service.

Issue happened with me twice. I paid them $90 for each time so overall money I paid them is $180.

1st time for delivery, without even knocking my door, delivery person made a comment ""customer is not available"". Delivery person hadn't pasted any notice as well on my door.

2nd time for delivery, without even entering the building, delivery person made a comment that ""location is inaccessible because there is construction"" even there is no construction.

Taking money from customer but not delivering the service.
I'll be sueing them for sure for not delivering the package on time and making false statements."
"Shipment says it was to be delivered today. Tracking updates to attempted delivery. They did not attempt delivery and there is no notice. I went online where it gave me the option to reschedule to Monday. Tracking is then updated saying the package is at a pickup locker. No information on where this is, but if it is their distribution location it is a 40 minute drive away. I go back online and now the story is that rescheduled deliveries have to be approved and it takes 1-2 business days. Will it arrive Monday as they promised? Customer service says well, maybe. This is not a serious company."

"Man is #purolator ever gone to the dogs!

So I ordered something. Made the mistake of putting my old business shop address on it. The new tenant said she would call me when it came in.
Lmao now because Purlator said it was a box number and took my parcel back to #Vermillion .
I got a email saying they can not deliver to a box number. Lol was a store address not a Box number.
Call the 1800 number and said fine if they can't deliver to a store address (lol not a Box at all) then delivery it to my freinds house address. (She gets deliveries there all the time same as the store.)
Nope got an email saying they could not deliver to a box number. (LOL she is a house)
Again I used the bot chat put her address in it, called again gave her address. Then again I get yet another email we can not deliver to a box number. Are you people that drafty?
Then I decided on the 7th to go to Wainwright Purlator at Apple Drugs. The lady was very helpful. She called Vermillion. She was told yes I am looking at it. We will have it in Wainwright at Apple Drug's for her to pickup. OMG I get another email it has been sent to #Lloydminster. ( It is the hub. When parcel go there they are then sent back to where they came from.)
I again called Purlator at Apple Drugs told them where it was now and that would they please get someone to delivery my parcel for me to pick up at your business.
Well OMG after 10 frigging days of fighting to get my parcel that they said was a box number I had to post this. I do not see a box number on the first address, nor the second.
#Purolator get your sh**together or buy glasses for your people or teach them to read address. Something has to be done to improve your customer contact etc."

"What a horrible company, from customer service to delivery!"
I am absolutely furious with the service. Where to begin! My parcel was to be delivered on Monday afternoon and I have my exams lined up so it was super urgent for me to get it. On Monday my delivery was not sent to me just because the buzzer code was not mentioned. No notification was sent on mail or call. I tried reaching the costumer service after several attempts I could actually reach a person and not an virtual assistant. That was also of not Ny help.I have still not received any notification of where my parcel is. It is a laptop that I require on urgent basis! Nobody is even paying heed to it. Costumer service wait time is like one hour. Most horrible experience ever.

"I have been waiting for the whole day at my place for my shipment to arrive. I didn't go to work today waiting for my shipment. I kept on looking at the tracking updates and the last update I got was at 12:28pm on Feb. 7 saying the shipment was on the vehicle for delivery. Well, I got tired of waiting and left the house to run some errands. To my surprise, I have just checked now at 7:30pm the Purolator app, and it reads there was an attempted delivery at 5:02.
Well, Purolator, first of all I never received a damn phone call. How on earth do you want me to know what time to be home when all I did today was waiting for at least an SMS or a clear timing? What kind of service is this? Even right now, I have not gotten any notification whatsoever of what to do next. When are you going to deliver my shipment? Time please. Simple as that. What's the point of subscribing to receive SMS alerts from Purolator if you don't send a thing?"

I literally have no words lol they picked up my package 4 days late and now its not even updating. Its been 2 days. Its canada it should have updated lol but the kicker is the customer service people dont know how to read and never give answers just makes you question... how they have a job and its the first company I'd rather speak to the robot agent because they seem to understand better lol im trying to run a buisness and they like pffft delay pffft who cares. Well thanks to Amazon I can get packages alot faster and lots of updates. So hello more amazon options lol not trying to be rude. But ppl are running businesses theres tons of competition for this industry. Id hate to say good bye to them fully but they need updates and helpful customer service.

"Never get packages delivered to my business address anymore - they just drop off at a pickup location 15 km away from work. When I look into the tracking it states ""carrier has contacted you to arrange the delivery"" - they did NOT contact me at ANYTIME. Tracking also states ""customer requested forwarding to a new address"" - NO, I DID NOT request this. When I talk to the customer service reps online, they all tell me there should not be an issue, but every delivery gets taken to a pick up location instead of my work place."
"I bought christmas gift and it arrive at home with box destructed. The retailer did a claim (i don’t know why) but now purolator argue that they can’t take two claims.

"So the issue starts from here.
I ordered something and it was supposed to be delivered by PuroPost Plus - a lousy excuse for a collaboration between Purolator and Canada Post.
It is supposed to be delivered from the US, and the tracking only shows that order is ""In Transit"" for 5 days (even though they should deliver it by 5 days given its ""plus"")
I contacted the customer support to ask if they could help me where the package it but they're asking me to track it on the website. To reiterate, despite telling them that I can't see any updates, they're telling me to use the website to track. When I call them, they say it'll take 10 days for the item to reach Canada, and then Canada Post will take it from there and deliver it.
So a 5 days ""guarantee"" is just a sham. It will take a minimum of 12 days for the item to actually get delivered which is more than double than the promise they actually make."

"My order was scheduled for delivery Wed Jan 27 2023 - the day of the big snow fall. I had checked outside about 20 minutes BEFORE the package had supposedly been delivered to our front door to see just how much snow had fallen at that time. There was a light layer of snow, enough to leave visible foot prints. Purolator claims the package was delivered at the time stated in the completed notice, but can't provide proof, since the sender didn't request a signature and apparently quote, ""our drivers don't have time to take a photo"". I sent a message to Purolator and a trace was started. It resulted in nothing but a response that the package had been delivered and the case was closed. We were home ALL day. No one rang the door bell or knocked on the door. I am absolutely convinced that it was their designated delivery person who made off with my package and never delivered it. Specifically because there was no physical evidence of any attempted delivery - NO foot prints in the snow leading to our front door, on the front door porch, or leading away from the door, at ANY TIME during the day. I've had packages both large and small delivered by other companies that sat by the front door all day, with no one home until after dark - well past 10 in the evening without problems with ""porch pirates"". ""RING"" video doorbell made an immediate sale after that experience.
UPDATE:
I phoned Purolator after the trace. Where upon I was told that I would be contacted by some one in the warehouse to discuss the issue further. (Weeks and months went by and that NEVER happened.) Purolator's action/inaction resulted in a replacement package being issued by my supplier. I stated that I only wanted it delivered by FED EX. The Fed Ex package arrived within 48 hours, which included a photo to prove it had be placed on the front step at at 1:30 pm on Saturday. We were leaving the house around 6 pm when I found another package on the front step. NO one rang the door bell. That package was from PUROLATOR. How this company remains in business is beyond belief. Particularly when a trace was performed and my package was claimed to have been delivered on the day stated. YET that item magically appeared on my front porch THREE DAYS later. I called my supplier to inform her that the Purolator package showed up some time between 1:30 pm and 6:00 pm, AFTER the Fed Ex replacement was received. She also called Purolator to express her dissatisfaction and was told, ""what's the problem, the package got delivered."" I would have gladly returned the Purolator delivered item, but was informed by my supplier that her company had already spent enough and had written it off. Note to Purolator, don't bother contacting me. Your words ring hollow."

"I ordered something in AMAZON, it's a one day shipping. Then I tracked the package, there was a rerouting issue with purolator. I called in Purolator, spoke to nice Melissa then was passed on to supervisor. Now this supervisor blaming amazon that the label put it was 2 day shipping. They are saying that my delivery would be on Tuesday which was supposed to be today, Friday. Called in Amazon, confirmed that label was for one day shipping. Now if the case was 2 day shipping, delivery would be saturday. Still not Tuesday next week. Disappointing, she doesn't even know how to apologize for teh fault and just pass the buck to amazon. Not nice, instead of apologizing and remedy that expedite delivery, she was unapologetic, and saying delivery is on Tuesday."

"How long do we have to put up with such inferior service?
I can't speak to other areas of Ontario but where I live, I have never come across so much incompetence - which isn't a surprise considering how much incompetence there actually is in today's world - but it's the lies I can't stomach. If you order from Amazon and Purolator is to deliver it, you already know you aren't getting it on the day it says it is ""out for delivery"". I have NEVER received my package on the first day. (Don't get me started on returning with Purolator.)

However, my recent order fiasco is the last straw. They say they attempted to deliver yesterday but couldn't access the front door. Let me just state that it is impossible that they couldn't do that as the front door opens onto a public square where no cars or any vehicle can park. Then this morning they say they attempted once again - at 6:45am - but it was an incorrect address. Lies, lies and more lies to cover for the lazy and the incompetent.

Because of this behaviour coupled with the fact that I am well aware of my spending power, I will be cancelling my account with Amazon. I can't take the risk my orders will be sent via Purolator and I no longer care to support a business that shouldn't be a business. Since Amazon isn't a life or death requirement I can quite easily dismiss it from my life and I will do so with pleasure. I will also be informing Amazon as to WHY I am cancelling my account. Hopefully, Purolator will be taken off the list of available ""couriers""."

"I received the incorrect item from Amazon on Monday at noon. Had no choice but to send it Purolator back to Amazon 🙄. I went directly to Purolator on Monday at 1pm in Belleville to send it back to Amazon in Mississauga. Left Belleville sorting facility at 635pm. Arrived at Toronto sorting facility at 849pm left sorting facility at 935pm....all on Monday. It's Wednesday at 735 pm as it says it was scheduled to be delivered Wednesday. Not delivered. Called Purolator....apparently won't be delivered until Friday now. 😡 Seriously what the hell! This package needs to get back to Amazon so I can reorder it but can't reorder until the first one is returned. Getting to Toronto on Monday....just needing to be delivered down the road in Mississauga takes FOUR DAYS???? That is extremely poor customer service not to mention inefficient and takes way too much time. Next time will pay Canada Post!!! It would have been delivered in a day. Purolator is pathetic!
UPDATE: THEIR RESPONSE BELOW CONTACT AMAZON?? AMAZON HASNT RECEIVED IT YET SO WHY WOULD I CONTACT AMAZON???? THE PROBLEM IS PUROLATOR!!!! HOW ABOUT YOU DELIVER THE ITEM EFFICIENTLY AND TIMELY AS NOW ITS BEEN SITTING FOR 3 DAYS AND NOT GETTING DELIVERED. PUROLATOR YOU TOTALLY SUCK AND DONT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU INEFFICIENT UNPROFESSIONAL SLOW SERVICE!🤬🤬🤬🤬"

I am not happy with purolator as they keep delaying my parcel. The recent one is that there is a rail problem and now I can not even get a delivery date. Meanwhile I have already paid for this item to be delivered

"Horrible service!!
When I take my packages with Purolator labels on them to the stores that show up on the Purolator map as their confirmed drop off locations, they tell me that they don’t work with purolator anymore. One of the stores stopped working with purolator almost a year ago and Purolator still didn’t update their map. Just today another store where I would usually go to drop off Purolator packages told me that they don’t work with purolator annymore as well. Of course, the map of locations on the Purolator website was not updated. When I called purolator customer service to find the nearest location that is still open, the agent kept on giving me the exact addresses of convenience store that actually don’t accept purolator packages anymore! It’s impossible to find a place to drop off the packages because information on their website/or info provided by agents is incorrect, so I just end up wasting time going to those locations!
And their customer service is totally useless, I was on hold forever while an agent was just trying to confirm that the location near me that accepts Purolator return packages is still open since the hours I got from agent were different from hours showing up on google maps! In fact, business hrs of the drop off locations shown on purolator website are very often different from real business hrs of those stores that after purolator drop off services.
So today I waited for almost 15min on the phone while the agent was confirming hrs, and eventually I hung up as the box I was holding was heavy and I just went back home.
I will make sure that in the future I avoid working with purolator even if it means not placing online orders with retailers the ship and handle returns via purolator."

One day guaranteed service turned into 4 days. Refused to give me a refund even after the initial agent told me I was eligible. Sited weather delay even though I could prove it wasn't a weather delay. Story kept changing as to where the package was delayed. Will never use again.

"The delivery driver came to the front porch and waited for few seconds and drove away without knocking door or ringing bell.
I reviewed my security camera and I came to know above incident.
May be delivery guy though that I am Omniscient.
This is second time happened in last couple of months.
I am not sure why the other companies using Purolator for courier service.
Purolator is one of worst company and I am not sure how its still in business.

If there was a negative rating I would give Purolator -100! They have royally screwed up our lives by NOT DELIVERING a government document to us. They didn't even leave a notice that they had been at our house and that we could pick up the document at their depot.
"I will be avoiding Purolator like the F****** Plague.
Make an order from car parts site to my Mechanic. 1-2 day delivery. Tracking Number 333927633417 for anyone who wants proof of their BS.
They ""Attempted Delivery"" on Tuesday, which is a straight up Lie as I know my mechanic was at his shop waiting for it.
Ever since then, ""Address Correction Required""
My mechanic needs this Small, Light Package containing a Camshaft Sensor to get my car fixed... And I can't get my car till they deliver. I have been calling EVERY DAY to inquire as of why it's not delivered. It's now Friday and it's still not delivered. I am sure people at customer service are thinking to themselves why they work in such an incompetent place... They make the worst noname carriers look like a gold standard. They are seriously offensively bad. If you buy something that goes Local carrier (post canada or USPS) or Purolator which claims would be faster... go with the cheaper option because at least they actually do their F****** Job.

Edit: to the reply... I needed this before the weekend... you had it since Tuesday! I will work with the sender who will find a solution. Monday is unacceptable. Not shipping Wednesday, Thursday and friday for a ""bad address"" when you shipped on Tuesday and lied about ""Attempted Delivery"" Even if I called EVERY DAY TWICE and be told we will SHIP tomorrow... F*** Off. There is no fixing this. Never again."

"Delivery man didn't wait like 1 minute for me to get to the door and get the package. Took it to a store and dropped it off way too far away for me to justify wasting a 30-45 minute drive for a package i paid for. ( i dont have a car) Requested redelivery the same day the man ""failed"" to deliver my package. Got called 4 business days later by the store owner that i needed to pick up my package or he would have to get rid of it. I had to get on chat with customer service that day and they said it would be delivered the next day, Next day i contacted customer service again and they said it would be delivered the next day after the current delayed day."

"Could not be any lazier, unprofessional and downright useless. Sat around all day watching my tracking info with my phone right next to me. I refreshed the tracking at 3:50pm to see that the driver “attempted” delivery at 3:48pm. Certainly not here! No call, no knock at the door…nothing. Too lazy to bring the box up the elevator. I have screenshots of being connected via chat & calling within 5min to speak with a supervisor. She could have cared less & told me she would call back to let me know, as I requested the driver to return with my printer. Eventually got a call around 6pm by the supervisor (actually surprised she called me back considering her lack of concern earlier) saying it would be delivered at 6:30pm. Driver finally showed up at 7pm & yells at me that I should answer my phone as he mockingly walks away back to the elevator. Interestingly I’ve never had a problem with any of my deliveries calling me through my phone for buzzer entry & I get multiple packages weekly. Certainly no missed calls in my phone log, either. Absolutely unacceptable to waste people’s full day like this. At least the competition gives a time frame for delivery. Not Puolator. Wasted my whole effing day. Not surprised to see the low rating for Purolator. And the half-asked response seals the deal. Unbelievable."
Worst experience! They say that they called and no one answered which is a lie !!! Their customer service is terrible. Avoid them.

It was supposed to receive my package last Wednesday but there was a delay due to some disruptions and scheduled it for next day, Friday. Friday morning I was in a meeting when the courier called me and I couldn't answer it. Later I tried to call purolator back but I couldn't succeed. They rescheduled it for next business day which was next Monday. I was alert whole Monday till night for delivery guy but finally I received a message at 7PM that said you should pick your package yourself from the defined station which is half an hour away my home!

"They cannot deliver one package. All they needed to do was get one box to me and have me sign for it, but that was too much to ask.

The driver got confused and did not know the first number listed was the Apt number (this is how our postal service lists it) so they would not deliver it. Said it was the wrong address, said it was missing the apt number. Clearly, it was not.

When I called they said it was not the apt number, but the building number: it was missing a letter—the letter B.

I asked if I could pick it up. They said no. The address had to be updated first. The address... that was missing the letter B. They could not release the package or let me pick it up until the letter B was added by the sender (Rogers) to my address.

I called Rogers to ask for this to be done. They said no problem, even called them while I was on the phone. But Purolator would not answer. Rogers then had to submit a request that their ""backend team"" to submit the change in address. The change was to add the letter B.

Purolator would hold my package hostage, my property, until the Rogers team completed their task of telling Purpolator there was a B in my address. This would take 48 hours.

It is now Monday and the package is still not ready. It is in the wrong city and it may be ready to be picked up the next day. Maybe.

All this over one letter, the letter B. They had one job, and it took over 4 days to do it. Word of advice, if you see your package is being delivered by Purolator, check the address, ask that it's correct and pray it gets to you.

One job."
"Hi Shawn, thank you for taking the time to write this review. Rogers has a contact that is reached out to for any address corrections. These corrections can take 24-48 hours to be completed.

"NEVER USE PURILATOR!!! Terrible customer service and you never get your packages. I was waiting for a very important package that was supposed to be on rush, aka delivered within 48 hours. Its been almost 2 weeks. Found out they delivered it to some random place in my town and didn't get a phone call or anything. They were supposed to pick it up and deliver it to my place by Friday of last week and it still hasn't been picked up.
Called in and customer service says oh you entered your address wrong. Sure didn't! I also confirmed my address with them the week prior. They had it right. They just wanted to pass the blame.
Horrible, horrible customer service."

"If icould give minus 5 star review I would be glad. Purchased an item from timberland in Ontario and supposed to be in Edmonton Alberta by end of the week. Item showed picked up by Puro late or on Monday and on Saturday it shows ""missed connection"".. called customer care of pure late or ( purolator) and the arrogant Emily who denied to provide her customer care representative number said ""the roads were bad in Alberta so the driver couldn't make it to the hub in Alberta on time . So convenient for her to make up that lie!! She then said it's still in Ontario. I told her Edmonton is not in Ontario!! What a wonderful ignorance by Purolator representatives !! I asked her why its not being shown on purolator website when I track ... she said it's only for their officials to see and not for customers with a tracking number!! Agin what a great service!! I had to literally call and hold on line for 35 minutes to get this update and this Emily was one of the rudest and impatient customer rep I ever dealt with in my life with purolator!!
I am also going to file a complaint with Timberland for using this ridiculous company..
So unfortunate"
"I'm writing about EVERY single interaction I've had with Purolator in the last couple of years. Rude drivers, horrible phone/web service and unreliable. 2 packages in a row have been held locally due to poor weather, and there is no weather issues in my area. The guy I spoke with on the phone tried to explain it, but had no real reason. Its 9 degrees and cloudy today.

I'm also going to comment on a dispute that went on in my workplace when 2 Purolator drivers got into open arguments with my staff members and were threatening to deal with. We are now going out of our way to avoid using Purolator all together, FedEx has been for better for reliability and customer service.

I hope you guys can sort it out, this is really bad."

"Waiting for package sent by my workplace. Package sent from Gatineau to Ottawa. Here is the tracking:

Mon. Jan. 9, 2023 - 11:47 a.m. Purolator Shipping label created
Thu. Jan. 12, 2023 - 2:09 p.m. HULL, PQ Picked up by Purolator at GATINEAU QC
Thu. Jan. 12, 2023 - 9:48 p.m. MONTREAL SORT CTR/CTR TRI, PQ Departed sort facility
Thu. Jan. 12, 2023 - 10:03 p.m. HULL, PQ Departed sort facility

It is Jan 13, 2023 , 18:15 now. Still waiting.

Update: Package received on Jan 14.
Still, you really have bad delivery/sorting model. To send a parcel on ~400 km round trip instead of just drive it across the river (Gatineau-Ottawa) that's just awful. I could drive there and pick it up within an hour round trip. I would accept 1.5 days delivery from the delivery service, but for this to take 5 days, it's just bad."
Ive been trying to get my phone replaced for 2 weeks now. The issue both times has been Purolator. I have everything shipped to my work because it's safer then leaving things in my mail box. So they send it and don't put the business name on the package. I double checked with the shipper and they said they did. So I tried to get into contact with Purolator where they said that the only changes they can make is adding a buzzer code they can't add a business name. They literally said they could contact the driver but they wouldn't be able to do it they can only add a buzzer code. Soo they wouldn't deliver it. I asked if I could go pick it up at the depot but because I have it going to my place of work not my home my ID wouldn't be good enough. I had to wait for the package to be returned to sender for them to ship it out again. Which they did and they verified again that it has the business name on the package. Get my tracking number. No business name. So I contact Purolator again. They will not add the business address to the package. I had to have the shipping company contact them and they finally add the business name and contact the driver. Hours later my tracking number changes from in transit on the truck to delayed due to sorting. How can there be a sorting issue while on the truck? I've never had so much issue getting a package and now I still won't have a phone for 2 more days cuz it's the weekend. I will go out of my way to never use Purolator again. Even at work we ship out hundreds of packages a month and we use an app that lets us choose the best cheapest option. Even if Purolator is the best option I will pay more to never give a dime to this company. Worst customer service experience I've ever had.
"No delivery once again. Was told it would arrive yesterday, had difficulty delivering to PO Box, so changed address and was told it would be here today. Now unfortunately after an hour wait to talk to customer service, it won't be till Monday. Previously had purolator deliver to a business here also, which they also did not do. Had to pick up the package 40 minutes away instead. Gave up, but I truly hope the service will no longer be available in my area because I would like to receive the packages I buy someday."
"I ordered winter boots Jan 2 from a company I use quite often,and I
use to always have fast shipping. I don’t know why they used purolator this times. There is no tracking update on their site and I need those boots Monday. Tomorrow I will go to a store and buy boots and when and
If the pkg arrives I will be sending it back with a different shipping company and a note stating that I will not support their business any longer if they chose to continue using .purolator!!!
I had the same experience with them a few months ago.
Canada post takes 5 days max! People who pay to use this “shipping” company should be refunded every damn time! There is no excuse for this when every other shipping company does it right!"

"I was promised a 24h delivery by Amazon but I had the badluck that they chose Purolator for giving me my product. They were unable to deliver my package, so they just decided to keep it for 5 days without reason. I had to call several times to receive my order because they were unable to deliver packages correctly to my address. On several occasions, they have confirmed delivery dates to me that they have not respected. I had given, several times again, clear indications that the package had to be delivered to my address EVEN IF I WAS NOT THERE, like every other normal Amazon delivery, and they kept leaving WITH my package. Now I need to take a bus to get my box tomorrow. A delivery who was supposed to take 24h, took in fact 5 days.
I would have thought that this was just a bad luck but, literally EVERY SINGLE TIME I get a package delivered by Purolator, they manage to mess it up and I have to call your their consumer service that keep me waiting for an hour."

"- Did not attempt to deliver my package
- Did not leave a notice.
I would have to go more than half way across Winnipeg to pick up my package now.
Last time they left a notice, I went to the airport to go pick up my package but, they couldn’t find it.
What kind of garbage service is this?
Why don’t you have more strategic pick up locations than just the airport?
I will now refuse to go to the airport to pick up my packages.
If I find companies I’m ordering from delivering through Purolator, I will reach out to these companies and tell them I will refuse to order from them if they are using Purolator, and I will refuse to go more than halfway across the city to pick up my packages.
Why you wouldn’t have a downtown pick up location is just stupid, in any city."

OK. They should really knock when delivering. I agree with that. But I think people should stop being so entitled. Yes stuf happens all the time. It happens that they are late. But personally I've seen way worse! I have no issues with their service. Except knock! Lol anyways. I feel that people nowadays only look for reasons to complain. They complain about the couple times things went sideways. But forgets the 100 packages that arrived on time or even arrived early. These people works hard. Respect... yes there's bad workers in every field of work... get over it. Sorry for the ranting. But we should be more understanding... have a good day. 🙂

"I’m giving a 3 because they actually left my package which I see is not the case for a lot of others. But I’m not giving any higher for a few reasons.

First, your tracking showed it sitting for over 5 days without any update as to what was going on. Second, no one knocked when they dropped it off and left it flat in the middle of my porch. Didn’t even attempted to prop it against the door or hide it in the MANY places my porch provides, including a screen door room that is not locked whatsoever ever. This was a small Amazon package in one of there little paper mailers, I didn’t think it would be hard to either place it nicely or hide it better.

I know your drivers may be busy but quality of service shouldn’t suffer because of it. As a former delivery driver I could never imagine putting that little care into delivering something as to not even knock."
"Absolutely the worst delivery company ever and has useless representatives that can assure the package will be delivered. The delivery guy does not even knock or ring the doorbell BUT just leaves a note saying they missed me. I have the CCTV footage that captures how effortlessly the driver just leaves the note and drives away. The driver didn't even leave their contact number to call back or neither call the recipients when they arrive at the premise. I live in the basement and no effort is made to ensure the package is delivered. My house owner was also in the house when the delivery guys came and heard nothing. I had to call customer service and wait 1 hour before I can be attended to. When I ask for re-delivery, the answer I got was subject to availability. MY FOOT! PLEASE DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY. don't waste your time. Purolator - If you cannot commit to customer satisfaction and end-user experience, do not run a servicing company. JOKERS"

On going weather delay. No bad weather for weeks between where I am and where the package is. They finally admitted they are just backed up. They lied and put weather as that is out of their control. If you can’t deliver on time don’t make up excuses!!!

"I see everyone has the same complaints as myself. Today Purolator says they attempted to deliver my package. I was home at the time. No knock at the door, no ringing of doorbell. Just a notice saying they were there and to go to the pickup location. If I wanted it delivered that way I would of stated on the delivery form. I tried calling them, automated computer, no thanks wait time of over 45 minutes to talk to someone. Yah no!!!! What a joke. Any other delivery service I deal with I’ve never had an issue with."

"Yo what? What kind of service is this? My package was supposed to be delivered on 5th and it’s 9th today , and they do not know where my package is

They told me it’s with a 3rd part agent who help them with packages and they also won’t release information who the hell has it. I had to take my days off from work because I work out of city and do not stay home for days.

It was a bed frame , are you guys finding it heavy pick or what

Terrible service."

"Purolator is the worst delivery company I’ve ever seen. Seriously?
What the hell is going on? Are we not paying for the shi* or something? Your drivers don’t even bother to call us and then simply say “ we missed you” what the f*** is this? Do you even ask them if they are trying to reach us? This is literally the 4th time I am experiencing this and it’s repeating over and over again. Poor management!
Don’t you bother to reply me that we’re sorry for it bla bla, you better freaking work on the deliveries and your drivers.
Thanks for reading. Hope it helps. Tbh If I have the option of giving you less than 1 star I’d love to!

"Purolator is the worst shipping company ever. They either cannot find the building, or intercom on the wall, or have no idea how to use intercom or something else. They only imitate one delivery attempt (I was at home that time) and then you have to drive there to pick up your package. Weekends they closed! Almost never had an issue with all other deliveries, but only with the Purolator. Don't understand why it still exists."

"I’ve never had a good experience with Purolator Delivery Service. But this time is laughable show the laziness of their company. I had one of two package package 2 showed up on time. Both of them were in Richmond Next day I received a noticed saying my packaged was delayed to due weather. I look out my window I’m 10 minutes away from the Richmond place. And it’s very very sunny here. I phone, was told it’s the weather in Toronto. But I’m in Vancouver and the package is in sunny Richmond. Yes they say but it’s snowing in Toronto. A two days later I get the email my package is out for delivery, at 5 pm I get an update it’s delayed due to weather. I guess it starting snowing in Toronto. Deliver date is not provided and who knows when I’ll get my package. And if I’m not home when they decide to deliver after all their lies they will take the parcel to Burnaby 1/2 hour away from my place. And as they did before and yes try and have it redelivered is impossible. Purolator’s slogan “it’s a promise” liars. Back to package to the first package. I should be happy that the driver phoned me even though my buzzer number and delivery instructions were on the package, When he didn’t show up at my door I went to see where he was. Despite the instructions to come to the apartment, he said he left in our mail room. Our mail room? Our unsafe walk way where the mail boxes our. Lazy, Lairs, Lunatics. That should be their slogan.

Not impressed with the company who used them and promised me I would receive my order in 3-4 business days"

"Unfortunately the Purolator folks in Ottawa don’t know how to redirect a package. They keep going to the same non-existent address. I’ve called 7 times. Yes 7! The computer has the right address; everybody has the right address, but the folks here are too lazy to change the label on the package. I guess that’s what you get dealing with a Government Crown Corporation. Tracking # djg000002934."

Horrible shipping company. I used to think that FedEx was bad but man purolator takes the cake. I had a package that they “attempted delivery” but they didn’t I was home all day and never rang the doorbell just stuck the slip to my door. I always have to go pick up any purolator packages and the depo is no where near I live and in the opposite end of the city. What’s the point of online shopping if I have to keep picking the up. Useless shipping service and useless customer service

"Very disappointed with Purolator. I dropped a small parcel off at the Purolator depot in Port Hardy for delivery to Campbell River on a wednesday, did a track of the parcel and says in transit and will be delivered on Monday. The girl assured me it would get delivered on Friday. And yes I know that all shipments from the north go to Nanaimo before out for deliver. Not acceptable. And the real cruncher it cost me $117 for 26 pounds in a small box. Very unhappy customer."

This company as a whole is absolute complete trash. I have a no signature required sticker on my front door. For the 2nd day in a row now they have left a note saying I can pick my parcel up at depot which is 30 min from my home. I called and it’s the exact same useless experience. I can’t stay home to wait for a parcel to show up and sign hence the sticker on my door. Trash trash trash. So done with everything to do with purolator!!!!

Honestly I am only giving a one star because there is no option for a zero star. This company is a joke and I can’t believe that they are still in business in a developed country like Canada! First they lie about not finding a client’s address. Then they lied about “receiver (being) unavailable” when I was at home the entire time yesterday when they attempted to deliver my order. We share our phone number for a bloody reason and they didn’t even try to call my phone number for directions or for a buzzer to let them into my Apt building. Now they want me to go to their specified location to get the order myself. Meanwhile they didn’t bother to leave a notice at my building. I had to call Best Buy to find that out and get the directions. It is a shame the shipping company exists and they keep getting business from good companies like Best Buy. I will never recommend it to anyone!!!

Exceedingly poor service. No delivery of package to my home. Email sent saying to pick package up at their location 20 minutes drive from my home. No attempt at delivery. Complained when I picked the package up. I was told at this pickup location I should display my address on public road at the bottom of a road leading to my home. Really?! Not my property to put up an address sign. Girl at the desk then shrugged her shoulders and smiled saying that's the way it goes. Didn't care at all!! Other courier services deliver to my home without any problem. Seems to me the drivers doing delivery for Purolator are too lazy and can't be bothered doing their job as other companies are capable of doing. I would NEVER use Purolator. I will be complaining to the company I ordered my products from about Purolator's lack of service.
Purolator is very poor. Parcel was picked up on Jan 30 and seven days later it is not in transit. What a lousy shipping experience. Any online orders I make I will specifically request that the items be NOT shipped with purolator.
"They came up to my door in my apartment unit insTead of dropping it at the door, or leaving it with the reception, dropping it in 1-60 parcel boxes at the front they left me a notice to go pick it up. SO unreliable, no common sense and the worst shipper by a landslide."

Don’t even want to give it one star. Item was to be delivered on Friday. Waited never came. Then the update came and it said Tuesday. Took another day off. It never came. Spent three hours on the phone with Best Buy and a purolator supervisor on Tuesday night. They said it would not arrive. Even though tracking said it would. Now it’s Wednesday and the tracking has completely changed. Originally they showed it would be shipped from Langley over a week ago. Updated tracking shows it was never in Langley but Burnaby. And today they say they don’t have our street name. Why didn’t the supervisor say this last night?! They also said if we weren’t home I could pick it up somewhere. I weigh 100 pounds and it weighs 90. And I have a small car. So unwilling to help out and resolve this. Taking the morning off again but still no tv!!

"Waiting for a package since dec 2nd. They just won’t do anything with it. They’re not attempting delivery. They won’t update address. They won’t return it back to bell. My Christmas gift plan spoiled completely. Not even bell could get them to attempt delivery. I’ve been receiving packages to the same address for the past year and I see multiple purolator trucks coming by with packages. They just won’t bring mine for some reason. Their chat, phone and metro tracing is incompetent and cannot resolve anything. I don’t know if I’ll ever get my package delivered. Now amazon had sent one to purolator again. Have to contact and cancel it so they can ship through someone who can actually deliver.

Update: after getting my tracking number over email, Delphine confirmed that the package is not with purolator. It’s not back to bell either and it hasn’t been delivered to me. So they closed the case. Because apparently that’s a solution. Package not found and no proof of delivery so they’ll close the investigation. Very efficient process. Also my tracking page still says street number not found."

"First time they “ attempted delivery “ , they indicated that a buzzer code was not provided. So I quickly input the buzzer code into the required fields on their website and they indicated that it was updated. Days later the “ second attempt “ was made to deliver. My buzzer code was not used, rather a strange number was calling my cell. For the usual spam call reasons , I did not answer. Lo and behold it must have been Purolator because suddenly my delivery status changed from “ out for delivery “ to “ delivery attempted “ . I attempted to return the call immediately but it was unanswered and went to a random voice mailbox ( no obvious connection to Purplator) Absolute ineptitude. Based on previous experience, and the experience of thousands of others, I am shocked this company remains in business. Business owners , please do not use Purolator to ship your goods!!"

"I see all these reviews saying they messed up but then at least the customer service was good.
Haha! No. The only good customer service is never needing to contact customer service in the first place.

I think all of the Purolator drivers are stoned, because they're imagining ""weather conditions"" out of nowhere. Maybe they really haven't stuck their heads outside in 2 weeks and just have assumed the snow is falling endlessly. It's gone. Melted away by Dec 26th, do your job or quit this is not vacation time."
Good job the package was delivered one day ago
"Scheduled delivery on 28th of December (new year gifts for my family) was delayed till 29, then delayed till 30th. On 30th morning status was On vehicle for delivery. At 7pm they change the status to Weather delay, service will resume weather permitting. This is stupid as it’s been 4 days with +10+15 here in Burnaby.

My package from Vancouver to Burnaby. 4 days? Weather delay? It’s not even raining outside. No snow. Nothing!!! Lazy ass drivers !!!!"
"Just spoke for a 2nd time with purolator agent and supervisor. Very poor service. Supervisor hung up on call as she did not like the fact that I argued with her. Sweetie, as a supervisor that is your job to listen and resolve issues.

Package sent December 19th from Saskatchewan. Package arrived in Richmond, BC on dec 23rd. Spoke to purolator agent dec 28th as system said scheduled for delivery. Package never arrived...spoke to agent who assured package would arrive no later than Dec 30th. No package mid afternoon. Spoke to Agent and Supervisor on Dec 30th who now say no delivery. Earliest delivery date is January 3rd, 2023. Apparently, this is acceptable. Very poor service!! I advise use another company... I sent a package Dec 20th from New Westminster with FEDEX which arrived in Swift Current Saskatchewan on Dec 24. Again, do not use Purolator. Purolator providing no customer resolution. I hope you record your calls and can go back and listen. Very poor customer service by Supervisor. Hanging up to end call does not represent your company Purolator well.

A very dissatisfied Customer!!"

"Same here. Receiver unavailable - shipment scheduled for delivery next business day. I waited all day long. Waisted my entire day ! Now I have to wait 3 more days ! Shipped from Amazon. I am calling Amazon and telling them not to use Purolator in the future. They don't know what a working day is. You will never receive anything when they say it will
UPDATE ; 4 days later....I still don't have my item...this time they canceled at 5pm (like 4 days prior) that they can't deliver. I had to use the virtual assistant (which is smarter than any of them) to schedule a pick-up. I might as well go pick-up my parcel myself before they destroy it. Four days ago, they had me waiting on the telephone line for 2 hours ! It is such a useless company.
Don't be fooled by their reply below your comments. Emailing them is just going to be more of your time wasted. This is what they wrote to me after I emailed them; 'Thank you for contacting us and my apologies for the delays. It doesn’t look like the driver was able to make a delivery attempt today, my apologies. If the parcel is automatically rescheduled for delivery that is a good indicator that the driver was not able to make the attempt, as we do not typically automatically reschedule if an attempt was made'. See ? Clueless."
"While the online tracking tool is not the most accurate and the virtual assistant is useless, the customer service team is always professional and quick to provide support. My packages always arrive at the local pickup location on time or early."
"Ordered from a company that unfortunately chooses this crap service to deliver to homes. They divided the parcel in Two boxes and the first attempt occurs at 4pm with the lead parce.
Purolator guy sitting in the truck, while i went to take my shoes to receive the parcel he leaves without :
1. Knocking on the door,
2. leaving a card
Then takes more than one hour to get a hold of someone on the phone. They ask me if I want to re-schedule and it might take 1-2 days. Reschedule for what? so your driver can sit in the car and decide not to deliver again? Seriously last time I buy anything that ships from purolator. Already filed a complaint, and leaving a complaint through the company I bought the product. They tell me the second box might be still dropped off that day. Same thing happens with the second parcel, no knock on the door and no card but a nice Address correction required - receiver not found. Who trains this drivers? if they dont want to work fire them. I am now going to pick up the package myself since they are not even able to do a simple delivery."

I have a missing package, firstly the notifications are such a mess they send a message an hour after they deliver the package, I receive a message at 3:56pm and when I check in the platform all the actualized status it said delivered at 3:05pm. They told me that they delivered my package, but they do not have the proof of delivery (any photo) and now they are telling me that they are going to close my complaint because they have registered the item as delivered.
Don't use Purolator if you don't want to lose your money. They don't assume the responsibility of their lack of service."

Package is marked as Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable but I stayed at home and waited all day for the delivery truck and finally met him and said there were no packages coming to my address. did he lie? or why does the Purolator website pop up a message that there are no recipients of the delivery attempt?

"Joke of a company this is. Been expecting a package for the last 2 weeks, everyday it says it’s out for delivery, then at 4 pm the tracking is update to Status: “This shipment is delayed due to delay in transit” I have called everyday since and spoken to someone and left numerous message as I am ready to go pick it up but those messages are never read or missing in translation it seems.
Stay clear of this company, I would rather deal with the new up and coming courier companies. If I knew that my order was going to be delivered by purolator I would had shopped somewhere else.

The package was shipping from Richmond BC to New Westminister and it’s taken 2 weeks?"
"We received a note on our door saying that we should go to Repro Impression on Cote des Neiges in Montreal to pick up a package that we had not been home to receive. We went there in a snow storm during the hours indicated but there was a sign on their door that they would be closed for 3 days and that we should go to Express Shipping on Queen Mary to pick up packages. We went there in the dark and the snow only to find that the package would not be available there for several days. The fault lies with the original Purolator Note. Very Frustrating non-service! NOTE: We received a message from Purolator informing us that the package would be put out for delivery once again. However, after waiting a couple of days, we tried again to pick it up and were successful. The call from Purolator was appreciated but we could not continue to wait for another delivery. I have raised the star rating accounding.y"

"MY COMPANY HAS $40,000 worth of product that has been “misplaced” for a couple of weeks now. You have one job, get package and deliver package. (It really isn’t rocket science) The deal is likely going to fall through because of you morons. Suck my chode Purolator, I hope you go out of business and a company that can actually deliver packages takes over"
abosulte garbage of a shipping company. ordered a watch on nov 24th and they shipped it to the wrong city. my address does not even exist in that city. took me 6 weeks to get my money back. puolator did nothing but deflect the situation. i wouldnt trust these guys to ship dog crap to my worst enemy

"Zero is enough!!! The computer that I bought from Dell is at least 10 days here in Barnaby!!! They sent a part of shipment on 15 Dec! Then asked me to complete the address! I am wondering how the cable organizer has been shiped without unit number but not the complete PC????
I am calling via busy lines all the last week. At least make the address correct on 17th of December. It was mentioned that they will bring it before 8pm the last two dayssss and then nothing!!! I canceled everything sitting at home, waiting for them… Nothing happened. At 8, there is just a notice, sorry we are late!!!! Today, nothing happened. My son has lost birthday gift, and his holiday just waiting for his gaming system! This is not the first, but the worst!!!
Hate the service"

Hope amazon sends me a replacement, and if they do, its not to be delivered with this company again."
"Worst delivery service in Canada. Customer service works hard to make you feel like you are incompetent and blame you for simple errors on their end. If you are expecting a package from them, good luck!"

"I will stop buying anything from Bestbuy only because of Purolator, I have never seen a worse service provider.

This is very unprofessional and an act of scam."

"They dropped the ball on the first part of the delivery, but when I contact them, by phone, the customer service rep was very helpful to explain the situation and appreciative of my situation, passing on these views to the t""racing specialist for review"". The result was my package was delivered today! Great work on the service part."
"I ordered a vacuum cleaner directly from Dyson. As soon as it became apparent that they were using Purolator to ship it I knew that I was in for trouble. I included on the delivery instructions the intercom code to call upon arrival so I could let them in. I also signed up for SMS alerts to be told of their arrival. However the only 2 alerts I received today were: your package is out for delivery, then 2 hours later: Purolator was unable to deliver your package today. What a big surprise. No effort at all to try and deliver the package. I doubt very much whether they were even there. I sat by my phone waiting for the intercom call but nothing. Not a peep. Other delivery companies seem quite capable of calling it, but not Purolator. They also did not try to call my phone number either. I’m pretty sure now that they are saving costs and trying to get people to pickup the packages from their pickup locations. Or maybe the driver just didn’t want to get cold leaving his truck to venture forth to people’s houses. Either way, the service is an absolute joke and the sooner businesses stop using these lazy clowns for deliveries the better. Up your game Purolator or just give up and go flip burgers instead. You’re useless. Redelivery date 27th December. You’re having a laugh right? Why 6 days? To try and get me to pick it up? Totally unprofessional!!"
"If I could give a negative star I would. I ordered an item and the seller use purolator, Today is the delivery date(Dec 20,2022), for the whole day no one contacted me, buzz me or the management to get inside the lobby to deliver my package. Then 8:30pm I received a txt that my package is ready for pick up at one of purolator's offices. I track my package and it says ""delivery attempted"". Which I highly doubt they even attempt in the first place. I check the lobby, not even a sticker slip saying they were there. Nothing. Very bad service. I am very disappointed and frustrated. I search online and found out that purolator deliveries have a reputation of doing this. I can't even begin how angry I am right now. ugh."

"Unbelievably bad service. On the day after Purolator could not deliver a gift purchased at Electronics for Less, I called and arranged with them to hold the package at a nearby convenience store in Downtown Toronto. That was 11 days ago. I have had 3 chats with Purolator (wait time on the phone is insane) and repeated promises that the package will be taken to the pickup site soon. The chat agents tell me not to believe the status information on their website which since yesterday has said that the package is being returned to the sender. I know that this is holiday time but this is ridiculous. I have been doing business myself with UPS for over 20 years and never had anything like this at all - and the information on their site regarding tracking is almost always reliable. AVOID!!!!"

"BestBuy, PLEASE stop working with this company! They don’t deliver packages. The employees aren’t doing their job. They say it’s “out for delivery” and then suddenly by 6 PM it’s “delayed” and they do not deliver. FedEx and UPS are exactly the same. However, Canada Post always delivers packages every time, no hassle. Why is Purolator incapable of delivery? This company does not care.

Do not buy online. It’s just a convenience trap. Go to the store or pick up the item."

"The worst delivery service ever.
First of all - they never update your order tracking in the system on time. 2nd - they never call you or anything if the delivery is at your place and if they cannot deliver it. 3rd - deliveries are always late.

I had 2 orders from Amazon, 1st was getting delivered by Canada Post, and 2nd was getting delivered by Purolator (no idea why).
But the thing is both order had same delivery date. The order which was getting delivered by Canada post i got it before my delivery date. And the 2nd order which was getting delivered by Purolator they just keep updating that ""weather delay service will resume blah blah blah"" and by now it's already 1 week late and got update today it's again 1 day late. How the hell Purolator make excuses while i got my 1st order by Canada post in same weather condition.
It is always like that, Always late.
Worst Delivery Service Ever Ever."

I'm very disappointed doesn't even care about your parcel.

Do not waste time ordering at Bestbuy for delivery it is better to pick it up. Purolator very poor job!"

"When Purolator Breaks They Hit the Brakes. When Things Go Wrong They Remain Wrong! Purolator's Robot Agent runs in circles with a useless amalgam of cut and paste frustration. I spent hours entering my phone number and email and clarification efforts. No one will contact you. Real life agents are powerless to take any action or resolve simple problems. They will not hear you in spite of oversimplifying and over explaining. Agents are trained to only provide excuses and they do that with ease. My parcel sits in Kamloops this past week waiting for address clarification yet no one has initiated contact to clarify anything with me. Amazon has used Purolator to send ""Hundreds"" of items to me over the years. Now, a parcel from Best-Buy with, ""My exact same address,"" has permanently fallen off the rails. Things can not and will not be fixed! Your parcel silently stagnates."

Bunch of liars! They said they could not deliver because my walkway was full of snow. I had my driveway and walkway cleaned at 6 am. Been arguing with this crap company for a week. Now they are saying they cant deliver until next week. Package was due 4 days ago! Everyone needs to switch to Fed-ex or UPS or in my case canada post. Screw purolator.

"One star is being generous. Like the previous reviewer I have had a package delayed a number of days tagged with ""Weather delay"". Problem with the the company response to the previous review of there being a backlog, is the package was ""On vehicle for delivery"" but was never delivered. Recycling packages through the system is not helping the backlog, nor customer service. Now I have to wait another two days for attempted delivery, when the item was on the truck yesterday. What's even more frustrating is the package contains a computer that is bouncing around in the back of a truck all day and will be again until it finally gets delivered.

This company has a very serious management problem, with so many negative reviews. It would be extremely wise for management to wake up, study and actually address the problems being shared, rather than having frontline employees keep apologizing for poor performance, especially when these employees don't have the authority to fix anything and keep taking the heat from disgruntled customers.

Case in point, please don't apologize for this review and instead spend your valuable time providing this productive feedback to management, so the performance improves and in turn so do the ratings.

By the way, it is extremely insulting to read the the same apologies for the same problems over and over. I strongly suggest this company go to work and figure out how to change the processes and results for the positive. Hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears.

Update:
Appears to be an automated response. Good luck improving your performance and ratings based on customer feedback. LOL"

"It's not a Package, It's not a promise, It's a ^$%#^%$ JOKE! Despite being easily accessible and only 10 minutes away from the Urban center of North Vancouver Purolater won't deliver to my area because there isn't enough demand. There are about 100 houses in my area. I pointed out there isn't any demand because they won't deliver! I was awaiting car parts and had disassembled my car to install them. Not only were the parts late as they passed the buck around, I had to rebuild my car and though it wasn't safe to drive, drive it across town to pick up my package. Purolater doesn't care about you, or your package, They care about their own bottom line. It's not a promise , it's a bad joke! Pure ya later! (I only left a star because I had too)."

"This company is a JOKE!!!!
i ordered a jacket and the merchant used Purolator to ship the product. That took almost 2 weeks! I had to return the item as it was too big and re order a smaller size. The merchant provided a UPS ground return label to return the product. It took UPS 4 days from Toronto to Vancouver and item has been returned. Lets just say im still wating 2 weeks later for the replacement item LOL. Online tracking is crapola as it indicates weather delay but thats a LIE as UPS delivered product back in 4 days encountering the same weather as Purolator. When you call the reps are horrid and the management team reflects that. This was a personal shipment but since this ordeal I have changed my companies corporate accounts to a more reliable courier UPS & FED EX. I have also encouraged other merchants to do the same as customers wont buy our products based on this horrendous service."

Purolator is TERRIBLE. We created shipping labels on Thursday and today is TUESDAY and they haven't picked up our packages since then. The warehouse is charging us $40 storage each day. I called and spoke to 4 people who kept transferring me to different people. Each of them keep saying something different - no one leaves notes on the account so the next person knows what is happening. Fix your system. One person created a pick up and it was rejected and we were not notified about it. This is becoming a waste of time. If they don't pick it up today we are not using Purolator for our business again.

"Package has been sitting in Ontario since it was picked up on the 5th of December, On the expected delivery date the first update since the 5th was added and it was the typical ""weather disruption"" status on my tracking. The other package that was ordered along with this item has been delivered and moved through the Ontario Sorting facility at the exact same time as this package so the ""weather disruption"" is of questionable validity. furthermore my packages from other carriers have moved through the same area with zero problem all weekend (Dec 9-11 2022). I will never ship with Purolator again, I placed this order with the selected time frame due to my NEED to have it before for gifts before I leave the province for 2 weeks to attend Christmas. Contacted customer service.....and as with others I have had ZERO headway made."

"Purolator does not even attempt deliveries. Never use them for anything.
First my package was ""delayed due to weather"" when it was clear out, then the driver did not even attempt a delivery or leave a note (the concierge in the building sits right by the front door and saw the guy did not get out of his truck. Then once I called the customer service they told me there's nothing they can do but I can come pickup the package 2 hours away by bus or they can reattempt delivery in 4 days.
I hate when I see anything is being delivered by purolator, they are the only company that has a 100% failure rate on deliveries in my experience."

"Id give them zero stars if I could. Horrible delivery service. I gave them all my delivery and contact information and was home all day, and was still met with the infamous ""Sorry we missed you"" tag.

Just heard they've become ""exclusive partners"" with Best Buy. Never making a purchase there again, or any business that uses Purolator as their courier. Never.

Looking forward to the stock copy-paste response from their underpaid social media intern!"
"4 items were shipped from Ontario to Edmonton from retailer to my business address. Tracking revealed all items landed in Edmonton within 3 days. Tracking after that was inconsistent. On truck - out for delivery. Received one package 2 days later. Tracking revealed weather delay, expected date of delivery - unavailable.
2 other packages arrive 4 days later, 4th package lost.
Case opened, information re package provided by me and shipper to Purolator including pictures to aid in locating last item.
Purolator, please consider the following perceptions in order to improve your processes.
Automated chat help seems to be just a tool to pacify end receivers and not accomplish or initiate any actions to solve issue or provide transparent information. Agent communication can provide no more information than automated system, also perceived as pacification tool.
Honest, transparent information whether good or bad will go a long way in working with you and understanding issues that may arise. Blanket excuses just aggravate the situation.
Tracing specialist requesting pictures, value, description, serial number of item to aid in locating item does not instill confidence, one would assume your own shipping label would suffice. Employees of Purolator must be very frustrated or experience high anxiety. Does Purolator solicit ideas from their front line workers on how to improve certain processes? They usually have the best ideas to streamline and improve their tasks. I believe Purolator employees generally care and take pride in their work, but may be blocked by some corporate policies or processes that inhibit the betterment of service. Every business have their challenges, but the perception as witnessed by this site; as mine, that Purolator is unwilling to improve."

not only did they fail to deliver the item
they make it sound like I was the one that was not available to receive the item.
i already gave all the information needed like security codes for the main entrance yet they still FAILED to finish the delivery.

Why does anyone use Purolator?"
"Purolator offers the worst delivery service hands down! What they provide isn’t a delivery service when you have to pick up the item at one of their outlets. It never fails that the driver pulls up to my gate & puts a ‘sorry, we missed you’ tag in my flyer box period! The driver never attempts to open the gate & walk the parcel to my clearly visible door. The app is equally as useless because preferences are ignored & I only receive delivery alerts AFTER the driver has pulled away. I’ve placed several complaints with customer service about this lousy service & nothing has changed. I complained about this exact same situation only 3 weeks ago & had the same zero delivery attempt from Purolator again today. This type of lousy service really negatively affects those that depend on door to door delivery because of age, health, mobility issues etc. Too bad no one at Purolator seems to care enough to do their job professionally or at all. I’m starting to wonder if they have parcels in their trucks to deliver or do they just drive around with delivery attempt cards?! SMH"

"Still waiting for a response after 2 separate promises that I would be contacted by email in the last 2 days.

4 days of “weather delay”. 1 was believable, the 3 after were fine. Then suddenly changed to “damage reported - please contact”. 10 minutes on chat yesterday, first unfulfilled promise.

Today 20 minutes in phone queue, call suddenly dropped.

10 Minutes on chat, promise to direct me to an agent. Chat has been open for over 4 hours, no agent.

Complained on Twitter, request to DM followed by second unfulfilled promise.

4 hours since, still not contact from Depot.

Still have to deal with the damage when the mythical contact occurs."

The Purolator driver said he knocked on my door and know one was home. Which on that day there was multiple people home. And the driver also said he put a letter on the door and yet there was no letter on the door. Now my kids don't have there snow stuff in the middle of winter because of the driver.

"Ordered two items from a vendor Nov 28th. Items shipped separately both through purolator. Expensive items , tracked shipping . Both picked up and scanned into Montreal sort facility , headed to Alberta .
Expected delivery date December 6 and 7th , no update on tracking until today .
Today I see the item that should have been delivered today is delayed due to weather. Now it is in Mississauga, ON with an expected delivery date of tomorrow . Other item never updated , but willing to bet both will be delayed tomorrow.
If you are going to offer tracking and expected delivery dates more effort would be nice . It does not take a week to move an item from Montreal to Mississauga ."
"Ordered an expensive laptop for my wife through Amazon during Black Friday sale. Tracking shows it is located at purolator sorting facility in Etobicoke, ON since Nov 27th. Well it’s end of day Dec 6th and still hasn’t even left the facility. Purolator claimed a BS weather delay excuse which I confirmed with Purolator in Brandon mb, was a false claim. The problem is the facility efficiency as explained to me by the Brandon worker. Sent complaint to Amazon. Also asked them never to use Purolator again for any future purchases through Amazon."
Nothing more than complete incompetence !

"WoW
After reading all these reviews, it gives me a little comfort that I am not alone with dealing with PUROLATOR. I'm not even to begin to share the BS they put me thru. One would think, that after receiving so many bad reviews, they may try to correct their problems. My package FINALLY arrived, and I had to explain to the driver what to do, as he cried its his FIRST WEEK WORKING. Wasn't he supposed to take my REQUEST FOR SNR? Unfortunately, I had to tell the company I purchased my item from, that I will no longer buy from them until they change their carrier."
"They did a false delivery attempt. I am home 24/7, they haven't buzzed
my apartment, not knocked if they got in nor called. No paper left neither. Customer service is not helpful and slightly rude."

"It took over a week of daily emails telling me that it was in transit and the an hour later telling me that the package could not be delivered because the receiver was unavailable to receive it. This was not the case at all. There was always someone available at the time they ""tried"" to deliver it. Not one purolator truck went by during the time they stated they were there. TERRIBLE delivery service. Very unreliable."
"Started last summer. While camping my brother forgot meds he needed. No problem, a friend couriered to our campsite. Never made it in over a week there. Today I am waiting for a package. It shipped November 28th. As of December 6th it has only just left sorting facility in Mississauga. No update since the 28th. How do they stay in business? Wish my vendor did not opt to use them."

"What is it called - the ""service"" of the world's leading country?

It's not the first time I've come across something like this. The delivery service does not fit up to its word.

The package was supposed to be delivered tomorrow but it was delivered without warning today when I was not home!

Now I have to go to somewhere for the parcel, because some stupid man didn't deliver on the specified day + he even didn't think to write an SMS or call me! Also, if no one is home, the package should have been left at the front door, so why didn't you?

I don't pay for delivery in order to go 20-30 km away to pick up a parcel myself.

Close your awful service and stop annoying people!"

"I've never had a package delivered by Purolator -- I always have to go pick it up at some inconvenient location. This time, they 'tried to deliver' and sent it a 2.5 hour round-trip (I don't have a car) transit adventure away to sit there for five days. Nobody left a note, emailed me, msg'd me, or contacted me in any way. The only reason I knew it was there was because I checked the original email from Dell and drilled down three levels of tracking. At first I couldn't believe it was real, as it's so incredibly stupid -- then I remembered it was Purolator. Utterly useless company. Dell sucks for shipping with them too."

"What a joke. Waiting for a package that's in their warehouse situated a 2 hr drive from me. It's been there for 5 days abd they're telling me it's a weather related delay. It's not the delay I so much mind, it's the absolute crap and lies they provide as an excuse. The entire region has seen a half hour of rain last 5 days, otherwise it's been sunny. At least own up to your inadequate service and stop spewing obvious lies."

"THE WORST!!!!!!! I banned them on Amazon already for how awful all the experience with them is. Packages always late, lost or they refuse to deliver after faking a delivery attempt. Customer service helps nothing at all. This late package has been lost for a whole month, no explanations, ghosting me, then telling me is on it's way, lying about attempting a delivery, then refusing to bring it again, top of that they had all my info, so no excuse!
Do not use this company!!!! is complete chaos and HELL!!!!!"

"Do you know that feeling of being so uterly frustrated and upset as a consumer? You almost cant even put into words the dismay you feel about a company and how it continues to exist as a business? Purolator is the company that is at the top of my list. I concur with ALL the concerns and complaints written here. And then the generic responses in these posts from Purolator to apologize and to provide tracking # is an arrogant shameful spin on it. In my countless cases after moving to my new residence two years ago, when Purolator is the carrier provided after ordering something , they will text me that my item is ready to pickup and will be held for five days. I am 50 yes 50 kilometers from the hub to go pick it up(100 k there and back) I am not in the sticks, they just tell you your postal code is not in our delivery service area?? All other companies along with Canada Post deliver to my home or in CP case a lockbox on my street. Every company except Purolator. They should not then accept item from the business(i.e. Sportchek, amazon or any company) if they can not fullfill contract. Its wrong!? These businesses assume that the customer is receiving their item but they are not..and Purolator still gets paid as if they have delivered it?! At least third party it to a company that can get it done if its not in your delivery area. To send out a text to say gleefully that your parcel is ready for pickup is nothing short of an insult. A consumer is paying for home delivery and the business is thinking that Purolator is honouring it. Its shamefull and should not be tolerated. Business to business they are great I am sure but business to home..complete fail and bust. I actually have been successful in having them dropped as a carrier with Amazon. It was a bit of work with Amazon managers over the phone but you can do it. I have had many calls with Purolator reps along with the employees at hubs after you stand in line to pickup your undelivered item. They all have heard it before and I actually receive empathetic responses. I feel for these employeees that are on the front line receiving the frustration and the complaints, and having to endure stories of long drives on snowy roads to come fetch an item that should be delivered? I become my own courier! And does a manager ever phone back to discuss your concerns..how about never. Honestly someone in upper management with this company or their parent company Canada Post need to take these complaints seriously . The complete lack of any understanding at the magnitude of customers frustratation should not be ignored. These real problems and delivery failures need to be addressed and corrected by Purolator. Best case is to just stop providing home(or lack of) delivery. Move over and let other capable companies provide the customer service and delivery on the so many deliveries you seem to neglect or not honour for one reason or another. Listen and act! Thanks..
""Followup"" Thanks for the response Vanessa from Purolator relations but I have to disagree with you. I have been told by these businesses that when they apply my postal code the list of carriers presents itself to the shipping warehouse. Purolator comes up as a deliverable address so the shipper can choose Purolator from the list of carriers and then print a waybill for pickup. Thats wrong! Purolator has no right or reason to accept a postal code address it has no intention to deliver to. It should default out so shipper can choose another carrier. Surely your system does not accept every postal code in Canada as deliverable when thats not the case?? That really would be deceitful I think. To add even more frustration to the client when they find out their package is undeliverable, the Purolator hub and pickup points are only opened weekdays until five..closed weekends!? Thats just insult to injury when people are at school, work and maybe can not get into these pickup locations until later in the day or until a Saturday. And how about inclement weather or severe road conditions? Some may not drive or be a long distance away from these hubs. That is why a courier company is in the business is it not? To get deliveries to people who need it. Can you imagine Purolator telling a business or corporation that they have to drive to a hub to pick up their items? Thats funny right..not really! It wouldnt happen. Stick to business to business deliveries and get out of home deliveries you can not seem to consistently fullfill. Then possibly Purolator relations would not have to defend this avalanche of one star reviews and customer complaints. Which in a nutshell is shameful of even trying to defend in the firstplace. Thanks Vanessa."
"Hi Paul, thank you for taking the time to write this review. We can suggest when ordering anything online that you advise your senders to use another courier that services your area.

"Once again(or shall I say, every time something is delivered from Purolator) a delivery driver from Purolator claims he/she tried to deliver my parcel.
( I live in Ajax, ON)

Delivery attempted.
PICKERING, ON CA,
Delivery attempted today at 4:10 PM
Unfortunately, Purolator ran into an issue when attempting your delivery.

Funny how this always happens with Purolator. I sit at home all day with both front(my window is right at the front door) and back door propped open to my building, and again no attempted delivery.

Now I have to wait till Monday or Tuesday to receive my parcel which when I ordered it I specifically ordered it knowing it would be delivered this weekend, when I would be home to receive it.

Purolator why do you let your drivers get away with this?!?"

"Re. PIN # 333863018813
Received email notice that package delivered today @ 10:09 am, but nothing found at the front door or around the property shortly after apparent delivery . I was home all morning did not see or hear courier. I checked with neighbours in the event it was delivered to wrong house and checked around property. I attempted to lodge complaint using both chat & telephone (after waiting 45 min). I asked that driver be contacted to determine where package delivered (what part of the street because I live in the country and it would narrow my search). I was told my complaint was being forwarded and I would be contacted. So far, no email confirmation of my complaint or call from customer service. I’m still waiting…

Update: It took me a day but I found it had been delivered to a neighbour down the street… still no follow up from Purolator. I guess they forgot about me."

"These guys are in the business of delivering packages, only they don't know how to deliver packages. The latest farce from purolator, after ordering an item on amazon, it was stuck in purolator warehouse for 2 weeks only to be cancelled because ""the item is too heavy"". Are you kidding me? This company deserves to go bankrupt. Now let's wait and see the ""CANNED"" response from purolator from Vanessa, their social media ""expert"" asking me to do their legwork to find their package. FU Purolator, I'll just cancel the order and you can ship the package back to the vendor in one of your rusty trucks.

EDIT .. LOL - look below. I even got the name ""Vanessa"" right. so predictable. garbage company."

"This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I signed up for email and SMS updates, didn't get any. Then they showed up when I wasn't home and dropped off the package at their warehouse. I requested a redelivery for another day when I was expecting another package from them. Waited hours only to be told that neither package was going to be delivered. Then got kicked off the chat, no updates on when either package will be sent. I'll be leaving the country in a couple days and most likely I'll have to cancel my orders because of this. No one will be home to collect. And they are providing no assistance. What a nightmare.
UPDATE: I had to cancel both orders. I will never order from a company that uses this shipper ever again. Amazon, FedEx and DHL have all offered smooth service and delivery. I am totally baffled by this experience. I never want to deal with this company again!"

"Ordered a super small package (1lb?) from Bell in Mississauga, a 45 minute drive from my home. Ordered Nov 28th, Bell assumed it would arrive the next day, it took 5+ days due to missed connection delays (I assume, its still not here, hoping its here tomorrow which would be 5 days). Amazon gets this done in less than one day. Why do we use these places when they're so poor at their job but Amazon could deliver a treadmill in one day vs 4 days for a 1lb package 45 minute drive.

"BEWARE! PUROLATOR WILL TRAUMATIZE YOU. Before you shop online, ask the merchant if they partner with Purolator, if they say ""yes"" DO NOT BUY!. Purolator will traumatized you. Dealing with Purolator is a health hazard.
Whether you live in an apartment building or a detached house, Purolator doesn't ring bells, they don't knock, they wont call you, they wont text you, they wont buzz you, they WILL stick a note to your door and driveway even when you are right there in your home. From what I have read here, and going by my own experience today 1/12/2022, Purolator drivers ARE NOT interested in actually delivering your package. You could be right there at your front door and they will walk past you and stick a paper on your door claiming that you were not home. These people have ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY!.

It seems that the longer items stay in Purolator warehouses, the more Purolator gets paid, that seems to be the motivation behind their zero commitment to actually delivering packages to customers. Or do their drivers get paid based on how many packages they do not deliver?

Any merchant that partners with Purolater is hurting its customer base.

I spent about an hour today on the phone with a Purolator agent who said to me ""our drivers are not phone operators..."" (sic) as she justified why the driver stock a paper to the front door of my building (while I was home) and drove away instead of alerting me. The lady claimed Purolator drivers do not have company phones. Purolator has a serious problem of non-commitment to customers.
PUROLATOR SUCKS OUT THE JOY FROM YOUR BUYING EXPERIENCE and leave you with painful memories.

Purolator is paid to communicate with the house not with clients and so they stick papers on walls and doors and drive away. They will never ring your bell or knock at your door. They are allergic to having any human contact with customers.

Today Marks my third painful experience with Purolator. NEVER AGAIN WILL I FAIL TO ASK ONLINE MERCHANTS WHO THEY COURIER IS, BEFORE I SHOP.

Purolator does not deliver items, they deliver PAIN.
BEWARE!!"

"This company is so bad. I bought a pair of snow boots with Columbia. I was expecting them on 29 Nov and they did not come because of the snow which I can understand. Then, I registered for notification service. It said they will come on 30 Nov, but without contacting me whatsoever and said could not enter the building. All UPS, FedEx know they can find my name in the directory to access. They did not even notify me for the fail in delivery. I checked it out myself by tracking my delivery. They are certainly the worst courier I have ever seen. Now the road is so slippery and I have no snow boots to wear. I told my husband about it and he said he cancelled an order with Amazon because of Purolator's delivery. I would never made that order if I knew they are using Purolator in this order. Guess what? They even charged me $7 for delivery. After complained about it to Columbia, they said they will refund the delivery to me. But I want my snow boots......"

Worst company for delivery! My package has been delayed in Vancouver for 3 days no its suppose to deliver today now he's saying possibly next week. I could drive to Vancouver and pick it up before it would ever get delivered to my house.

"A company that charges shipper unauthorized address correction fees.
Fedex and UPS will return packages sent to wrong addresses or if it is undeliverable but Purolator will bill the shipper without getting verification. How is it the shipper's fault if a customer want their shipment delivered to a different address. If you run an ecommerce store, be careful you are better off with Fedex, UPS or Canada Post.
This fraudulent Purolator has been charging our company $17.52 per shipment anytime a customer want their package delivered to a different address.
Why must a shipper pay if customer want their product delivered to a different address that is different from what they put in their online order.

If you run a shopify store, stay the hell away from Purolator. Be warned.
We are contacting our lawyer to battle these barrages of unauthorized address correction charges that Purolator Charged us.

Thanks to Fedex, UPS and Canada Post for always returning our shipment without fraudulently charging us unauthorized address correction charges."

"Purolator should close down. It’s an absolute disgrace to call this a “delivery” company when 90% of the time you have to drive to their warehouse.
They don’t knock at your door but will claim they stopped, they won’t update the tracking, they delay packages ONLY because they driver is too lazy to pick up a box that is heavier than 10LBS.
Shame on Canada Post for keeping this waste of a company alive"
"I waited home the entire day for my delivery then I get a text saying that there was a missed delivery. No one knocked at my door even left a door knocker. Waited 2 hours on the phone the first day then almost 2 hours the second day, wasting my time. When the phone was finally answered the CSR starting making excuses. I asked to speak to manager, Katelyn who had the audacity to tell me that it is up the drivers discretion if to leave a door knocker or not( if there is a driver}that is a blatant lie! They refuse to take responsibility for their actions and want me to wait at home another day when i have other things to take care of or pick it up(doing what they are paid for) What they didn't know i worked for their competitor for 22 years and I know how the correct process is!"

Try to train your courier to put any package/s in a dry place portion not in a wet portion
"Ordered a package through Best Buy, to unfortunately find out they use Puro-way-later. they accept the package the day after it was ordered on the 25th at 4:12pm and then received not a single update since until today the estimated delivery date, to see ""address correction required"". Now I currently reside in the town of Mundare, it has about 850 people and ONE POST OFFICE.....so. I tried to use the live(bot) chat to remedy the address issue, I use the address locator to find the PO box, sure enough it pops up right as rain....I'm told it cannot find the address, the one that popped up automatically after putting in Mundare AB. Glad to know that they both know and do not know where to deliver at the same time....makes sense. Have now been on hold for over an hour, trying to tell the ""Delivery Company"" that either can't find an entire town or the only Post Office in it, how to find them. This would be a hilariously comedic situation if it was not happening to me. How do these guys stay in business?

Edit: finally got a hold took well over an hour, so neither best buy nor Purolator thought to mention that a PO box, which is used for deliveries from everywhere else does not work for Purolator, until the delivery day in the evening.... three separate points where they could have let me know. when ordered, when shipped and when it was brought to the sorting facility. the label gets looked at those 3 times. and no one went, Purolator cannot not deliver to PO boxes, we should inform them. Fingers crossed it gets here asap as informed, but have my doubts"

"Yet another experience with that service-less company.
Same as always, they show up unannounced, I'M not in, so they rush to drop the parcel to some place kms away from home ... but that place only opens during business hours !! and of course they are closed during weekend. how stupid is that ? Meaning that if I'm at work and can't receive the delivery, I'M also at work when that place is open, so ... what purolator does, is to rush to drop the parcel out of their hands, so they can label the parcel as ""delivered"" and get it out of their responsibility without doing what they get paid for !
Everytime I see purolator, (sms, email) my first reaction is: Oh nooooo not again."

"I will avoid any company that ships with Purolator. They lie about attempted deliveries like any other shipping company but then have the gall to expect me to pick up my package in a location that is farther away from both me and the store I ordered from.

What kind of business model is that for a logistic company?! I don't have sympathies that there is a higher volume of packages, that should make you happy since that is your freaking business. Maybe you should pay your workers better and hire more instead of expecting us to be sorry for you.

The support chat is horrible and a huge waste of time. Every time I get connected to an agent the chat will just crash, disappear, slow down my browser tab. I've tried this three times now

"This company is the only one that doesn't deliver to my door, and I have to drive 30km to pick up parcels. I don't think I've ever received anything on time, and about 50% of the time my items go missing, so I have to contact Amazon and get a refund then reorder. I now set my delivery address to my local post office if my orders are important or time sensitive just in case they want to use Purolator. I've actually requested through Amazon's customer service that they never use Purolator again for any of my orders. We'll see how that goes."
"Despite giving explicit instructions for delivery at the address with intercom code, no use of the intercom was made and they claim “unsuccessful delivery, receiver unavailable”. This is fraud, accepting payment ($50 in this case) to carry out a service and then never carrying out the service. Now i have to get in my car and go to their depot, miles away to make up for their laziness. Don't use Purolator, unless you want an expensive and incomplete service."

Purolator has the worst tracking which is probably why the delivery service is so bad. As soon as they pick up the item they let you know it will be delayed and then they don’t update the tracking. My parcel is taking longer to get from Vancouver to Victoria than it did to cross the country. Very unreliable company.

My package was delivered to Walmart shipping department and obviously I do not live there. The address was completely wrong. The only way they realized something was wrong is when I contacted them and told them. It was sorted out surprisingly pretty quick. The driver who delivered it told me that he delivered it to the wrong place. He was shocked and surprised when I said I knew and I was the one who reported the issue. He was confused how I would know. I had to explain the tracking system to him. Why do people keep using a shipping company that does not deliver to the correct house.

"So where is my pkg? It was picked up in Ontario Nov 16, and has been sitting at the National Hub since that date (past 10 days) Purolator states weather delay. Curious enough, FedEx picked up a pkg on Nov 16, same location and had no problem delivering it to my door in Edmonton by Nov 19th. So what is this magical weather delay that Purolator has experienced that has prevented them from doing their job? Considering you have a fancy new sort facility in Ontario, a few snow flurries shouldn't impact this company. When can I expect my pkg?
Update today Nov 26, Purolator has assigned a new tracking number to my package and changed the issue from weather delay to delivery delay. New tracking number is obviously not a Putolator number, so who has my package been passed off to? Would like an answer but wait time to speak to an agent is over an hour!!! Worst customer service ever!"
Our company paid for express post to deliver a cheque the next day to a company our business is purchasing merchandise from. Purolator “its a promise” was to deliver by 5pm the next day. Two days later they haven’t even attempted to delivered. Now it is Friday and the business is closed. This is the 3rd time Purolator has messes up delivery to this company and is ruining our business relationships. When called and chatted with ‘Emily’ I asked her to put a note to ensure the package got delivered Monday. She told me if she did that it would most likely delay the package further. Say ‘what’. Absolutely unacceptable for a company owned by the government.

"yet ANOTHER crap experience with purolator. i have no idea why this company is still in business. they came to the building and left a notice on the outside door. i had no idea they had been here. they did not use the enterphone and the tracking number is illegible. so tracking was not possible. trying to get them on the phone is an exercise in futility. forget it. now the package is in a place far off location that i can't get to because it is not on a bus route and i don't drive. the shoes will be returned to Sorel. i wish there was some way of knowing which delivery service that stores use. if i knew, i would never have bought shoes from Sorel."

"This is the WORST company in Canada to get something ""delivered"". In fact if you want to be sure NOT to receive your package, ask them. They are great at it. I ordered computer stuff from a Canadian company in Ontario. Was scheduled for a wednesday. I ordered the thing on a SATURDAY. So a whole 4days for a delivery. Which is incredibly long when it should take 2 days. On wednesday the driver lied and said i wasnt available for the delivery. I work from home and was receiving all the other parts of my computer from amazon. I had to call customer service. Get my things delivered to a counter near my location. They told me my stuff would be there. Keep in mind i am handicapped and cannot move as i wish. Thats why i PAID for a delivery. I was willing to go there and pick up myself instead of getting a delivery. Next morning i receive a text to go pick my thing up. I go there. My stuff isn't there. They picked it up and brought it back to a terminal. And i now have to wait until MONDAY, because they don't deliver in the week end. I paid EXTRA to make sure i get my thing on time. No customer service. Zero problem resolution. Employee hide behing procedure. No one cares. Drivers are kids who dont want to work. Do yourself a favor. Use CANADA POST. They are reliable. This company is litterally garbage."

I was home with the door a bit opened. Also with a dog that always barks when someone opens the front gate and walks up to knock. But nothing happened. I then get a text for missed delivery and ran to go outside to see if i could catch him but nope. Then I went to the mail box to find a note checked off for no one home!

"I had expected a delivery from Rogers today. At 5:43 pm I received a text saying Attempted delivery- receiver unavailable. My driveway and house lights was on the whole time and the driver claimed we’re not home. Fortunately for me I have a doorbell and a driveway camera that always recording. When looking at the footage it shows the driver pulled up on my driveway at 5:42 pm, sat there for 1 minutes and drove away. The driver never even opened the door to get out of the car. I have to spend another 1 hour and 20 minutes to get through to customer service to file a complaint. I hope Puroltor will compensate for my inconvenience but I highly doubtful that will happen. I didn’t know that this is a common practice with Purolator’s drivers based on all this similar negative reviews. I will never used Purolator for any of my personal delivery.

"I wish there was an option of delivery services, because I would make sure to avoid Purolator at all costs. My fourth time having them as my courrier, of course, for something expensive and important. I don't have a vehicle, to start off with, so I get things for delivery very often. Not one other company does me as wrong as Purolator; they didn't buzz my apt when they 'attempted' a delivery, nor did they use my phone number to call me and tell me they were downstairs, not even any SMS notifications (which I was subscribed to). They 'attempted' to drop it off, and now I have 5 days to pick it up 1h30min away from my house. How am I supposed to collect my items? Worse service than a McDonald's drive through."
I was waiting at home while the day but it says the receiver is unavailable. I am pretty sure no driver came. The best I can do is wait for the package to return and ask the seller to ship it again with another company.

I was home whole day and I never saw their truck entering the building.

YOU GUYS SUCK!
- CARELESS delivery guys
- RUDE customer service
- LAZY dispatcher, you all suck
Not sure if you are doing this on purpose??
Or not getting enough pay and throw all frustrations on CUSTOMER???

Purolator have the image of being the most crap company in Canada.
I'm seriously disappointed with this at a level to disregard this company for good for lying and false obligations and accusations of not being home??

The pain a customer have to go through to get their package delivered is unimaginable.

"I am waiting right now for an item to be delivered but tracking starts with picked up and not another post. Says delivery today but I am betting on Purolator saying something like they tried or weather was bad....😳. Where...is...it? The item originally was posted as coming last Friday.
I've told Amazon multiple times not to use Purolator. But they do . I'll cancel next time they do!
Item never arrived. Amazon hasn't figured out where it is. Obviously Purolator doesn't.
Delphine i sent my tracking number. I'm still waiting. Day 12 waiting and no idea when or if. Sad performance Purolator!"
"I had been tracking the package for the whole day and there was no doorbell/no knocking (nor any kind of notifications that it has arrived???)and then your delivery person left the slip saying that I'll have to go pick up the package myself. I'm really upset about this as it was an expensive package, the company failed to deliver it to me and requested that I go pick it up myself.

I called their customer service about this issue and the agent was not helpful at all. He told me I only had the choice to have it rescheduled for the next week when it was supposed to be delivered to me today.

If I had a choice, I would never ever choose this company to delivery my packages. Huge disappointment, worst service and customer service."

"3rd time my package was ""out for delivery"" but wasn't delivered for 3 days. What is this crap?
I now ask the business I'm ordering from who's delivering my product, if they say Purolator, I cancel the order."
"This is the worst service available, they don't knock, they don't ring, they just distribute slips of papers saying that no one was home when we all work from home. They don't care and so shouldn't you. Avoid them at all cost, I'll just cancel my orders going forward instead when I see their name."
"There is a reception in my house accepting all the packages but no, Purolator is special and no way they can just deliver things like normal people. I had to parcels with them in the past months and both times I received a call which lasted for 3-4 seconds, I had no chance to pick that up. First time I assumed it was some scam, I would not give a call back to some random number especially if they dropped the call. Second time I called back and nobody picked up. Then I was notified that I missed the delivery attempt. Which delivery attempt, I ask you? The one that never happend? Seems to me that the carriers just don't want to do their job."

"I'd like to complain about one delivery for something that I bought at Amazon.

It seems that your drivers did not follow the instructions that I added in Amazon or they don't know how to buzz an apartment building. They said in the report that "" Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"", but I was at home all the time (since I work from home) and the buzz connect directly to my phone (I tried to do the same process and it worked), and the phone didn't ring one single time, even though they said they tried. I had other deliveries from Amazon, and Purolator was surprisingly the only one that could not call/buzz me.

Also, when I called yesterday, the support in Purolator told me to add my email to track the delivery but this doesn't seem to work, since I received an email at 9am today about the attempt to deliver the order, but it seems that no temptation was made today...

I just want to also add that if the only option to deliver something bought from Amazon is this company, I won't buy there anymore. And I already mentioned it to Amazon itself.

I won't recommend this service to anybody."

"I would give this a zero star if it was possible, I wanted to order shipping supplies and I gladly waited in queue for customer service. I knew I would be waiting for awhile since the prerecorded messages already stated that it would be more than 10 mins. But at 4:59pm after waiting for over 30mins, someone picked up the call in which I heard a plentiful of people (I’m assuming are worker) talking in the background but not directly into the phone. Then after hearing some people mumbling in the in the background of the open phone call, they just ended my call without stating anything."

"I do not usual bother leaving negative reviews. Purolator however is on a completely different level of terrible. Without exaggeration, this is the worst courier service I've ever dealt with by far. Every single time I order (usually from Best Buy), the courier doesn't even bother coming anywhere near my house. I never even get a missed delivery notice. On the tracking app however, they always say that the receiver wasn't available, even though I was at home the whole day! I've already filed a complaint a few months ago, and the problem still persists. Additionally, the phone agent did confirm that the courier never was in the vicinity of my house (using the GPS tracker). I am going to stop buying from stores that ship via Purolator. What is the point of a delivery service if I need to go to the pick-up which is more that 20 minutes away during my busy work week?"

"Package in the beginning went missing, the store said Purolator picked it up a day ago but the Purolator website showed they didnt pick it up yet, the store opened investigation and the Purolator assigned a tracer after I was advised to call the store by the store website rep so I called the store. The Purolator told me they had issues with their website after I contacted them on Twitter and that they issued a ticket and will be looking in resolving this as soon as possible. The package appeared on Purolator website again and showed to be picked up and in transit and about to be delivered today and it was delivered even though over the chat today Purolator rep told me they are still investigating. So my advice is keep faith and follow up right away if something doesnt seem right. I am very glad my package didnt get lost and was delivered. So I am happy with a positive ending.
PS. Having trouble saving date of experience, package was delivered today 10 of November 2022. Also I wanted to add that Purolator rep on Twitter was very helpful, understanding and reassuring, her name was Nicole and I really appreciate it."
"If there was an option to give this company zero stars I would! The most illogical terms and conditions I have ever experienced when it comes to a POD (proof of delivery) signature, and I have a background in logistics so I understand the process. They also contradict themselves and presume to own your property (shipment) by deciding what they are going to do with it. Absolutely disgusting!!! When dealing with customer service to resolve the issue the conversation went in circles for 20 minutes. This is not a company that can think outside the box to improve customer service. Dealing with them is like speaking to a bunch of dumb robots….seriously. If your package is important to you spend the extra money and use another courier! Do not waste your time with purolator!!"

"Literally the worst company - my apartment does not have an access code and I didn't want them to leave the package outside so I requested that somebody call or text me when they're here. They buzzed once, I answered within the next 2 minutes, and no one's at the door. Was I supposed to know this? Apparently their drivers don't always have phones on them (bit ridiculous really, since they deliver to all sorts of housing/buildings) and can't call or aren't allowed to call. Now it's 'held for pickup' - transporting it was YOUR job! I resorted to asking them to just leave my package outside my building - not safe, but I can't skip work because their drivers 'aren't allowed' to communicate with customers. Shame on Amazon too, for their absolutely garbage coordination."

Well to top off how pathetic this company is they won't release my package with my son's winter jacket to my roommate. Now my kid has to freeze while the package gets sent back. Roommate had all screen shots of purchase and photo id for confirmation of purchase as have done it this way multiple times as I work out of town. Purolator sucks absolutely pathetic customer service AVOID PUROLATOR AT ALL COSTS THEY ARE A JOKE

"I waited a good part of the day for delivery of a parcel that was out for delivery.
After a fruitless number of hours without receipt of my package I checked the tracking information and saw that delivery had been attempted and that the receiver was inaccessible. I live in an apartment building that fronts a well maintained street; the driver had, I'm guessing, simply gone to the wrong door.
Other carriers (FedEx, UPS, Canada Post, Intelcomm) make deliveries to this building on a daily basis; to the best of my knowledge only Purolator has been unable to find the correct door.
I'm with the vast majority of people who have submitted reviews- Purolator service is terrible and the company does not deserve to remain as a going concern. Going forward, wherever possible, I will request of vendors to not use Purolator as the carrier for products that I order."

"First of all, the tracking information they provided online is inaccurate. We had a business delivery set-up for an overnight delivery and it showed that it arrived and was received in their sorting facility in Calgary today at 8am. Upon phoning and attempting to get help, the agents explained that it was stuck at the very end of the trailer. I even offered to pick it up from their facility. The items were needed for a tomorrow. The lady gives me the bad news and asks if I want to pick it up at the depot on Monday instead. What a joke.- Update: Delphine below asked me to send them the tracking number so they can look into it. However there hasn't been any follow through. So what's the point? I've exhausted all efforts to aquire our package that is deemed useless after this weekend. So my thought on Purolator's response below? Insincere bot. Unreliable as the rest of your staff."
"To be continued from my previous comment from yesterday about how sucked Purolator is. So I am in Germany. Last night after being on hold by Purolator for an hour (long distance), I finally talked to a lady. She told me my package was given to DHL to be delivered. She gave me a new tracking number and the phone number of DHL. So now I had to wait until next day, day time to call. And I did….and guess what? They can only speak German, no English. How does that make sense? I am from Canada and come to Germany. I asked a friend in Canada to send me something. The courier company from Canada gives my package to their partner company (they said it is their partner in the email they sent me) and this partner doesn’t speak English…. It just doesn’t make sense. Guys, if you don’t believe me and want to buy trouble and headache, then go for PureLater."
"I'm not sure why there are so many terrible reviews on this company. I've dealt with this courrier for 16 years, a minimum of once a month for my business needs. My product orders are delivered within 24 to 36 hours from the time I called the sales rep, to the time it's at my door, and that's even coming from out of the province. I could count on 1 hand how many times they've been at fault for something, and when it has happened that product arrived damaged or was lost it was immediately rectified. Yes, this is absolutely in part due to my product supplier's amazing customer service, but I would only ship with Purolator over ANY other shipping service provider I've used, and could tell you many many negative stories about those."
"Trash service. I WOULD GIVE -50 stars if that was an option.

This has been happening since past 3 years with me. Every freaking single time I have to go and pickup the parcel. PUROLATOR IS TRASH.

The drivers NEVER call or rings the buzzer for deliveries. By NEVER I MEAN NEVER EVER. They should sell this company. Whenever I see Purolator as my delivery company, I get nightmares… coz I know that I would be picking up from pickup location as usual.

Who created this trash company? Its not the 1st time. It’s the 20th time I am facing this in past 3 years and it’s absolutely frustrating. Not even a single call or buzzer before delivering.

Throw your company in a garbage can and never ever think of starting a company again. RETHINK YOUR LIFE CHOICES."
"I wish I could be able to give even negative rating for Purolator. No wonder why it has overall such a bad rating in any province of canada. They never call us while attempting delivery and we can never expect to resolve the issue in customer support. They are great liar though!
Each and every aspect of their service is worst. How they are still doing deliveries in Canada even after evey one wants to get rid of it!"

"I am a regular customer of Purolator and so far I am satisfied with their Shipping service. This time I called their Customer service line to inquire if I can ship cooked lobster from Toronto to my cousin in Illinois. The Customer Service Rep. named Janet was very rude and condescending from the start of our conversation. She even asked me what did I shipped before to Illinois so I replied that I regularly send Cereals, chocolates and cookies made here in Canada to my cousin who has severe allergies because she find that most of the food products here are chemical and nut free. She vehemently said that those food products are prohibited from being shipped! and she asked for my previous tracking numbers like a police questioning a suspect! I told her straight that she is so rude and condescending and demanded to talk to a supervisor. She was even adamant that I am the one who was yelling! which is untrue since I am an agreeable person who talks politely and relatively slow. I was able to talk to her supervisor Angela who just listened to my complaints about their rude representative but did not even apologize on behalf of Janet's horrendous attitude!"

After they received correction request from my phone company, they did not schedule the delivery on the next business, not even the next 2 business day.

After 1 hour, i saw my tracking update to delivery attempted, reschedule to next delivery. This is ridiculous. How the driver like this is hired?"

"I live in rural Alberta and the Purolator center in Calgary is responsible for this area.
On several occasions,my item was not scanned until the day it was supposed to be delivered which is frustrating to say the least.
Whoever the driver is that services my village, Standard, has quite the imagination.
My last three shipments were a day or more late due to ""road closures""which didn't exist and on one occasion, the drive noted that there was nobody home except that I watched his van drive down the alley behind my house without stopping.
I understand that things happen and the drivers get behind schedule but,spare me the prevarication.
The latest event was yesterday, package out for delivery at 07:41 and at 17:09 the tracking page indicated that the driver was unable to deliver because of a ""road closure"". I checked 511 Alberta and there was no closure anywhere near Standard.
This driver needs to be spoken to regarding these ongoing fabrications."
"Honestly. How hard is it to register a label, pickup and track a parcel in the 21st century.

If you want your order to show up more or less on time, use Canada Post. If you want your order to enjoy a whimsical journey of self discovery, seemingly without end, go Purolator. Can’t even get a human on the phone after an hour of trying, gave up.
Now, for the cut and paste Purolator response to the review, please see below…
Update: Now it’s back in Ontario4 days later and been scanned into…and departed…twice…from the Ontario Hub."

"This is not the first time that the driver was very lazy when he wanted to drop off my item. He left the notice without trying second attempt on the Oct 21th. I have been looking for my Item for 6 days. The people work in Coquitlam/High street store are also careless people and impolite. They told me "" you are dishonset because I told Mr Mustafa who works there I got a message that you got my item but he said not available. The next day after I made my call with Purolator I found it in the store already since yesterday, but he did not help me the day before and just said to me ""come tomorrow"". Then, his co-worker said this message (I got on my phone) from our store and you need to show it to him yesterday, I said I did for sure that is why I came here yesterday. I surprised with his bad attitude. He said to me “you are dishonest"" and we went through argument chat. I really disappointed Purolater service is very bad and do not watch their employees’ behavior. I don’t recommend this business for people respect their clients."

"I ordered a new phone and it was shipped via purolator and they had my address just not my unit number, so instead of leaving a card they just didn’t stop at all. I then did a request for pickup at their location in Kingston. Was told I may be able to get it Tuesday before 6pm. That didn’t happen. Then was told I could get it today before 6. Guess what? That didn’t happen either.

This is the first and last time I’m using this company. Now I can see why they’re only rated 1.1 stars. What a joke."

"Long story short: initial ""attempted delivery"" did not occur (no one rang my buzzer nor called me and I was home all day), called to reschedule the delivery.
Did not get redelivered.
Called again. They said the depot is behind and would reschedule delivery in two more days.
Two days pass, no redelivery. I call again, and they basically say there's nothing they can do. They can't provide me with a number for the depot, they can't contact anyone from the depot to check in, so basically my only option is to pick up if I want my package. I don't own a car; this is a piece of furniture which is why I'm having it delivered.

I've never experienced a worse delivery company than Purolator. If you've ever received your package from Purolator without having to pick it up, consider yourselves the lucky 1%.
I've already reached out to ask the furniture store to stop using Purolator, and I'll keep doing this for any shopping that I do in the future."
"Brickyard location “under construction” with no other information on door to redirect people, specific for QR code scanner to allow Amazon returns. Other locations listed online useless (no one offers this service at any other Brampton location?!) and telephone automated service also useless. Online information on Oct 21 also showed this location as open. It had since been updated to show “temporarily closed”."

"Took 5 (and counting) days off work to receive a package. Every day they said it would arrive the next day, but everyday it failed to arrive. Spent hours on the phone to no avail. Dreadful.

EDIT: 2 days since I emailed the reply below and still no sign of my package, just more promises and lies."
It’s beyond me why any businesses would intentionally use Purolator for shipping their products. I buy lots of stuff online and never have an issue when its sent through Canada Post or any other shipping company. Every time I’ve had an immensely frustrating experience with shipping it’s been with Purolator. I’ll have to be more diligent in the future ensure online retailers I shop with use any other shipping companies.

"Still waiting about 2 hours to find where package is, agent keeps transferring to different department
This is not right"
"Wish I could give them less then 1 star. NEVER had a good experience. EVERY SINGLE package has arrived damaged, after arriving 1-2 months late. They used every excuse under the sun. ""mechanical delay"" ""attempted delivery but not home"" WHEN I WAS HOME ALL DAY WAITING. Every single time when I've been given strange reasons why for why its not being delivered, I get transferred to a ""tracing specialist"" who is supposed to ""monitor"" what is happening with the package. For weeks and weeks they say ""we are looking into it"" and don't help at all. I tried to file a formal complaint and got bounced around and then everyone stopped replying and no one helped me. They are a mess and treat their paying customers like absolute garbage."

"Dreadful company. Used a drop box to put a return at busy Toronto Union station on Sept 28th. After two weeks I realized it was strange to have no retailer update. The tracking showed only ""label created"" so clearly there was an issue. I opened a ticket to which they closed after a week saying sorry for the inconvenience but there isn't anything we can do as we have no proof I they received it. After escalating there isn't a thing, they can do for me and I'm out $80. Being told I didn't drop it off. AVOID at all costs using the drop boxes. I asked the manager who called me if I should video drop offs in future, she had no reply so clearly one should. Truly a horrible company that I suggest you try to avoid if at all possible."

"Just look at the cut and paste replies to everyone who is giving 1 star to this awful company.

Support is awful they come to your house and if no one's home they deliver the package somewhere 10km away while there are plenty of pick up points 1-2 blocks away.

They need to go out of business for the horrible quality of service they are giving us Canadians.

Btw, remember if you have more than two issues with Purolator on amazon, you can have them de-priorotized so they wont use this company to deliver anything to you.

"On September 22,2022 my niece sent 6 Rubbermaid bins of personal and household items to Halifax Nova Scotia. She was moving there for a job. The shipment receipt from the Calgary depot indicates transit time to be 5 days. I paid for the service with my credit card over $1100.00. She asked that the delivery to take place on September 29, because she wouldn’t arrive I. Halifax until late on September 28 (which would have been her scheduled delivery date) and was told that it wouldn’t be a problem. On September 27, she sent another 5 bins and again was told that it would be 5 transit days and payment of over$850.00 was paid.Needless to say deliveries never happened when they were supposed to. My niece never got any calls about impending deliveries ( she works right around the corner from her residence so meeting the delivery wouldn’t have been a problem). In fact she would get notice that no one was home to receive deliveries. This was not the case as my neice’s partner was there the whole time. Numerous phone calls resulted in no resolutions. it took 3 different deliveries over a 3 week period to finally get the bins. Some we damaged with big holes in the bottoms of the bins! When she called the company about the deliveries she was told that if she wanted delivery on a weekend she would have to pay extra! Not only was she not requesting weekend delivery they had the nerve after paying that much money to ask for more. The experience has left us with a sour taste in our mouths. We will never recommend this company. They are totally unreliable and communication with them goes absolutely no where. I am talking specifically about the Halifax branch! The Calgary depot should never have indicated that the transit time would be 5 days in both cases. They charge a premium price for their non existing service. We should have read the many reviews before even considering the company. I have no idea how any service company can be so very unprofessional especially when their goal is supposed to be service. They really should be compensating the affected customers!
Sorry, but I don’t buy the excuse that the power was out and caused a delay that massive! My niece was in constant contact with the company and was never told anything about a power outage causing a problem! What about all the calls saying there was no one at the apartment to receive delivery when there was!! Excuse after excuse for a 3 week delay in receiving her own items! I can’t believe that your company is still in business, but of course since it’s tied to Canada Post (a crown corporation) I guess that justifies it somehow! If I ran a business that way, I certainly wouldn’t last long in the SERVICE industry!"

Update: Thank you for the information. Please note it may be best to remove your tracking numbers from this post to protect your privacy.

"I have been at home all day waiting for my package to arrive.
I’m tracking the delivery in my mobile device and it’s goes from “out for delivery” to “attempted delivery-no one home”
Ummmmmmm????
So , we have cameras that lead up to our front door and we can see who is coming up the driveway. There was no body that attempted to deliver this package AT all.
Called customer service. Waited on hold 30 minutes. Lady tells me that the delivery driver tried but I wasn’t available to answer door. Ok…….. so… I am a liar?
I literally have been here all day, no ring notification has come through, no one has dropped by to say hello let alone drop off my package.
I explained that the driver MUST have gone to the wrong house and that they needed to send the driver back but the customer service rep said “one delivery attempt per day” and seemed to not believe me whatsoever that no one has been here.
She reiterated my address which only irritated me further. Yes, I know where I live, but does purolator?
Obviously not.
There is nothing more frustrating than waiting at home all day, with proof that no one came around,only to be told that they came and too bad so sad.
Unbelievable"

"I was expecting my package to arrive on Oct 19. I got 2 notifications indicating that there were several failed delivery attempts, but I work from home and there are other 3 people living in the same house. Definitely, there was no one even trying to deliver the package. I requested to know a pickup location to go by myself, but this is the 3rd time that nobody gives me that info and the package keeps going again for ""delivery"". It has been 3 days without being able to pick up my item and with nobody showing up at my place. The driver did not even bother leaving a delivery notice, so I have no clues on what's happening. Lastly, the customer service representatives (Susan and Brennan) did not even pay attention to my situation and just copied/pasted template answers indicating that nobody answered the door when the driver arrived these 2 times.

Definitely a terrible service."

"On Friday I got a notification that my parcel could not be delivered due to incorrect address, but it was not incorrect. I called Purolator and they said he couldn't find my house but he actually had to drive by it twice to get in an out of town and the streets are marked and I have the house number on the front. Plus it's on goggle maps. Later that day I got a notification that the parcel was dropped off at the depot in the next town which is a half hour drive. I again called Purolator and told them I would pick it up at the depot today. I drove to the depot today and was told that Purolator told him to ship the parcel back. Now I have to wait another 4 or 5 days for them to reship it. ZERO STARS!"

It amazes me that people are still a company, it is certainly not functioning. Every order I make i tell every company not to use purolator or else my business will go elsewhere. Please do the same, purolator has to change or shut down. It's a complete joke and sham! Two days, home waiting by the door, no knock or door bell. Come outside and there's a slip by the door saying delivery attempt failed. Every fu*$&ng order that is sent through purolator takes an extra week to get my my package.

"Update to a review on Friday (still terrible): I called as my package wasn't listed as being redelivered. Apparently drivers ""do not have time or the ability"" to understand how delivering packages to a multi-unit building work with an intercom. I was told that I had to put clear instructions on the package as walking into a foyer, looking at a list of names and entering the buzzer number into the keypad is beyond their drivers ability / comprehension / time. I have never added my buzzer information to delivery instructions and for the past 10 years that I have lived at this address have had countless other successful deliveries. I was also told that this ""was not our driver as it was contracted out"" - this is not my problem. However Purolator wants to deliver the package - either through their own drivers or contracted drivers - it all comes through under one name - so if the company isn't capable of reviewing and managing the quality of their contracted providers - that's still on them. At this point, my minimal interactions with Purolator are making UPS / FedEx seem extremely competent."
"They won't actually deliver the package!

I was home all day on the day they were supposed to deliver this package. I knew the package was being delivered that day, so I was ready and waiting. After a while I check the tracking status and I see that the new update is that they ""attempted delivery but the receiver was unavailable"". I was home all day and there was no knock, no phone call, no buzzer, absolutely nothing. Then I check my mailbox and see they didn't even leave a delivery notice which causes me to think that they never actually came by. I spent 20 minutes on hold trying to talk to a customer service agent, and when I finally got one, she told me it will be redelivered the next business day (Monday). I was annoyed because Friday was the only day I was home all day but relieved I would be getting the package. I guess however the agent did absolutely nothing because 5 hours later I get an email saying my package is available for pickup and I have to go to THEIR warehouse to pickup my package that was supposed to be DELIVERED to me. The package is heavy and I do not drive which is one of the reasons I had it delivered in the first place! I try to be understanding that it is not everyone in the company's fault but it seems like no one I've interacted with has actually done their job here. After reading online it seems like this is such a common experience and I don't think anyone has actually received a package from them.

I wish online shopping companies would stop using Purolator as they are by far the absolute worst shipping company there is. I would pay extra to avoid this joke of a company"

"Worst service ever from a delivery company. I have had them on multiple occasions delivering stuff. They do no consider that their customers could possibly have disabilities, be sick, or do not have cars to pick up their packages from locations from their ""failed delivery"". They lie and do not even attempt to deliver. I have seen it on multiple occasions. They are frauds and do no deserve any business.

"I will never buy anything online again when Purolator is the delivery company. I took the whole day off from work only to get a message on their tracker webpage around 5:00 pm which says “attempted delivery failed - receiver unavailable “. I cannot believe Purolator would blatantly lie about a nonexistent attempted delivery. I have a hidden camera Installed on my porch ceiling that showed no one came to the door ever, no notice slip left. Worst of all, when I called and complained, the company doesn’t seem to give a damn. Isn’t there a competitor out there? Why vendors continue to use Purolator? I rather pay more for the delivery than going through the pain of putting up with Purolator!"

"This company is a joke and deserves a zero star. I was home all day yesterday and not once did I hear a knock or did not even attempt to rang the doorbell. I get outside in the afternoon and saw a note and telling me to pick up my package in a nearby storage, so I went there and they are telling me its not there and need to pick it up in Vaughn thats like 45mins away from me and to think of it I paid for a delivery fee. I tried explaining to a customer service and she refused to listen and will not even atleast refund me the delivery fee if I go pick it up.

"They are so bad that everyone in our apartment building jokes that their trucks don't have packages... We say they just drive around with trucks full of door stickers. Because they just plant the door stickers in the lobby and leave without a word. The couple of times neighbours catch them in the act and ask for a package the driver always looks miffed. It's different drivers too.

They do not use the buzzer. Though they will claim it is always broken. (We know it's not broken) they don't call or attempt to knock on anyone's door. Considering this is an issue across Canada I can only imagine this must be an upper management issue. They must be rushing the drivers or not vetting them properly.

This has been going on for years so not just a one time thing and it started before the pandemic.

It is frustrating because when we miss a package they send it to a facility on the other side of town and customer service will try to bully you into picking it up even if there are life circumstances that prevent doing just that. We practically have to shout at them to redeliver. We do not have a vehicle. Traveling to the facility would not only cost a lot of money but would take a lot of time and be a huge inconvenience.

This is a delivery service. The whole point is that the package gets DELIVERED. DO YOUR JOBS! 😩

Also first time attempt guaranteed to miss the driver everytime."

"UPDATE: Finally got my package today (Thursday).
As a side note, I had to run out for a second around 8am and saw a Purolator truck at the gas station near me. The driver was in the store checking his lottery tickets, and yes it was the driver who brought my order 20 minutes later...I live less than a minute away from the gas station.
Ordered on line and they deliver with Purolator. It is a (within) Vancouver to Vancouver delivery. I got a tracking number Monday Oct. 3rd and it seemed like the package was on it's way being sorted etc. on the first day Purolator recieved it. It was on a truck at 6am Tuesday for delivery the next day (yesterday). All of a sudden at 4pm the tracking says deliver rescheduled for the next day (today). I phoned and was told it was a ""mechanical"" issue. I expressed my need for the package and the customer rep said she would make a note saying for the package to be delivered as soon as possible today. It is now 4:30 pm and the package has been in delivery mode since 6am....this is not what I would consider delivering it asap the next day. I have to go out in about 45 minutes and if the package doesn't arrive by then, I guess I'll have to pick it up in a day or two...making my delivery, that was supposed to be next day, almost a week getting to me.
Not acceptable.
Also not acceptable the package didn't arrive today either, Wednesday allegedly the driver missed the package and delivery. This is completely unprofessional especially when the get paid somewhere around $32/hr at a union job."

"Purolator never attempted the delivery of my TV, they never rang my doorbell, they just left a notice. Which will force me to walk 4 blocks to a penguin pick up and drag the 55 inch TV back on my own. And this isn't the first time that they do this. I know that when the courier is Purolator, I'm in for a bad experience. I honestly do not think there is any vetting of their drivers for safety either as I've had to jump back on to the sidewalk on at least 2 occasions as the trucks come screaming in and the drivers park on a pedestrian cross walk. Yes, I know that I shouldn't step off the sidewalk until my light is green but when opposing traffic light is yellow and about to turn red most people here will step onto the cross walk. And drivers who park on the crosswalk force pedestrians out into traffic. All in all I think the majority of Purolator staff should probably be fired and replaced due to incompetence, but all of the drivers definitely need to go."

"Thé worst experience and anxiety of my life.
Worst customer service possible !!
I have been waiting for my laptop for 10 days, They claimed attempt of delivery and failure / receiver unavailable twice while I’m here sitting in next to the door since 7 am and they have NEVER CAME / NEVER RANG ON MY DOOR
I called 4 times , they said they’re sending a message to the driver and NOTHING happened
What a loss of time and energy with these CLOWNS"

"Tracking said estimated delivery to be September 29. Did not get delivered checked the next day and it now says no date available. Tried to get more info as we have trouble with porch pirates, called at 1:35 pm and it said they were closed even though the recording said they were open until 10:00. Let’s get it together Purolator!!!

Oct 3 still waiting for package. Checked tracking no update since Sept 28. Did an online chat with Lori she said I would have it buy the end of the day. Checked the tracking again and it said it was in Alberta….called Purolator now maybe Wednesday or Thursday. What a joke Purolator.

Package still shows it is in Alberta with no updates since October 4 a 4:30 am. They now have a tracking specialist on it asking for description, cost, model number, photos and more. I have been lied to by two Purolator employees. Will most likely contact my credit card company for a refund."

"I have never, NEVER, gotten a package first day from Purolator. It’s always excuses such as weather, buzzer not working, location locked, adress incorrect. I live in downtown, the adress has never been wrong, I DONT HAVE a buzzer. It says very clear to call me if they don’t know how to reach me…they’ve never tried to even put my package down, lost a package once and they said it was delivered but it wasn’t , it was delivered two days later. Right now, I’m still trying to contact them without them giving me an attitude about delivering a cat tower…are the boxes too heavy for you to bring to the front door or what?"

"Such an outdated way of shipping. there’s no estimated time of arrival, so if a signature is required, you literally have to wait around all day, so you don’t miss the delivery and half the time the delivery people don’t knock, they just lazily put the slip in your mailbox and leave. I’ve had this happen multiple times when I’m home waiting."
Today I waited all day for a pkg to arrive. Finally at 3 pm I checked the tracking and was told that delivery was attempted. The driver did not ring my unit at all. They put a attempted delivery notice in front lobby and left. This company really needs to start checking their drivers and making sure that they are actually trying to contact the recipients of pkgs.

"Driver in whistler says he was unable to deliver the package, in reality they sat in the van, didn’t try knocking/ringing the bell or calling the number you have to give in case they need to contact you. Let’s hope they are less lazy on attempt three.

Edit. Day three and still no delivery, it’s now going to come in five days time. A $14000 item and they’re treating it like it doesn’t matter to them."

They don't attempt delivery this is lies. No delivery is attempted no slip is left they drop it off at some random place and there's no way to go pick up the package. This service is useless I will forever avoid using this delivery service.

"When I checked the tracking number for my package, it said ""a delivery attempt was made at 11;19 today if you received a notice"" blah blah, except that the driver never left a notice and said that there was no answer, I was at home it is a apartment building with a comm system that rings your cell phone, The phone never rang. When I called customer service, the driver said I did not answer, (it's a lie) and that he could not leave a notice . funny, UPS,FEDEX and Canada post all leave notices. When I asked why, nobody could answer me. So finally, I asked to pick up my package to a pre arranged location. I hope it will be there when I come. Oh, and the virtual assistant AI is just a few cells above an amoeba, totally useless, in all, I spent 2 hours trying to track my package because of an incompetent driver who lied, and did not left a notice. I received a lot of packages from UPS, FEDEX, DHL but only 3 so far with Purolator, I think I know why now. If you can , use another service, or don't . I know I will avoid them even if it cost more. I put one star only because the lady on the phone was very helpful, but the driver is dishonest and lying, 0 star for him or her."

"At 7pm Sept 23, 2022 I went to the Squires Beach Rd depot to collect a package I missed delivery on. This was for a phone from Fido. Its impossible to arrange a re-delivery via virtual assistant. When there I was told it was in the locker and to check my text as a message was sent out. I explained it was for a damaged phone replacement and could not retrieve msg. The Lady working the shift started yelling at me that it was her job to put all items in lockers when questioned why it was placed within. I calmly tried to explain the situation but she was totally rude and commenced yelling again with atleast 6 people in lobby. I politely asked to stop yelling and explain as her coworker attempted to explain to her my issue. This employee needs anger management training and should not be allowed to deal with public. Worst experience ever and will share my ordeal with many through social media on how rude Purolator Employee was. Be aware of the tall blonde mid 50""s woman working there. She embarrassed her coworkers as well as every other customer within lobby area"

"Worst service EVER !

I was supposed to get my package delivered yesterday so I stayed home the whole day checking my phone every 5 minutes to make sure I do not miss it.

They tried to call me but the call rang once before it ended. I called back twice while my boyfriend was getting outside (we live in a building of appartements).
They picked up the phone and hung up without saying anything.
When I finally got to talk to someone over the phone, the woman said she had left.
Plus she DID NOT leave any note on when and how to get our item. We did not received any update by email or text (which I had signed up for).

I tried to reach someone on their website yesterday using the chat but it is fu**** up! It says to check the note that has been left on how to get our package but the delivery person did not leave ANY.
When I request to be connected to an agent, there IS NO ONE available or it keeps ""connecting to an agent"" forever with no one picking up.

When I ask for redelivery on Monday at last, it says it can only be by tuesday.
BUT, I can make arrangements to be home on Monday (still I have to work so I can not spend the whole day outside in front of the building !) but not for the rest of the week.
I have to go to the office and so does my boyfriend.

We called customer service and waited for so long but non one answered. Thé automatic thing said they have no information about where the package is so impossible to schedule a pick up or anything else.

We need this package urgently but it seems they are doing anything to prevent that from happening.

We are very upset about the quality of their service which is extremely poor!

Do not recommend at all!!"

"In the past year none of my packages have been delivered to my door. Instead I have to go pick them up from a shipping store, which can be difficult if you have limited access to a car like I do. There have also been at least 3 times when they didn't even leave a tag to let me know that a package was ready for pick up. I suppose they manage the shipping side of the business okay (my package is in the right city) but the delivery side of the business is severely lacking."

"Purolator lies when they advertises `It's not a package, it is a promise`. I paid an extra fee to receive a personal document within Ottawa region (source and destination), they sent my package to Montreal, the urgent request team does not work on weekends. I received my package 7 days after the ""promise"" in consequence to this lack of respect and customer commitment I lost a business trip because I did not have my document in hands.

"Awful experience. Did not receive package and upon calling the customer service, they were rude and 2 customer service representatives essentially yelled at me. They punched my address into the computer and yelled ""it has been delivered"". Even after I continually said ""I know it was not delivered, I was home at the time of the delivery time"".

After a third attempt, the representative finally sent my case to investigations.

A week later, purolator is on my doorstep with my package as they had delivered it to the wrong house. What I had been telling them all alone.

No apology either. Will never order with this company again."

"I don't often write reviews, but having dealt with five bellends at this particular company I felt I had to get it off my chest. Just don't use Purolator. One of the worst customer experiences I've ever had.

UPDATE Day 5:
A day on (this is day 5 trying to get my package), and the customer service has actually become worse. I was today informed that my order was 'on it's way'. This is not the case. When phoning Puralator, 'Jenny' answered. Put me on hold, and then just left me on hold - until 'Brooke' answered. She told me that yet another colleague had put in the wrong address information. Utterly, utterly useless.
Hopefully if you are reading this review, you will consider using a different company.

UPDATE: Day 7.
So far I've been told...
• To pick up my package from Aero Drive.
• The package is stuck in a locker - I was literally told this by the gentleman who put the item in the locker.
• That the package would be sent to Eastem World Wide Inc in Calgary.
• That the address was wrong.
• That the address change had come through.
• That the address change had not come through.
• Confirmation that the address change had come through.
• That the address change hadn't actually come through.
• That the package was 'on it's way' again.
• That there was a problem.
• And now... nothing.

UPDATE:
Because even the company that is sending me the package think that Purolator are hopeless, they have phoned them and confirmed that the emails that Purolator deny having were definitely sent. So either Purolator have systems that don't work, or employees that don't know what they are doing (probably both).

FINAL UPDATE (YOU'LL LOVE THIS):
So... I've just heard from the company that sent the package - and Purolator have informed them that they have LOST the package. I thought this was the case, and have been continually lied to by numerous people at Purolator, that it was still coming.
The irony is - I know where the phone is, and have been telling them this for 7 days. An employee at Aero Drive PUT IT IN A LOCKER. I spoke to him. I met him. He knows it's there (or else it was a very strange lie to tell, and make me drive to the facility to pick it up)!
So - if you use Purolator, you MIGHT get your package, or you might be lied to and then still NOT get your package. Your mileage may vary. All I know is, the package is being sent, and Canada Post is being used."

"I went into the Sydney depot Purolator yesterday. I was in a complete fret as my daughter was back in Ottawa and needed these 2 articles of clothing by Friday. At Purolator I met 2 amazing employees June and Shelly. From their friendly greeting to their helpful suggestions on the best way to send these articles, I felt like I was in the company of friends! To say they were beyond helpful, kind and professional would certainly be an understatement. The computer was really slow , and would not accept payment. They tried several attempts and were so apologetic. It didn’t seem like lost time because we were chatting. This is the kind of service companies strive for, where the customers leaves feeling welcomed , valued and treated like a friend. I would like to suggest that these two ladies get some kind of recognition. Valued employees like these two ladies should be made an example of , they deserve it and have earned it. I can only imagine how amazing life would be if every person in these positions had just a bit of their kindness and helpfulness . I look forward to using Purolator again and will sing Purolator’s praises for such amazing service!!! Many thanks Frances Allan"
"This has to be the worst courier service ever! I had a home internet package that was sent to a completely wrong address in a far off province, and they took their time re-routing it. I kept getting false promises of delivery from the customer service agents and even as I type this, I still haven't received my next day delivery more than a week later! Instead, the customer service agent flippantly told me it will take an additional 48 hours for a trace specialist to work on my case. How am I supposed to get work done with my modem lost in Lord knows where? No one apologises. No one is trying to fix it. There's no reason Fido should maintain a contract with them! Absolutely horrible courier!"
Worst delivery service ever. I never trust these guys. Pathetic service. I wonder how they just get an excuse every time to miss the delivery.

"The staff working at Kipling on Thursday September 15th 2022 at 3:30pm should all be fired; including the manager. They literally laughed at the line up of irate customers as they refused to help us. It was appalling. Our packages were placed in self-serve boxes outside the facility which we could not access and they would not open for us even though we had our delivery notices and ID. Nowhere on the delivery notice did it mention that we needed a special code to access these boxes. Allegedly, the box codes were texted to us so they can't open the lock boxes. This is absolutely ridiculous and an obvious lie. I've never experienced a company so happy to be so unhelpful.

When I explained that I could not access my texts because the package I was picking up was a new phone, they told me to contact the phone company. They wouldn't let me use their phone or wifi to contact my phone provider even after I explained that I had no way to contact them on my own because I had no working phone.

Myself and another customer demanded to see the manager who refused to come out. What I would like to know is, what will happen to the lock box my phone is in when I request reattempt delivery? They are going to have to open the lock box to send it back to me so they obviously can access the lock boxes.

Fido and Rogers need to end their contracts with Purolator immediately.
Their service is trash and they treat people like trash."

"Had a smoker ordered for 2 day delivery. Two weeks later not days weeks later of no updates i called customee support and they said ""it was a bit big so we transferred it to another company."" So i asked to be put on email and txt notifications. I never got an email saying it was transferred or even saying it was on the way. Now two days later so 16 days in total on my two day delivery it says the package has been lost. I find it pretty suspicious that it goes missing the day they transferred it. It seems like one of them may have taken it but i dont got any proof besides the big run around they gave me. Would never recommend anyone to use them."
"Parcel was left in the lobby of my apartment building - no attempt was made to contact me to let me know they were there with my delivery - I was away and had filled out delivery instructions that the parcel was only to be left if it was handed to me and that I would pick up at the Purolator facility at a later date if not home.
I cannot believe the package was still sitting in the lobby today - they are generally stolen! You cannot leave packages in an apartment complex lobby! Seriously!
Obviously the delivery people don’t give a darn about how they deliver parcels! There is an entire feed on Facebook from yesterday regarding deliveries in Owen Sound yesterday that were literally thrown out of the van into peoples driveways - camera footage is available! Horrible service! This is not my first complaint regarding this company - and I’m guessing it won’t be my last - given a choice, Purolator would not deliver any parcels to me!"

The package wasn't delivered two days ago. My phone connected to the buzzer system never wrang. It was supposed to be redelivered yesterday. Nope. Made arrangements for today. Nope. Now Amazon has sent a replacement that I probably also won't receive. They do this everytime. Everything I order that purolater delivers has to be reordered and turns into a nightmare to resolve. Really bad company. If I'd known when ordering that puralotor was involved I wouldn't have bothered.

Purolator makes it to hard to communicate with them. Was on hold for over 2 hours to arrange for a Neighbor to sign for a package that should of been here last week. Went on line found the guidelines followed them by leaving a note authorizing the Neighbor to sign on my door as per their information. The driver still refused to allow it so I had to leave work early in order to get to the pickup depot before it closed to retrieve a package that should of arrived during the days my husband was home to sign for it. Not happy!

"Still an awful company. I wrote a review a few months ago where Purolator failed to follow-up on a missed delivery. Now, they have failed to deliver a modular sofa from Cozey on two estimated delivery dates.

The purolator social media person will likely send a canned response to this review but will not do any positive action with the information. I hope all businesses and individuals avoid doing business with Purolator so that they can (hopefully) see how terrible their service is."

Very poor service. Will not be a service I will use ever again. Parcel was not delivered but tracking notice showed it was and no one was available. I was home at what supposedly the time of delivery. Called customer service and was not successful in reaching a live person to talk to.
"Third day my girlfriend watch front the windows (second floor) and I wait outside in front of the door (first/ground floor) for hours because I want to be sure I wont miss them. I met the Amazon and Canada post delivery guys, but I NEVER saw someone working for Purolator. I still get notifications that I missed it. Not only they are super late, but they are liars. They didnt come and they tell us that it’s our fault. Worst delivery company ever. Now we are waiting for hours and hours on phone and they never answer. What can we do to finally have the thing we bought? Will we have a couch one day? And by the way, we have cameras so we can prove that you never came. If I could go 0 star, I would."

"The worst service I deal with it
For me is - 5 stars.
I can get my package on time always something happen and I don't get my packages.
Terrible service."
No stars - they deliver to the wrong address and don’t answer the phone!
Would be great if they actually knocked on a darn door. They just slap the notification on your door and leave. Last time it took me 3 months to straighten o9ut what they did wrong. I was even told by the person at purolator all they have to do is deliver it and it does not even have to be at the door. Had one package left at my front gate right next to a busy street. One package they delivered the wrong thing. Took 3 months to straighten it out. Lazy ignorant deliveries.

I received my package like the title says
"First experience with this company and I hope it’ll be the last. My package was out for delivery on the truck. I was at home waiting all day for the package as I didn’t want to miss it. 5.30pm rolls around and still no delivery, so I contacted them, only to be told that the driver “missed” my delivery and brought it back to the warehouse to be resent out for delivery. I asked if I could go to collect it as it is an important package, and the assistant on the chat said it might not be able to be today and left the chat. I have since been on hold for over 20 minutes trying to get hold of them, and had previously been on hold for 15 but was cut off. Appalling service"

All they do is stick a tag on your door saying you weren't home. I was home all day. My neighbour has witnessed the driver just doing so without knocking on the door/ringing the bell! This has happened twice for the past 8 days. Then they ask you to pick up the item from their warehouse where is 20 KM away from my place and takes an hour to make a long trip back and forth! Poor customer service on top of that. All you get is a generic answer from their staff manual. AVOID!

"They say they tried to deliver my package, but it was 5 days early, so I was not home.
My package has been sent to a shipping location, but that has taken 5 days within my area and it's still not available for pick up, when the package itself came from the other side of the country faster than that. I beg Amazon and any other company to stop using these delivery companies who have no customer service skills, poor pay for their drivers and no accountability for their behaviour.
Additional comment: they finally said it was available for pick up but wouldn't tell me where. Then it turns out, it's 6 blocks away, that took 5 days to achieve - unbelievable!"

"If I could rate this company 0 starts I would. My package was supposed to arrive on a Friday and it was never delivered. It's now Tuesday and it has been sitting in my town for 5 days now and no delivery. I am not allowed to come pick it up either, even though it's in my town 10 minutes away. What a joke of a company.

Worst service here in Labrador.....short of staff.... package is holding up for more than 2-3 weeks. I have to go and pick up most of my packages. Manger doesn't apologize for the inconvenience to the customer but shouts back and tells she can't manage the situation. Now the customer service is even more pathetic..after waiting for 23 min a lazy Filipino male voice with an artificial Canadian accent picks up the phone and when I told my inconvenience even he didn't apologize for that but straight asked me the package no. Don't know what's going on in Purolator.....sorry to see this...

"Purolater. the only delivery company that doesn't Deliver. A parcel was sent to me to arrive the next day ..it is for a medical device I'm in excruciating pain without . I ordered the fastest way I could, through Amazon for next day service and Purolater CLAIMED they came first at 11.27 except at that time as was with the building management at the front door ..so he must have been invisible to us normal humans. ( he lied) Next day I get a call that they're coming and I wait , then check online to find The LIAR said he couldn't reach me again ..yet I'm still sitting here because I'm disabled and can;t move without that part.Then after waiting 33 minutes on their phone line , they tell me Oh well it will come next week some time. Why does this Company EVEN EXIST? Really?"
"It has taken 3 days to deliver a package a total of 80 kms, and still do not have it, tracking for a day has been in and out of sorting hubs, when I call they will not even allow us to come to the sorting hub to pick up the part, so our production is being held up by $68.00 worth of parts. PATHETIC...DHL picked up another part for us in Wisconsin on the same day and we received it today,
We will re think our shipping methods in the future, but what do they care"
"Garbage shipping company. Driver agreed to meet at the lobby of the building, turns out she went to the wrong building. She then purposely updated the shipment as incorrect delivery address and 4 days later, customer service ignored my request to pick it up from them. Horrible service, never use them."

I'd like to put one in less stars but there's nothing lower than 1 they got the worst drivers they don't know the difference between a gate and a door a I've never seen A bunch of incompetent drivers I don't even know how to stay in business or why big companies like Rogers who do want to do business with them A bunch of incompetent drivers I don't even know how to stay in business or why big companies like Rogers who do want to do business with them
"Purolator is by far the worst courier service. Unless you absolutely need to use their services, you will be better off looking elsewhere. Their couriers never bother delivering: they have a simple KPI to visit the address, but the sooner they leave, the sooner they can finish their job. So, if they need to get your signature and you live in an apartment building - bad luck, the courier won't waste their precious time waiting for you to go downstairs, they will just leave a sticker and make you do their job for them next day. Their customer support won't bother helping you."
"If i could give them 0 i would have done! What an absolute joke of a company. I arranged for a parcel to be collected, whilst i was on holiday in Canada and for it to be shipped back to the UK. Basically the collection never took place, no communication was provided by Purolator to advise me. I contacted their customer service and was told that i would need to either rearrange or get a refund, even though they didnt collect my parcel. They werent interested in that at all and just kept saying refund or rearrange. So i got my refund and sorted a new collection with DHL and pleased to say i now have my parcel.
As i said at the start if i could have given 0 stars i would have done, avoid this lot like the plague, dreadful"
Very often it's late
Had to cancel a trip because my new phone is and has been sitting in a wearhouse for weeks . Get the same excuses . Just do your jobs. 100%last time I ship or receive anything with purilator
"Liars and bad delivery service. Theres no point ordering through Purolator if you actually want it delivered to you. A half assed attempt would have been an overstatement they didnt even bother to follow delivery instructions, never contacted me that they were here. Just silently left a slip with ilegible writing and no pickup time or date. I rate vote less that 1 star if I could. These drivers need some actual standards and training"
"This is literally the worst experience you can face in Canada if you choose to have anything online. I had 4 different experiences with the same company and always there is an ""Unable to deliver"" with a non-sense reason the worst is no one cares about the customer and no one responds to your questions. Worst if there is an unable to deliver you need to expect another 4 to 7 days to be shipped. Another problem the company accepts Heavyweight shipping but you won't be getting your shipment because they need 2 agents and you need to wait days and days to have your package even if you need it."
Terrible service from the courier. He couldn't even bother to secure the pick-up notice on my door so I never knew were my package was until I found the notice a month later....

"I am supposed to receive my box today, I was at my home in a meeting and my son told that to the agent, he didn't even call me at my cell phone and left a message down on the reception asking me to go and take the box from one of the addresses they deal with. I ordered it to be received to my home because I don't have time to go to any place. I have tried to go down and catch the agent but he left quickly.
he can just make a try to call me at least. Purolator is the worst company , I hope I will not need to deal with them anymore."

I am supposed to receive 2 deliveries today. I got the 1 with Amazon delivery with no issues but 2nd package that's with purolator i missed. I was just sitting at home waiting for my deliveries but purolator does not give notifications or calls. The delivery guy didn't even press the doorbell i just got my notification from Amazon that i missed my package. I tried to call the customer service but no one answered for more than 10mins. Then i tried their chat service and got connected to an actual person whom pretended to get my info and then end the chat guising it as a technical error. I only Amazon can avoid using this company. So frustrating.

"Whenever I order something tracking says it gets as far as the Burnaby depot and from there it sits. Every day it says there is a 'delay in delivery due to external factors.' - for weeks. One order sat for almost 6 weeks and on repeated calls I got a different excuse every time - from bad weather in an unrelated area of the province, to that they don't deliver to my town (wrong). Customer service is abysmal."
"Purolator as they never deliver on time. I order 2 item using Amazon and I am supposed to get two deliveries on the same day and delivery time should 2 - 3 days. Although, Amazon person delivered the item on time but the Purolator says Address is wrong. How funny!! I used same transaction to order both item and both item has same address. Now it is like more than 7 days and I am still waiting."

"Total gong show. I’m surprised this company is still in business. Was supposed to get my package delivered Tuesday August 16/22 but apparently my address was missing my unit number - so far no problem even though they had my cell phone number and didn’t call me until the evening.

The lady left a nice message with a number to call and info req’d to complete delivery Wednesday August 17/22. I called and left voice message with the info - so far no problem.

Never showed up Wednesday and wasted my whole day. And instead of dropping it off at the store front depot 5 minutes from my home must’ve took it back to main depot - problem starting.

So I googled puralator Edmonton North and went there not knowing this wasn’t the real Edmonton North. Lady there was nice at first then became snarky and basically said we don’t know/can’t help phone Purolater.

I called there 1-888 number and was on hold for a while ~0.5 hr and gave up. Came back home and tried again from my land line ..... waited again for ~0.5 hr and finally talked to a person. I gave her the info I had already given in my voice mail. She entered it said it was all straightened out and gave me the option of home delivery Thursday August 17/22 or they would drop it at the store front and I could pick it up there.

Waited at home most of Thursday morning August 17/22 for delivery again no show. I checked my status and they scanned it this morning 7:03 am at the real Edmonton North at it showed - still waiting for address resolution. Same info I left in voice mail Tuesday nite and the girl said was corrected on Wednesday afternoon - now I’m really upset.

So again phoned the 1-888 number and had to wait ~20 minutes to talk to a person. I expressed my concerns than lost it when the lady couldn’t explain why no one responded to my numerous voice mails to 780.642.4424 and why the address problem wasn’t sorted out already. But after I let her have it said my parcel should be delivered tomorrow.

My cell number was on the shipping info so all they had to do is call me or check their voice mail and this whole situation could’ve been avoided.

I use Canada Post and this happened to me before. They left my package at their nearest store outlet and called me and I drove their in 5 minutes and got my package the day I was supposed to get it."

I was waiting for my package as its very important one.
All i get is a notification that the delivery was attempted and I missed it. Come on.. i was literally waiting for them to ring the buzzer, instead they just stick a notice on the door. Really a shame Purolator and your unprofessional staff. I wonder if they had the package in truck or just taking notices and sticking around. Whats the point of paying you?"

"Frustrating website and failed pickup after label created. Waited for 3 hours that I'm not getting back. Opted for a refund because shipment by stage coach is likely a better option. No cc refund, have to wait for a cheque in the mail. was also overcharged from $72.95 to $94.84 when $67.79 was supposed to be the actual rate. Found this out from Brennen B, who was great to deal with. Would avoid these guys at all costs. Look at the other reviews!"

"every time Amazon uses them to deliver my product and i ended up picking up myself at a Purolator store closed by or cancelling my order if is far. they have my buzzer number but they never use it, they only put a piece of paper by the front door and said they missed me that i wasn't home, but the fact is i work from home and expecting the package, and i have double checked if my buzzer was working properly and is perfectly fine. this has happened so many times and i am sure it has happened to others as well but the question is why are they still in business? they should be out of business or bankrupt! there are so many carrier companies out there and why people still using them? are they much cheaper perhaps?"

"I tried using the Purolator online auto assistant to arrange for a package pickup. After every step in the process, there was a several minute wait until I typed in “Are you still there?” after which the next prompt was given. When a pick up date and time was finally given, the auto assistant started all over, asking what I wanted? I called the company and was put on hold, only to have my call dropped after a few minutes of listening to Muzak and having the suggestion to use the auto assistant tossed at me several times. When I finally got through to a human being, she sounded like she absolutely hates her job. If Purolator treats its staff the way it treats its customers, I’m not surprised that the customer representative sounded so depressed. Fingers crossed my package will actually be picked up at the scheduled time."

"Paid for overnight delivery and they didn't even attempt to deliver the package, but the tracking said they came to my house. They didn't. Then they said they sent it out for redelivery but did not. I contacted them this morning and they said it would be a 2-day delay due to ""heavy volumes"". I asked if it would be easier to redirect to a more central location. The person sending was told that the delay was due to my asking for a redirect yesterday, which I did not, as I just asked for that this morning after being told about heavy volumes. They are either intentionally misleading consumers or their infrastructure is such that they are unaware as to when and if your packages will be delivered."

"Package has been sent out twice this week, both times delayed due to sorting error.

"Purolator attempted to deliver a package to my house. I had a previous appointment and left a note saying back in 1 hour. Trying to get it redelivered is not working. They will not give me a committed date or time. They want me to drive 80 miles to their pickup centre to pick it up. They say that because it is high value they cannot leave it with one of their approved drop off centres, but they say I can ship something of high value from the same centre. If they are related to Canada Post, why can't they drop it off at a local Canada Post Office. UPS, FEDEX and CANADA POST ALL have local drop off and pickup points. Why not Purolator? They say they are the largest in Canada, but they don't serve provide customer support to small communities of 60,000 people, like Comox Valley, Comox, Courtenay and Cumberland."

"I don't know why anyone uses Purolator in 2022 when they operate in last century techniques. Some orders I place (Best Buy etc) use these guys & every*single*time Purolator is a day late delivering, THEN leave a notice on my door that no one was home. I am home. They don't text, call, email or knock to get my attention. Just a note telling me to pick it up tomorrow. IF I HAD A CAR I WOULDNT BE ORDERING STUFF DELIVERED. Then, I wait 18 minutes on phone to get an attendant, another 8 to rectify the problem. I ordered this gaming headset for my grandsons 14th birthday. Will they be here before he leaves my house? Who knows. I only know i will never use purolator."

"From all the complains from the users, Purolator doesn't seem to fix the issue immediately.

I agree with people who said they didn't even make an attempt to contact the recipient. Trying chatting feature that lags most of the time and I had to relogin and chat with a different person which then repeating my question over and over again. Phone call? Well at least 15 to 20 mins to answer. I got a notification: ""Missed Delivery"" while they didn't even buzz my apartment number (they have it on file). Then left the ""missed delivery notification on the front door"". Fine then I picked it up myself while I didn't have a car and no bus available. After picking it up, I received a notification that the package was delivered. I am like excuse me? Who delivered it? It's best to mention that the recipient who PICK UP the package, not them who delivery it. Oh yes, btw, there is another option for us to choose: deliver the package with signature authorization, so they can leave the package in front of the door, and who knows who will steal it. Anyway, I am tired dealing with them... too bad there is no zero star option, one is too luxury!"

Deliver? Your driver's are leaving my packages in a wet STUMP at the end of my driveway. How is this acceptable This isn't the first time you've done this and my things are getting damaged and stolen! I'm still waiting for a call back from the complaint I made yesterday and the driver did the same thing today!!

"I had ordered some goods and the vendor used Purolator to ship it. Once the parcel arrived at the delivery depot it failed to deliver on two consecutive business days (they never even loaded it up on the delivery truck!) and on the third business day they decided to send the parcel back to the sender. The tracking system during those three days was absolutely awful, with confusing messages on the web, malfunctioning customer service chat system, and live operators where if you call three of them in the space of 10 minutes they would each give you a completely different description of the status of the shipment. I mean, I have never seen anything like this, what a truly awful experience. Use any shipping company but this one and you will do just fine."
"Have sign up asking for no knocking on door due to dog, Purolator driver completely triggered by this apparently as he started pounding on windows. I came outside and he started yelling, insulted me to say I could use the steps so should remove the sign, then called me a slur. My neighbour recorded part of it, I got a photo of his truck, emailed it already and no word back. Meanwhile he came back today and threw the package at the door until I came out taunting me with ""I thought you said you were calling the police"" and then took the package and left. Feel unsafe, and can't control if someone I buy from uses Purolator and scared for next time he comes back."
"I've never had any issues with Purolator before, until the last delivery of two computer systems purchased from Dell. I saw Purolator truck by the building, so I ran outside to pick up two boxes (the building's intercom didn't work). The driver inside didn't see me, so when he approached the door of the truck he just dropped the box on the floor. I told him that there was a computer system inside that box. He said that nothing is going to happen to it, and if something is wrong that he advised me to contact them. Since I was present there, he didn't drop the second box on the floor, the way he did with the first one. I've heard before stories how some Fedex or UPS drivers drop boxes, so it was kind of expected. It's understandable that that driver didn't care that he deals with other people's property (which can also be expensive), that it clearly said Dell on the box and there was a tag with product details on it, it didn't bother him that he can damage that property....it's clear that those things didn't bother him. But my question is, what does Purolator do about it? Any surveillance system in place? Or nobody cares about it over there either?"

"I bought PC items for 3000$ on NewEgg Canada and the carrier (Purolator) just delivered the package in front of my door on the road as I was not at home. The packages were obviously stolen. I contacted Purolator who told me to check with the neighbors or if the package was not carefully hidden by the carrier. This was not the case, and Purolator eventually confirmed that they just put the package not hidden at all, and that I needed to see with Newegg for next steps, that they could do nothing. End of the story : I issued 3 claims to Newegg, with a police report, they denied all. On its side, Purolator had the nerves to send me a survey to measure my satisfaction, but when I clicked on the link, I had a message saying that it was a mistake that they sent the survey to me."

"absolutely horrific experience. Purolator says that it needs apt number (i don't know why, i have never had similar issues before). I stayed home two days - they had the estimated delivery 1. august - nothing, 2 august and just after that they said that apt number has to be there.

its completely utter trash. Customer care nonexistent

EDIT:

after I contacted them after the reply, they just used the same template all over again. Customer support is clueless and cannot handle anything, so I don't know why they employ them. If you can, I recommend using other delivery methods."
There's nothing express about their express shipping. Never even received my last shipment...
Delivery person came to our home. We were home but did not hear a knock or the doorbell ring. They left a note on the door saying package will be sent to their office which will be about a 3 hour round trip from here. We live 10 minutes from one of their locations so why send the package to a different city? We are heading out of town tonight in the opposite direction. They will not hold the item till we get back. Some feedback: have the package for pickup at the local office or just ring the doorbell.

"Purolator is by far the most unreliable delivery service provider in Canada. Why am I still waiting on a very important package that was mailed via express, with a ""guaranteed"" next-day delivery? Contact customer service, and spoke with a manager to no avail. I've only received excuses. Now, I'm being penalized for your lackadaisical services. I should be compensated in some sort of way.

Purolator, please STOP offering services that you're not able to deliver! I would rather walk than use your services again!"

"Terrible service. They really don't bother delivering. I even saw the driver drive pass my house and deliver a package to my neighbour (hopefully that package was not mine because it would be the same size). I look at him while I'm ON the driveway and he enters his car and drives away. I let the first one go because there was a short banner across my driveway for new cement but has been dried already. I spent all fricken day in the garage waiting for him and that happened. I called to get it shipped today and to leave a note regarding driveway and still no package and now there's no update on tracking. Wt actual f. I'm so pissed, more because I waited all day outside and didn't get my package. I'm so tired stressing trying to get my packaged delivered, totally ruined my plans for the week. I called customer service twice today and they have no clue. 2 days Amazon prime? it's already been 9 business days since I ordered."
"We stayed home for the delivery (medical supplies). Driver apparently knocked on our basement door and concluded no one was home, we never heard them. Now we need to pick it up which is a 60km drive roundtrip, and within 5 business days too or else it will be returned to sender. Tip: when delivering in a rural area come around the back or honk or something."
"No company has ever had as much trouble finding an apartment door at a major city intersection than purolator. Can't get through an open glass front door? Oh well, package delivered! Don't have a buzzer code? No problem, delivery postponed! ....just...what...in the F&*^% hell are you people doing? Two deliveries missed in two days, than an angry employee calls me she's not there to argue with me, but yells at me anyway that she hasn't read the delivery info i gave to amazon and presumably all their couriers? ....you deserve to go out of business. Immediately. Unquestionably. This is disgraceful behavior and I am considering cancelling prime just so i don't run into any of you goons ever again. Ugh..."
Waiting for a package that is crucial to our business. Promised deliver July 21st. July 22nd (Friday) - I return home to a note on the door saying since I was not home I had to pick up the package at a local drop point on MONDAY after 1 pm. Go on Monday. No package. Go home to a SECOND note saying we missed you again and to pick it up tomorrow. I'll be leaving a note for the driver in case they try to deliver it again tomorrow.

"Haha I see we all share something in common here. I just experienced the worst delivery service of my life recently. I was curious if it was just a random bad experience, but a quick review search online and here I am!

Their system makes no sense for starters. I order express delivery. Pay $30. They deliver it next day and send me a text. Okay great start. Then a follow up text with a link saying I can sign off for delivery. Click the link to a page that says ""package requires signature"", but no way to sign or contact driver. So I miss my delivery and get the pick up slip saying it will be held for 5 days at this location, pick up after 1pm tomorrow. Not a big deal. The next day I go to work and get another text they are redelivering my package! Again, I can't sign remotely or contact the driver on short notice to give permission to leave on my doorstep. I get another pickup slip, item will be held for 5 days again. Then my package ends up being delayed and connection missed between the last failed delivery and transport to locker. A day later it ends up being sent back to the airport on the other side of the city?!? So I just paid 30 bucks for them to drive my package around the city and not even being able to pick it up. I requested a re-delivery and asked if they could at least give me an estimate date of arrival and I can leave a note for delivery driver. The request was accepted but the re-delivery never happened. A week went by and package returned to sender. Lol what just happened!"
I have a tracking number but they never update their tracking system. What's the point in having tracking at all if they don't use it. I should have had my package today but it hasn't arrived and I have no idea where it is because they don't update their tracking system. I guess I will never get my package. Never trust Purolator.
"They said they delivered my package ( a kayak ) and the gps confirms it. I was THERE when they notified me my package arrived and nothing. After I asked to open an investigation the only response I got was that it wasn't their fault and they were closing the investigation. 40 minutes on the phone later I managed to talk to a human and after he ""reopened"" the case I got a copy/paste email closing the case... no kayak for this summer for me. Thanks purolator"
"Awful delivery service. Drivers don't actually put effort to deliver the parcel. They just update tracking status to 'Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible'. WHY DO YOU EVEN SPEND GAS FOR VEHICLES? Your drivers burn that gas for no reason - NO delivery happens! Ridiculous.
I experienced the failed deliveries of two packages in a row in just past two weeks. Today got an email from another seller saying that they shipped by Purolator, and I'm again worried about the terrible delivery service and potential delays.
Wish sellers used other more reliable delivery services."
"They are the worst. I walked in with a package around 11am on Thursday and explained that I have a package for someone travelling to Europe on Saturday. Can you guarantee delivery to Whitby Ontario about an 1Hr 30mins minutes from me(Barrie, Ontario) They said yes, express service. Guaranteed to be delivered by 12pm. I waived signature just to make sure they don't take it back to their depot.

Lets just say I should have just fueled my tank with the $37 I gave to this knob heads. They sent package to different route, missed delivery date. I had beg them to terminate delivery and bring my package back, since recipient already left the country. Still trying to get my money back. Multiples calls, they gave me lots of run around. Eventually they agreed on a refund, the claimed to have sent a check, still waiting."

"This is the worst courier service in the world! They don't attempt to actually deliver, and if they come to your door, they don't bother to ring the doorbell or leave it in the porch, instead they will just put a sticker on the door and ask to collect the parcel from their depot. Why are they in business?? I don't experience this with UPS or Canada Post."

"I received an email that stated that the Purolator delivery person could not access my building, so they could not make a delivery.

I have no idea of what the access issue was, but I contacted them when I received the email notification, and requested that they send the shipment to a depot for pickup. Their representative advised that it would be available for pickup on July 12th. I attended their depot five times in the period from July 12th to the 19th, each time surprised that it still had not arrived.

This is FOR AN INTERNAL SHIPMENT from Purolator depot to Purolator depot within the same city.

I have spent hours on this shipment, on the phone, on line, and on the road. Still, nothing.

In future, I will not do business with those who ship via Purolator, will not use them to ship items for myself, and will advise you to do the same."

"I don't know why you guys even offer tracking, honestly. Love being informed that my road is closed when I live on this road and can tell you it's not. Love delays due to extreme weather on sunny, beautiful days. Love being told my package is delivered when no delivery vehicle even came to my house and the best y'all can do is shrug your shoulders even though YOU APPARENTLY TOOK IT UPON YOURSELVES TO SIGN FOR MY NON-DELIVERED PACKAGE. How you're still in business is beyond me; you must be offering rock bottom rates for companies to still use you when you're this disgustingly incompetent and dishonest.

"I had/have an Amazon order that was supposed to be delivered yesterday, July 18th. I was home. Nobody rang my buzzer. No phone call. the same thing the following day. The tracking info said both times Incorrect address. I've been living here 25 years. This is 2nd time in 2 months this has happened with Purolator. The first time, my order arrived out of the blue with 0 tracking info. It was just lucky I was home at the time. I guess all of a sudden, my address wasn't incorrect. Most incompetent company I've ever experienced in the delivery business. I never have a problem with UPS, Canada Post or FedEx...just Purolator. Terrible service. And when I called their 1-800 line, I asked for some help and received a wishy washy response. They couldn't tell me if or when it would be delivered. So I asked for the depot's phone #, and they said they don't have it. LOL! What a joke. I even offered to go pick it up, but no, I can't do that. Aiy yai yai. What a company!!

July 20th....After a day of headaches of trying to get my delivery, it finally arrived. A nice lady at Purolator must have worked some magic, because it arrived just after noon today. Today's delivery driver was miffed about the other 2 drivers (I gather 2 drivers from the trip info I had), that couldn't figure out how to ring my buzzer or even find my building. Anyway, he had it together, so all is now good in that respect. But, there is still the ongoing problem of communication between the seller, the buyer (me), and Purolator. There seemed to be no avenue for me or the other 2 parties to actually talk to each other to add info onto the order and straighten things out. I suggested to the nice lady at Purolator that they should maybe make some changes in protocol's for when deliveries go off the rails. In the end, Purolator did come through, but it was a rocky road to make it happen."

"Purolator worst company ever, 91% owned by Canada Post. Ottawa West Purolator always claiming my address is wrong when address is in fact correct. Notifications say attempted delivery in Ottawa west.. Duh! Keep on attempting delivery when I'm not even located in Ottawa, so where in the F*** are they trying to deliver it to??? Why don't yous hire some people that can read??? So fed up with purolator F****** up all the time. Get a new CEO / Manager, Everyone should start calling Canada Post head Office to complain because speaking to anyone at Purolator falls on deaf ears."

"3 on 3 packages lost. Avoid using this company.
And Delphine? Don't bother copy pasting your usual message because you have effectively convinced everyone that your company is not worth the time."
"I would give zero stars if I option was available. I paid extra for express services, the parcel get delivered late and a month later I still don't have my refund after wasting my working hours calling them."
They can never deliver my package i hate this company I dont even think they get out of thier van to deliver anything I wish amazon could find another company to deliver like use fed ex or dhl anything but horrible purlator worst company and laziest workers to exsist how are they still in buisness .. crazy
"I wouldnt even give them a 1 star if I could.
My work was sending a computer from Ontario to calgary, AB.
I did use the tracking, and on July 6( my birthday to boot) I waited all day. I tried to use their automated system and all that stated was ""its on the way""
I then hold for 1/2 hour to be told it's coming at 10:30 the next day.
Low and behold, it's now 3PM and still no package.
Not even a time frame????
I call and ask for an agent only to be told that it's on the truck, and they work 8 hour shifts, so it should be there by 4:30, but the timeframe is 8-8.
This has been an extreme burden. My mom is in the hospice, with a rare cancer and will die anyday now... and Im stuck in my house!!!!
Afraid to go the bathroom, as they might show up at that minute.
Can they not give a time frame? Get with the times....
Next step...BBB.
Worst service ever.
If you can use an alternative, I'd strongly suggest it.
And To the folks at Purolator... I strongly believe in Karma. To all those involved in this I wish this on you."

"If you want your package to arrive late or not arrive at all this is the best company. Never on time, always delayed deliveries. Do your job well once, if you can't handle the amount of shipments then don't accept them!! Terrible company"
"Purolator lost two of my shipments in the past 6 months. Total value lost is about $3000. One was never scanned by the driver on pickup so there is no tracking in the system. The other was delivered to an AMAZON facility instead of the intended recipient! In both cases, they could not locate the package and all we got was an apology."

"This is the first and LAST time i will ever use or ever recommend to anyone to use Purolator. I paid $500.00 to transport items and they arrived at a warehouse in my neighborhood 4 days ago but purolator local stores are not able to cummunicate with the warehouse in which i was willing to pick up my items as the warehouse doesn't deliver on weekends even though the stores of purolator are open. As such i was made to wait an extra 4 days (over and above the initial 3 days to transport it from 1 province away initially). Then to make matters worse i was informed by their tracker it left their warehouse in my neighbourhood less than 3 miles from my home and was informed it is en route. I'm currently at 5 more hours and still waiting for it to arrive when i could walk that distance there and back in less time. The ABSOLUTE worse service i have ever seen and no communication within their own departments is just another reason why their service is terrible, if i could give 0 for a rating i would have."
"I’d give a 0 if able. A shipping company that can’t use an intercom. But somehow 3 days in a row attempts made about 7:20-7:40am. I work from home and my intercom is connected to my cell phone. Neither were called at those times. So I put a note on the intercom, with code and number. Also still working from home, no buzz no call but a delivery attempt at 8am. Glad I paid for 2 day shipping to be still waiting 4 days later. Absolutely no f*cks given by this company and it’s staff 0/out of any rating system"

WORST SERVICE EVER 😒 I WAIT ALL DAY YESTERDAY FOR MY PARCEL. HE CAME IN TO MY BUILDING NEVER RING THE INTERCOME HE LEFT A NOTICE BY THE MAIL ROOM HAD THE NERVE TO SAY NOBODY WAS HOME.

"Two days in a row excuses have been made saying that they didn't have the buzzer code or that I was not home when I have been sitting at home waiting for them. No delivery card notices were left either day.There is onsite building management that the parcel could have been left with. Clearly the driver is lazy and is not even attempting delivery. This is the type of service I got from UPS. It seems Purolator just does not care anymore. I would rather have things delivered by Canada Post as your item will be there when you get home in a safe, secure, locked parcel box."
If I could rate this a zero I would. My package is a week late and everytime i call they tell me that it’s arriving today. The driver has zero reason to not deliver it. It’s been on a truck for days. Horrible service and horrible help

"If I could give zero stars, believe me I would, I've dealt with Purolator twice and twice they have claimed my address is wrong, then it takes 2-3 days to fix an address that was right to begin with, never again, I will go out of my way to may sure Purolator isn't the shipping agent."

I checked my parcel and it shows my buzzer code on it so that was not the issue. Very upsetting."

"Second time complaining about this they claimed they couldn’t gain access to my building the time was posted as 9.15am i was actually in the front entrance theres one main door between 8.30 am and 9.30am as I was waiting for a relative. during that time there were 3 plus deliveries from amazon and one from ups I know i let them in in fact one person was on the phone to the person he was delivering to. Honestly Purolator do something about your ratings look at it ! No Puraltor person came by unless i was in a time warp.. Also this is the second time complaint about this delivery because i have racked up 15 not delivered in two years! I get deliveries from Amazon every other day. Never an issue.

thanks. I now will be selective of anything I purchase in terms of who their delivery service is, I wont be buying products that use purolator"

TERRIBLE customer service. I would give 0 starts if possible. Decided to put my package on the truck for apparently 40 mins and then take it off without delivering it.

If i saw the review here before i was not gonna repeat the mistake to reorder .For the rest of order i ask them to giving to by hand i was told they cannot see that one in the system even with the tracking number from them. They don't have no responsibility if the driver lie ,it's your loss . Please stop taking your time to respond by the usual BS , just do the right thing , your job correctly"
"Hi Larsen, thank you for taking the time to write this review. If you need an item to require a signature so it is handed to the receiver you need to make this request with the sender.

"Worst delivery company in existence. Its a simple as that. I live in an apartment building and purolator can’t figure out how to get a a package delivered to me. This has happened many times the tracking always says missed delivery but they never buzz my apartment when they arrive they just leave a note for it to be picked up at a courier location. If no one notifies me that they are at the building by buzzing my apartment how am I suppose to know they are here? Must I perform a divination ritual to sense when they are nearby? Maybe l’ll try the force next time. Anyone who has had them deliver through Amazon I urge you to call Amazon and tell them how bad of service purolator is maybe they will drop them as a client and this company can finally go out of business. I have no idea how a company so incompetent can function. You have over 4500 reviews purolator and almost all of them are 1 star. Figure it out.

"Tried to return an Amazon package and unfortunately my only option was Purolator. My package was delivered to the wrong shipping dock at Amazon. All they had to do is ship my package from Etobicoke to the Mississauga dock which is literally 30 min away. Clearly they do not care to read the shipping label. After seeing several similar terrible reviews for Purolator, I will not make any future purchases online if the delivery partner is Purolator."

"It has happened with just about everything that has ever been sent to me via Purolator and it happened again....I was not home on the first date of attempted delivery. The next day I was home all day and a redelivery is ""attempted""....meaning the delivery driver just clicks his pad and says no one there to receive the parcel. I bet Purolator has the highest failed delivery attempts in the business because drivers dont even attempt they just claim too. Why businesses continue to use such a poor service is beyond me."

"To whom it may concern:

I write this letter with the intention for Recognition of Service well done!!
Managers please be advised, employees working the front desk at Purolator at Squires Beach Road Pickering location, in particular one person that I had dealings with on two separate occasions. LISA has outstanding customer service, interpersonal skills and highly unusual in this day and age, she genuinely cares!! Lisa’s attention to detail and problem-solving skills were used to track a package that was misdirected to Amazon. I was shipping this package for my cousin from PICKERING to Ottawa- 1day delivery. The package never arrived. An investigation was initiated by my cousin from Ottawa, only to be closed, result being LOST!! However that investigator and I know her name is Margaret, (do not misunderstand, that is my name as well) Margaret, the investigator had NOT even called the Squires beach location that the package was shipped from nor did Margaret speak to anyone from the Squires Beach location. Two weeks later, I decide to go to the Squires Beach location and speak to Lisa. I had no idea they closed the investigation until this point. We spent an hour together calling Amazon, Lisa remembered placing the package in a Purolator bag that is deemed for Amazon deliveries. Lisa spent her time tracking phone numbers and speaking to an Amazon representative who was extremely helpful and determined to locate the package. The package was located and delivered to Ottawa the very next day.
Here’s the timeline: May 31st Shipping package to Ottawa, June 10, the investigation was canceled by investigator, Margaret
June 15 th Lisa’s investigation from Squires Beach location, package found and delivered to Ottawa
June 16th package received by customer in Ottawa.
Thank you very much Lisa! Thank you for caring enough to spend time during a busy morning. Lisa’s skill set and work that ethic is not being utilized to her full potential, in my humble opinion!
Since it was my responsibility to ship this package to Ottawa for my cousins I am feeling so much better that I was also able to help them in locating the package. This would not have happened had I not gone to Squires Beach Road and spoke directly with Lisa the original contact person. You need to train your investigators to be efficient, care & hire investigators with problem-solving skills.

Margaret Panchuk for my cousins in Ottawa"
"I've been receiving a shipment dropped off to my home address that is not ours (Not the previous home owners shipment as well). When I contacted the customer service for pick up, they asked us to contact the sender (no one picks up the call), and figure out the correct address so they can ship it to them. No call reference number provided to the conversation as well. Not happy with the customer service. I guess I have to keep throwing the shipment that's coming through in garbage till I live in this house. Even when I mentioned, I could drop it off at the nearest location, they said it would not be an option and it would be shipped right back to our house. They did not seem to care about the shipment at all."

"I ""dread"" being informed packages have been shipped by Purolator. Further ""complaints fall on deaf ears"" because they get away with it. I have been waiting for a package several times only to find a door tag no answer when I was home all the time expecting delivery. There are days when our building entrance is plastered with ""Missed You"" tags pick up next day @! Our local driver must write all the tags as soon as he leaves the depot. Neighbors have all conferred indicating they were home but ""not contacted!"". One neighbor was livid after seeing the driver come to the building as he watched for the truck, he could see the driver walk to the door but not see him at the door, seconds later he walked back to his truck. The neighbor went downstairs to check his mail immediately after and found three ""missed you stickers on the door"" he buzzed the three units and asked if they had been contacted? each unit said no they were home waiting and no one buzzed them. They then had to wait 24 hrs. for next day pick up which is especially infuriating when you have paid for next day 24 delivery for your package, knowing if Purolator deliver it it will instead be 48 hours because you will have to pick up at their drop office. Worst thing is people keep using them because they think they are ""A reputable company"" they need to suffer bankruptcy in the worst way!"

on hold for 45mins 2 days in a row due to their screw ups. First they didn't receive the address properly...then it got corrected and I called and confirmed and it went through. Then told the next day it didn't go through until 6pm the night before. So package won't be delivered. Then the driver is lazy and doesn't even try the next time and drops it off at the post office. Major inconvince for me being disabled without proper ID and horrible owners of the post office are foreign and cause alot of issues. Never again and I also suggested to rogers to stop using them cause they're horrible. The problem wasnt the address. It was Purolator telling me it was being delivered and then telling it's at the post office. Go to post office it's not there. Call again and they say it wasn't delivered at all...then they tell me once again I have to schedule for redelivery...AGAIN. I've done this three days now. The address was fixed the first day. So don't give me your stupid replies.

"I don’t understand how such a big company as Purolator don’t have the capability of automatic system for pick up, same way it used to be. Their excuse is that they are still working on that. Really? For so many months?? I guess they’re hiring elementary students as IT. I actually believe that elementary students would be able to fix that way faster. You literally need time off from work in order to have the time for their customer service to answer. Very very bad service. I guess they don’t mind when they’re loosing business. Too bad, especially in these days when every company should try to keep the business. I’m sure they don’t care , otherwise they would do something about"

"Not too happy about the pickup information.
They left me a note where i could pick up my parcel. It was supposed to be a store close to where i live. So i went to the store today to collect it but to my surprise my parcel was not there! I then received a call from a different location much farther away from where I live saying that my parcel is at their store..! Now i have to figure out when and how to get there because i have a tight schedule. The lady i talked to was nice and said she could transfer my parcel to the closer store but there would be no guarantee how many days it would take more because from what she said, they store it at the warehouse before moving it again.
What i mean to say was why not dropping off the parcel at the store's address stamped on the note🤷‍♀️."

The worst delivery company ever - There is no responsibility for customer service and there is no one to respond. Never Never use that for your shipment and delivery services.

An extreme stupid in this field. Their virtual assistant option is a total stupid. No coordination between the schedule for pick up and original time the personnel come to pick up. Extremely unprofessional. I wish I could give no star and some minus points.

"Supervisor lied to me saying Purolator is not responsible to deliver my order to my property. So basically they can leave it on the street and claim it was delivered.

Meanwhile, Wayfair kept saying they should deliver it to the unit. The end result is I had 2 massive boxes weighting 200lb in total, sitting on the lobby of my condo, without having a way to bring it upstair.

Edit to answer the automated answer below from Purolator: I have already talked to 3 supervisors, plus Wayfair and no solution was offered. My doorman was kind enough to help me bring the massive box to the apartment. I wonder what would happen if I was elderly or had reduced mobility. The lack of care with the customers is out of this world and I wonder how this company is still doing business."

"Wouldn't have shipped with Purolator but the site I was buying from didn't give me a choice unfortunately. I live in an apartment and the buzzer number for our unit is written with the buzzer along with my surname and apartment number but nobody ever buzzed (someone was home all day to pick it up) OR left a slip giving a pickup location. Only found out a delivery was ""attempted"" after an alert from a third party package management app (NOT Purolator's app) mentioned it. Customer service chatbot didn't function on my computer or phone for unknown reasons (disabled all my blockers and anti trackers, tried incognito, nothing) so had to use spouse's computer and then phone, still not sure if a pickup can be scheduled as the delivery ""attempt"" was apparently after opening hours. Not to mention that the tracking seems to be saying it's in a city 2 hours away, which it better not be as I do not have a vehicle!

Will see if pickup can be arranged but this is not my first terrible experience with this company - a few years ago I ordered an important medical device only for the driver to buzz in and then leave before the buzzer even finished ringing (spouse saw them leave out an overlooking window) and had to run down the stairs to stop him, when he was halfway across the road by then (and not on a crosswalk, on top of everything else). Thought that maybe they had improvedsince then but maybe not.

Avoid."

"Purolator manages to fail every time I use it. On three separate occasions Purolator failed to deliver the package and I was obliged to go to their facility to pick up the goods. Couriers never call when they are not able to deliver due to various reasons. Phone number is always available, they just choose not to call. In fact, I'm not even sure if they ever try to deliver, as I'd receive packages on the same day from other couriers. The worst service ever."
"Horrible company. Package delayed many days due to multiple missed connections and mechanical delays. If I had known they were shipping from Purolator, I would have purchased from someone else."
"Every time I have a shipment coming from Purolator it has never been delivered. It's always a door delviery slip left. I live in a condo tower, yesterday June 2nd, my wife and myself were home and expecting a package to be delivered as advised by tracking notification. Well, I found the delivery notice in the mail room ""We're sorry we missed you"". The driver never called us. Our entrance phone is connected to our cell phones, both of us, one call missed on the primary phone, it goes to the secondary phone. My wife received a text from Purolator June 3rd stating package is available now for pick up in Richmond, we live in New West. The delivery slip says the package is available for pick up in New West, confusion or what. This is typical of Puraltor, I don't kmow how they stay in business.

John M

Delphine, I appreciate the follow up, but it does not matter at this point. In the end I had to make to stops to pick up my shipment, New Westminster and then drive to Richmond to pick up the second piece. Not to mention the waste of fuel, but the two hours I had to give up to pick up my goods. If you want the tracking number email the request and I will supply it. But the matter is closed for me.

"The worst experience I’ve ever had. I’m actually laughing. They sent my package to a different city! They have confirmed that’s it’s lost and there’s nothing they can do. They told me to contact the eBay seller to get a new one! They offer no compensation considering they sent it to a different city. Apparently it was “delivered to my door” what a lie! Not even the same city, nor does that city have the same street name lol. The “chat” on their site is the worst as well. Don’t even bother with that. I’ve literally had one experience with purolator and it was this. No wonder the reviews are so bad. I never leave reviews but I had to for this because it’s so bad and if of of their “quality control people” try to respond to this, save your PR. You’re garbage."
Its like they purposely do everything in their power to aggravate you off intentionally and make every little complication they can think of. Absolutely ridiculous

"Horrible experience. I ordered a product on May 26th. The package was meant to be delivered on May 31st. At around 10:41 am, the tracker mentioned it was on a vehicle for delivery, then was later updated around 4:18 pm, with ""Attempted delivery - packaging issue"". So, no delivery driver showed up at my door, which I would've been aware of as I have two very loud dogs, and was watching for them all day.

After trying to call Purolator to figure this out, I was on hold for about 30 minutes without an answer. That hold song is infuriating. Next, tried to use the online chat which was also a nightmare, as it did not work with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, and finally worked with Firefox. To talk to a person, you have to explicitly tell the bot that you'd like to speak to a person multiple times.

Finally, once I was connected to a real person, after giving them some sensitive information, they told me that the package wasn't able to be delivered due to damage. They mentioned that this would be sorted out by Purolator soon and would update the tracker.

That same night, at around 6:55 pm, the tracker was updated with ""Resolution required - shipment refused"". Then, the following morning the tracker was updated at 6:48 am with the same message.

After speaking with the online chat again, I was told that I personally had declined the package because I deemed the package damaged. How could I have possibly denied the package if I never saw the package because it was never attempted to be delivered to my home?

What's going on here Purolator? Did your driver assume that no one was home because there weren't any vehicles in the driveway and skip delivering to my home, and then give some bogus excuse as to why it wasn't delivered? I was also denied the ability to go in and pick up my package in person. The online chat said there was no possible way for me to pick it up in person. They also told me that I'd have to reach out to my seller, to get them to issue a replacement.

Why is it that your driver did not attempt to deliver, then lied about me saying the package was damaged? Why was I denied access to view my package, and see if it is damaged or not? If the box is damaged, I could care less! Now I have to go through my seller and go through this entire waiting process again. The seller also told me to pick up the replacement in person at Purolator, but the problem is Purolator already said this wasn't possible.

Do better Purolator. It's actually sad how horrible this experience has been. My packages from across the world, in China, which was ordered after my package with Purolator, made it to my home before Purolator could deliver a package that is 30 minutes away from my home.

I'd honestly give -5 stars if I could."

"Horrible customer service.
Very rude and they're confused.
I asked a purolator driver that I saw by my work what time they deliver until.
He gave me totally different time than the lady I spoke with on the phone.
I see why businesses fall apart and close.
It's their employees that drive potential customers away.
I will ""NEVER"" use purolator again..."

"Useless people working in the tracking department, couldn't care less! On hold for 2 hours before I finally hung up. My package still sitting in the depot, it has been a week now because they screwed up on the waybill at the collection. The women working in the tracking department Tanya and Chrysa refused to return my phone call and they refused to contact the shipper store for the additional information they needed so I had to do that job for the both of them. And still no delivery scheduled. They should both be fired."
This is the worst company for delivery. They made a mistake with my address and there was no way to join them and fix it. Always redirected me to their online chat (which has been developed by a monkey). This chat is the worst. It never works! If you want your package without having to go through all of this stay away from this company

"just terrible. i watched my item sitting in limbo for 3 daya at one of their sort facilities. on the 4th day it finally updated to saying item delayed due to missed connection. really, its been there for 3 days and it missed its connection??? im on day 3 since then, item is still sitting at that toronto sort facility....

Update: I did get an update per below from Purolator customer service that my shipment is delayed because it is oversized and heavy, and requires special handling. I'm still disappointed but admit I am satisfied with at least knowing what's going on. If Purolator had put this explanation in the tracking notes with an honest realistic delivery date instead of just always updating that it will be delivered tomorrow letting me down day after day I would not have been so pissed off to begin with"
"I got a text message to go pick up my package at 1:11pm, but when I got to the counter around 4:10pm, I was told that there was no package as the driver picked it up by error for delivery.
So when I got home without any news, I went to check The tracking online, and found out that t says the was missing info for delivery at 4:02pm in the system!? How could the driver say that there is missing info for delivery if he decided to take the package for delivery… to what address?
I checked the delivery address and there is no info missing!!!
This is the worst delivery service ever, so I still don’t understand why they are still in business and why companies continue to use Purolator?"

Amazon switched to only taking returns via Purolator. This has resulted in me no longer using Amazon. Purolator in North Vancouver is a very inconvenient location with difficult parking. Returning items from Amazon is no longer an option.

If there would be a zero stars I would definitely give a zero to this company!!!!! Left the directions for the driver in North Van to call once at the door. No calls no nothing he just left a note. I lost a day from work just waiting for them to deliver the package. That driver should be fired for don’t do his job!!! And it’s not a first time happened. FedEx UPS are the best companies to go with. Even. Canada Post is even better 100 times! Purolator shouldn’t be even existing.

"Worst shipping company ever. This is the second time I had a purchase shipped with Purolator and both times the package was delayed. The first time there was no reason provided or an update for expected delivery date until just before the package was delivered. The package contained Mother’s Day Gifts and since they were 4-5 days late they didn’t arrive for Mother’s Day which left my children disappointed when they didn’t have gifts to give their grandma and Mom.

I am still waiting for my second package that was supposed to arrive on May 27th and then updated to May 30th (today). The package contained bathing suits my daughter really wanted for our Great Wolf Lodge trip. I went on last night to see if they had been delivered to the warehouse so I could pick them up knowing we were leaving at 11am. There was still no update but yet they were supposed to be delivered today. I went on again this morning, still no update.

My daughter is extremely disappointed she won’t have the new bathing suits she picked for our trip. They have now wrecked 2 special occasions for us because of their terrible shipping and lack of updates."
"I am extremely disappointment and angry at the service received from Purolator. Your whole “It’s not just a package it’s a promise” is a joke. I went to the Purolator office in London, Ontario on May 19, 2022 to send a package to my mother who was in Burlington visiting my sister. It contained her medications. I asked the representative if it was okay to do that and she indicated yes as long as it’s in Canada.
It was suggested that I sen it to the depot in Burlington where my sister could pick it up between the hours of 8 to 8 because of her job she would not be at home when package might arrive said great let’s do that. I paid left the store thinking everything was okay. I checked my email the next day while driving to Ottawa only to see the update stating that the Purolator driver missed the connection and now the package wouldn’t be available for pick up until the 24th.

Not acceptable as package needed to get to my mother urgently. I called customer service and was left on hold for 30 minutes until a Representative named Shelley answered. May I just say not a pleasant person from the get go. I explained situation she said package was sitting on a truck somewhere didn’t know exactly where. She also said it was showing that it was going to be sent to a Purolator outlet at some variety store and because it was a long weekend they wouldn’t be open till the 24th which was Tuesday. I explained to her that It was supposed to have been taken to the depot and that there hours were 8 to 8. I did this because it was going to be easier for my sister who was picking it up.

I also explained the seriousness of the situation as my mother needed her medication or she very well would end up in the emergency department without it. She typed up the message and sent it wherever. It did no good as I received an email shortly after stating that due to unforeseen situation the package wouldn’t be available until the 24th. Unbelievable!!!

I contacted my sister who then had to contact the pharmacist and plead with him to redo medication. Let’s just say he was less than impressed quite annoyed. We than had to ask a elderly family friend to pick up meds before they closed and drive them to Branford where my sister met her halfway. My mom ended up giving her $40 for gas. So on top of the charge to Purolator it cost her $$ not to mention the gas, time and stress this caused all of us.

Will not use your company again and will not recommend it to anyone either.

Horrible horrible service. Sat in Toronto for 9 days and didn’t move. On expected delivery date tracking stated it missed network connection so was delayed. New Expected date of delivery was today which is impossible since its still in Toronto and it’s coming to Vancouver. So I call and am told it will take four days once it leaves Toronto so the earliest is may 31. The tracking system doesn’t give accurate information and should indicate what city they are missing network connection. I’m contacting DELL to suggest they find another service. This is the third incident of incompetence. The last laptop they lost the computer after weeks of delay.

What a dishonest company.
Made me wait all day for a VERY IMPORTANT package, all to receive an email that I was unavailable. WHAT A LIE! The delivery never came. I was home all day specifically for this. And I have cameras. No one was there.
Chatted with a customer service representative who was apologetic but REALLY NOT HELPFUL. DO NOT USE PUROLATOR for medical equipment, urgent an important packages and letter. It seams they do this trick quite often. It’s a matter of time they will go out of business.
I will be spreading this info to all the businesses I deal with, important pharmaceutical companies, payroll companies, everyone! There are much better alternatives than these LIARS! ZERO STAR IF IT WAS POSSIBLE!"

Not an option until tomorrow, says it’ll be delayed to tomorrow anyways. And I can’t even ask them to mark it as urgent cus the driver can just decide whether they treat it urgently or not.

"I just got finished writing a review for the worst courier I have ever experienced and realized I have never wrote one for the best courier service I have ever experienced. What was shocking was seeing that 95% of reviews for Purolator are negative. Come on people stop harping on the one bad experience you've had and saying nothing about the good experiences.
Purolator has been the most reliable courier I have ever had the pleasure of having my Amazon/Dell orders shipped to me by. 99.9% of all orders Purolator has had a hand ion delivering to me have arrived 1-2 days early and the other 0.1% have showed up on the day they were supposed to arrive. In all the years (since 1994) I have had packages delivered by Purolator I have never had any legitimate reasons to make a complaint towards them. Intelcom could learn a great deal from Purolator's example."
"I ordered two monitors that were shipped as separate packages with Purolator Quick Ship. They were erroneously labeled as 51lbs. each so I guess the driver decided it was too heavy to deliver and noted ""Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible"" even though no delivery attempt was made. I received a much lighter (but larger) package from Purolator around the same time delivered to my door with no issues at all. Also, it has been 27 days and they still haven't returned the packages to the sender."

For example, my package currently ""missed a connection"" which I don't understand how this happens but, it's been 5 days and today's Friday 5/20/22 and the website claims the delivery is today but the package is sitting in Ottawa while I live in London (approximately 5-6 hours away)

As a developer to the owners of Purolator or whomever manages the digital department, I would consider adding more logic to the shipping date, as of right now my package is in Ottawa, i'm in London and there's no way in heck it's making it to my house.

Generally speaking on the delivery service as a service, it's very slow, obviously has some flaws in their methods of delivery and management of brick and mortar shipping hubs and fails to accurately provide even close shipping times, needless to say, this will be my absolute last time using Purolator.

Edit: They helped me figure out the situation with the package, the delayed sucked but the product got here safely and it was a quick transition.. was worried about having to claim it."

This company is absolutely horrible. They lie constantly stating that delivery attempts have been made when they clearly have not. I have cameras all around the front of my house! Amazon needs to stop using this delivery service as they are completely unreliable and lie constantly. I don't want people to lose jobs but this company deserves to go out of business. By the way this has happened to me on multiple items and deliveries.

"Just terrible.

I ordered a sofa 2 weeks ago and it was send via Purolator.

First, there was some ""Mechanical delay"" so the shipment was delayed, then on the day of supposed delivery tracking status changed to ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"". Which is just not true, I was there the whole day and nobody tried to deliver anything - nobody buzzed, called or left Delivery Attempt Notice.

So, I called support line and was told that next delivery attempt is tomorrow. Then I called next day and was told that it's tomorrow again. Then I called again and was told that it's heavyweight shipment so it requires 2 drivers to deliver and the second driver isn't available right now and nobody got any Idea when he will be."
"Where is the zero stars - honestly everyone is right how are they still in buisness. Seems Best Buy uses purolator for their deliveries now, worst decision ever I will never shop at Best Buy or use this incompetent company ever. Hope this helps someone."
Driver never ring the bell!!! All I received every time is “Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable” when I’m at home waiting for the package. What a liar. The purpose of each delivery is just to leave you a notice for self pickup. Sometimes I don’t even see the notice. Very bad experience!

"How is this company still in business? literally have had problems with the last 4 packages that got ""delivered"" by them. I really do not understand how this company is still standing with this many 1 star reviews and its clearly not BS since I've been threw the ringer on the last 4 packages. Like small simple items. If you can I would avoid using them for absolutely anything."

"Absolutely garbage. Was told by Purolator after the first ""attempt"" of delivety I needed to pick it up at a location. I THEN had to call on my lunch break to reschedule delivery. (This is furniture, not something I can carry home)
Had to have my phone on and watch it all day at work only to receive an email stating that yes my package went out for delivery but would be another 2 days. The pickup location was less than 1km from my residence.
Guys there IS A SOLUTION! IF you are ordering from Amazon call thier AMAZING customer service and tell them to take PUROLATOR as a delivery service OFF YOUR ACCOUNT. We have a PUROLATOR delivery idiot on our cc tv at our building leaving a huge package against the glass doors that shattered and he just walked away. SERIOUSLY PUT THIS COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!"
"Zero stars absolutely zero stars… worst company ever. I will avoid Purolator at any cost. I needed my package for Monday but guess what?

"If there was 0 i would of picked that.
Still waiting for a Company Laptop shipped out from Coquitlam to Rossland Apr 28th.
It is Now May 16th. I have filed complaints, talked to Supervisors...and no F'n Laptop.
Honestly how can they charge for a service that dont provide. Horrible all around.
Update: now they ask for my tracking number to help me omg lol sorry PURO I have spent literally hours dealing with your constant repetitive fake promises.
NO ONE CAN HELP.
Do you get that????????
How many times do I have to call, sit on the phone, go over the story again and again and again and again……..no just stop and don’t bother.
Literally NOT ONE SINGLE THING has helped us to date.
Go ask your Supervisors, there is a thick file on this one. His name is Matt.
Oh and another fact- My Company had to send ANOTHER Laptop out because we are not getting the one we sent!!!!!
But don’t worry, we used FedEx this time, and will be using them every time."

They take complaint, give ticket number and nothing happens. Don't know how to proceed to next step from there. Total worthless and careless staff."

"Purolator does not deliver to my house. Every other courier does, but Purolator always says ""the driveway is too narrow"", or ""the van is too tall for the trees around the driveway"", or ""the weather was too bad"". Like I said, every other courier company delivers to our house. If the driveway doesn't suit Purolator's van, can the driver not walk from the road to my door with my parcel? Their slogan should be ""It's not a package, it's an excuse to not do our job""."
"I’ll give anything less than 1 star. The driver lied that he attempted delivery at the same time when I sat at my window. He lied he left a delivery note and there was nothing.

Purolator is the worst delivery company in Canada."
"I recently had to change a delivery address which I had done before with other companies, which would take them couple of hours. Purolator says it will take “a few days” to update my information….

"I never received anything on time that was sent by Purolator. And the worst part that they never even call buzzer, just leave a notice and you have to pickup yourself... While any other service provider was able to reach out and deliver orders. That gives a shade on stores who use Purolator for any reason."
Purolator is completely incompetent. Took a day off to receive my delivery but the courier company had no clue when the delivery would happen. I finally had to explain to the driver that he'll appear more competent if I just did his job for him. Just arrange a place for me to pick up my delivery. I'll be happy to actually get the package and Purolator will look like they can deliver a package. Going on day 7 waiting for a delivery 3 provinces away. USELESS

"Purolator charges higher rates compared to Canada Post and touts quicker service, however this could not be more wrong. We have many customers waiting for their parcels and I am positive we could have gone with the less expensive Canada Post and it would have arrived much sooner. Toronto to Hamilton Purolator Express shipped Friday and its now Wednesday and the parcel is still stuck in Toronto sorting center. Customers choose courier as a quicker yet more expensive option and when it turns out to be the much slower option at a higher price, we get the complaints from customers and have to refund their shipping or the difference. The causes headaches for our staff and leaves a sour taste in our customers mouth. As I see there are hundreds of terrible reviews dating back some time and it seems to be the same complaints without remedy. Its crystal clear that Purolator does not care for the recipients or the businesses that use them, or else there would be positive changes. Will be changing shipping providers going forward."

"So Delivery of a package was attempted but they said I did not respond to a call, yet there were no calls to my cell on that day at all. I have had 5 occasions now where I have to try and get packages redelivered. Secondly when I asked for a time slot I was told that they can only say it will be delivered between 8am and 9pm, most delivery services at a bare minimum will give you an 8 hour time frame, or at least try and make it happen at a time where its convenient for you. This is such an inflexible service which seems to have no guarantees and no will to work with the customer. If I can avaid having to use them via purchases I will. They are doing no favours to Canada Post who are fighting to stay with the federal goverment. I may sound angry but I'm not I just can't understand why there hasn't been huge efforts to improve the profile and service of the company, it makes no sense to me. Please do not ask me for my tracking # as usual I will probably go along to the Purolator depot to pick it up myself."
"My April 18th order has not been received and there is no estimated date of arrival on my tracking #. More than 3 weeks later, nobody at Clarks can tell me when or if I will ever receive the shoes I paid for on April 18, just that they are experiencing problems with Purolator.

In future, when purchasing online, I will first find out if the company uses uses Purolator to ship their items, if so, I won't make the purchase. And I certainly won't buy from Clarks online again."

"I’ve subscribed to a meal plan and for the third time in a row the package is delivered days late. By the time it arrives the food isn’t even cold.
It was shipped out on Tuesday and had multiple transit delays. It’s 6pm, Thursday evening, so I’m guessing it’s going to stay on the truck and rot. I’m paying for next day delivery not 3 days delivery. This is bloody ridiculous. I never have major issues with any other delivery service. I’ve even called Amazon and asked them not use them except as a last resort because of the terrible service."

Incompetence throughout the people in the Edmonton area. I have a feeling that these so-called customer service Individuals are paid minimum wage. If the company was to pay a decent wage and hire competent individuals that might fix the problem. Who knows what the higher up managers and CEO's might do. Frankly the staff I've had the misfortune of dealing with over the past week are totally useless. If you want to call me I would be more than willing to talk to you. Jens 587-575-6907.

"Was awaiting an extremely important package for a small business. Driver claimed he couldn't find address despite a large address rock literally on the side of the small and open road. Then took two days to get package dropped off at warehouse for pickup. Ended up having to drive 50 km to a ""local"" store to buy item at 50% higher cost. Seriously question the safety of having someone driving that is paying so little attention they could not see the address of house that is perhaps 15 ft from the edge of the road.

This new phone system is just awful. If it ain't broke..don't fix it!! Such a terrible waste of time to be on hold and have to wait for a live person....why though!? The old system was so user friendly. We are definitely going to have to look for a new provider. I can't be on hold for 30+ minutes each time I need to ship something. The worst part is they know it is terrible and they have committed to not changing it until the fall. What?!
Y’all lucky if they left a notice on ya doors because it has never happened to me. Phone calls to their customer service is a west of time. I’m starting a Facebook Group to campaign that all the companies that we buy from stop using them or even other shipping companies that do business with Purolator sever ties with them because of very bad customer service practices. Oh by the way my rating is zero stars jus had to put 1 so I could vent.

"There was no delivery attempt just a sorry we missed you ticket on my front door. I was literally inside and it wouldn’t kill them to just knock. This is the second day I have waited and wasted my time and now I need to go to their facility. To pick up my package.
Best Buy needs to reconsider their partnership with puro deliver later"
"ZERO accountability
Ideally, this ""SO"" called company doesn't belong to be addressed as a shipping company. Tracking system is utmost useless.
Sitting at warehouse they update the system with false reasons and not deliver to customers. The management is as good dump yard. When asked, they themselves cannot trace package...How RIDICULOUS it can be"
"Whenever I have the misfortune of ordering an item & they ship it using Purolator, It sits at the first collection depot for days on end & then finally it starts to move & surprise surprise, the status ALWAYS go to ""weather Delay"" immediately after.
Without fail, every single time, regardless of the ""Actual"" weather. Sick & tired of Purolator now. Utter waste of space

UPDATE....
Ordered another item that was shipped with Purolator, It was shipped with next day delivery, and sure enough it arrived in my local area the next day. I thought ""oh, cool. maybe it will arrive""
NOPE....True to form.....It Missed the original delivery date, It missed the second delivery date, I called Purolator & was told that it would be with me by 9pm that day.....It Never arrived. Called the next day & told it would be with me within 3 days......It Never arrived. Called after 4 days & told that it would be with me within 7 days. All this time, the item has been sat in my local dispatch depot. I've even said that I will drive to the depot & collect it myself. But apparently they don't allow collection from that location.
Purolator are simply an utter Gong Show & the support team just lie to you to get you off the phone

"I ordered an item from bestbuy and they shipped it on schedule. Now granted we have had a snow storm come through but it made it to regina. Now I get an email that my parcel is too heavy for delivery. Ok understandable. Big heavy box probably in the 100 lb range. So I go to the depot as I need package by the middle of Saturday. They tell me that it is not in the depot and the guy that handles the large packages won't be back till Monday, Tomorrow being a holiday.
Go home and wait for a call is what they tell me. Now my question is why did it go out on a truck anyways as they said it was not back yet. And why did they not call up and I would have brought it in myself. They are unable to figure out something that simple. I am going back Saturday even if there is no call. I was forced to use pirolator in the past and always had problems. I did not have a choice on this shipment or I would have chose a different courier. By far the worst courier I have had the misfortune of using and having to rely on."

"Literally get worried as soon as I see that Purolator is the delivery company.
Ordered from Adidas, they said that it would be delivered on Mon Apr 11. According to Purolator tracking it arrived overnight Sun to distribution centre in Hamilton (where I live) but as of Mon morning it was labeled as ""delayed due to disruption"". It sat like that for 2 days. Contacted Purolator and after a 42 min wait, Customer ""Service"" rep said she could not tell me what that meant, flood? fire at the warehouse? truck broken down? She said she could give me no more info. And when I asked if it would be a day, a week, a month she said she had no idea how long it would be. And when it was finally delivered, it was delivered 2 doors down, left on an uncovered porch during a rainstorm. It was in a cardboard box and sat in the rain for hours until my neighbour brought it over. They are the worst."

"I ordered some PC speakers from Amazon and was expecting them on Tuesday, April 12th. The date got moved to Wednesday and so I awaited the delivery, made sure I was home, and eagerly awaited the phone call or buzz at my door. To my disgrace, I was alerted that the courier could not gain access to my building, no phone call, no attempt at buzzing me just ignored. If you see it's being delivered by Purolator just assume that it's not gonna make it...

Update: After many hours on the phone with customer service, updated delivery instructions, and long hold times. Today April 14th the driver came at 8:30 am and made no attempt to contact me or buzz my apartment. I recieved the all too familiar ""Your package could no be delivered"" for a second time. This company needs to be disolved."
"I've sat waiting all day for the delivery while looking out my window, when the truck pulled up I opened the door and spoke with the driver. He looked for 10 minutes in his truck and it wasn't there. So the team that loads packages said it was there but it was not. That team wasted my day, the driver's time plus fuel, and then the update email says he tried to deliver but no one was home. I get to waste my day again tomorrow when it will supposedly be delivered. 0 stars."

"I ordered an item thru marks work warehouse to whistler b.c. The Purolator delivery guy pulled up my driveway and then began to back down. From 50 feet away I tryd yelling thru a megaphone on my balcony to get his attention. As the driver was backing out of the driveway he looked right at me and drove down the street like he did not care. In my opinion do not waste your time shipping thru Purolator. The company doesn't allow their drivers to have a cellphone to contact clients/customers. They also do not allow them to accept any tips. Which means that there is zero incentive for any Purolator delivery personnel to get the customers delivery made. When speaking to their customer service about the issue they had a similar approach. Pass the buck attitude, they wanted to put me thru to a manager on the other side of the country. Please do not waste your money or time with Purolator, use a privately owned shipping service or Canada Post. This company and everyone in it will not take the initiative to satisfy their customers. AKA they do not care"

"Just had a delivery driver knock like a child leave a pickup notice and when I call to ask if he could turn around cuz I watched him drive away I was left in the on hold dead zone for an hour as he got further and further away if I wanted to go on a trip to pick up the item I would have just gone to the store myself like a cave man
Thank you for nothing purolater"
Literally delivered to the wrong address for THE 5TH TIME I called them and they said they'll fix it but still haven't got my package idk how hard it is to put an address into Google maps

"Waited all day for a delivery, then got a notification that it was taken to a pickup point after an attempted delivery. No one came to the door, no one left a notice as to where I'd even have to go. So now I've wasted a day and now another 45 mins of travel time to go and pick up the item. I have a small business and I've never not had a problem with Purolator. AVOID them all at cost"

Absolutely the WORST. I always have problems when they are the ones delivering my Amazon order. You contact them and they just brush you off claiming they don't take pictures proving they delivered at your address. Why is Amazon still doing business with them ?
"They drove by my house and didn't deliver the package. ""APR 6
8:00 AM
Weather delay - service will resume weather permitting Purolator network"". It's been bright and sunny for two days in a row. This happens all the time! The absolute worst."

"Wow, I thought it was just my experience. I agree with all the comments here.

Everyone I order I hope it’s not Purolator. There will always be something wrong if it’s them."

This is the worst company ever. They send me notifications saying they delivered my packages i went down immediately and there was nothing.they deliver everytime in the wrong place and when you call them they are never able to help you. I thought i was the only one but i am relieved to see everyone got the same problem. PURRALATOR you need to fix that or shut down the company already.

"This company is a shambles. Whenever I order something online and I see purolator are delivering, I know somethings going to go wrong. I've lost count of the amount of late shipments, damaged packages and lost packages I've had with this lot. Don't know why businesses use them."
If you order through Amazon and it is being delivered by Purolator cancel it right away otherwise you will be chasing around to find your delivery. Amazon has delivered 25 packages to my address over the last 5 months same address Purolator says they can’t find the address for their one delivery try to phone customer service or use chat forget it unless you have a full day. I am canceling my Amazon account so I never have to deal with Purolator again.

This is literally the only company that leaves my packages in the wrong place and theyre stolen every single time. Not only do I note SPECIFIC delivery instructions on my account I also leave a giant note in the lobby in big red letters right beside the sign my building leaves on the front door saying do not leave mine or any other packages in the lobby. Time after time after time they do the exactly the opposite. Time to start hiring people who can read. Do not I repeat do no waste ur time with this courrier. There are to many others to choose from.
"Hi Alysha, thank you for taking the time to write this review. When the item is contracted to be left without a signature those are the instructions the driver is required to follow. We recommend having the shipper require a signature. All items would then return to the depot if unable to be handed to the receiver at the time of delivery.

"Can't believe how bad their service is from the shipping, the tracking and the customer service. I wasn't home when my delivery was attempted because I didn't recieve a tracking number until i had the slip, the slip was left saying to pick up my package the next day (March 30th) at a local home hardware. I'm currently self isolating with covid and sent my friend to pick up my parcel at said home hardware today (April 1st) and there was no parcel. I called purolator in which they said my parcel would arrive at the home hardware later today. To my surprise it was sent back to my home address, no one is home again (duh) instead of taking it to the damn homehardware that it was supposed to be delivered to 3 days ago!! An hour after getting the update (once I seen the update) I called purolator again to tell them to turn around and to drop the package off at my house or homehardware, just leave it and stop carrying it around. I was told there was nothing they could do (even though it was only 3pm) and that if have to wait until Monday the 4th, 6 days after it had initially arrived! Just can't believe I have to go through this to get my parcel. Utterly ridiculous and embarrassing for purolator, look at all the bad reviews. Next time I make an online order and the shipping says purolator it's getting canceled right away. This is not fair and borderline illegal."

"This is kind of something you have package coming from no where, like Mars. I've been trying to talk to them in-person and over phone twice, only they says they can't do anything and keep telling me the same story that I know from the notification I've got. I don't really understand that they can't control their truck drivers. I've been waiting at home yesterday and sent me a notification that wasn't able to deliver my package. Today the same thing, I've been sitting at my window and talking one of the customer service Purolator, after 30mins hanged the phone I got notification again says attempt delivery date not available. I've requested pickup location and it will not available till the driver comes back. It is sucks honestly. My package has been shipped in edmonton three days ago and I haven't received it yet. I'm loose my day work and I am gonna loose money again for my technician. I will never do anything with this company next time. Not even recommend to others."

"Well, still waiting for my package to be delivered, was supposed to be delivered last Tuesday. I called Purolater twice and got the whole there is nothing we can do you just have to expect delays! Interestingly, the package has been in Alberta since last Tuesday - Calgary sorting facility (March 22 nd arrival), then off to Edmonton sorting facility (March 24th) and now they tell me it has to go through the Red Deer sorting facility. Not sure if Puralator is just being kind and trying to employ lots of people at various sorting facilities or they enjoy driving packages back and forth on the highway (without actually delivering them to customers) when gas prices are ridiculously high, but this is an excellent example of how to be inefficient! They have lost me as a customer and I just hope I will get my package delivered sometime this year lol!"

"I would put 0 stars if I could. I dont even know where to start when it comes to my experience with Purolator. I went to pick up my package at the depot WITH MY TRACKING PAPER IN HAND and they said someone already picked it up to which I replied its impossible because I am the only one living where I live. The employee or the manager didn't seem to care about anything. I asked if there's other packages at my adress since it's a building but I have a specific apartment number. They didn't even verify and said to go make a police report. While I was waiting in line I WITNESSED THEM GIVE ANOTHER PACKAGE TO THE WRONG RECEIVER BUT THANKFULLY THE RIGHTFUL OWNER WAS ACTUALLY BEHIND HIM IN LINE AND RECOGNIZED THE PACKAGE. I contacted Purolator and they didn't even care to look further and gave me the same answer the depot did. My package is worth a lot of money and not 1 person wants to admit that Purolator might have actually messed up on this one and gave my package to someone with a different apartment or didn't verify the names or ID properly. I will escalate this as high as I can because I refuse to let them make me think I'm crazy and that ""someone I know"" must have picked up my package. Absolutely the worse service and depot to go to. I am disgusting by the lack of customer service in person and phone."
"Worst delivery service ever! The driver came upto my doorstep and did not deliver and later I see the update ""Incomplete address - No entry code"". Come on, please treat your drivers as responsible individuals and provide them with a phone! or encourage them to use theirs. How difficult is it for a the delivery man to call up and get the buzzer code. I waited a day patiently for the scheduled delivery, see the delivery van but no delivery for some lame excuse. No attempt to satisfy the customer. I generally do not write such harsh reviews. I agree and empathize with others here, I had similar experiences as them. I hope you improve or request to all senders to wait for things to improve before using Purolator again. Customer service too, do not have any inkling of the issue or a desire for customer satisfaction by resolving the issue. The virtual assistant too is worst, asks hundreds of questions before getting to the core issue."

"I am extremely unhappy with the service of your company!!! I need a shipment today - unfortunately Amazon used your company as a service provider and I am unable to get my item delivered...

Are you able to use a telecom device? Maybe call me to say that you cannot find a GPS coordinate even though it is staring you straight in the face???

Attempted delivery once - cannot locate the address... I changed it - Someone not doing their job! I told them that this is important! Then..... tried the same address this morning, I was home! Driver just drove past...

After holding on the phone for almost an hour, I hear that they will not be attempting to deliver today, because the address new address was not updated...

"This impression is about the Purolator tracking ""service"". In a word: it's really bad. In fact, it's useless, unreliable, and I don't mean occasionally. The app consistently gives unreasonably tardy status updates and wrong ETA's. If I relied on them, I'd be out of a job for all the days off to be home for delivery. 9/10 faulty information. I mean, why bother with it, why provide the ""service"" if it causes more frustration than it means to allay? Simply awful."
"Ordered an overnight shipment of important documents from my bank. Supposed to not take any longer than 48 hours. I wait 8 days before I call my bank to ask if it was shipped.
They say yes, it was shipped same day. So we look it up together on the purolator website and they’re claiming they attempted delivery within the first 24 hours. NO THEY DID NOT. I was waiting. And no slip was left on my door.
They instead, waited a few days and then dropped it off at a Michaels 20km away from me, when I am SURE there are drop offs WAY closer.
They didn’t even attempt a second delivery, just said “whatever”.
Never attempted the first delivery.
If I hadn’t called my bank, I’d have never known they had “tried”. Hah. If you can call it that.

They are AWFUL"

My package was not delivered because the driver said they could not find address or was not displayed properly. I live in a house with addresses displayed clearly on house and at driveway. The funny thing is I have a camera, and it clearly shows the driver stopping infront of my house, takes package out of truck from back and gets back into the truck sits there for a good 5 mins and drives off....ummm hello? And yes I was home. I have a broken leg so was trying to scramble to the door. I called customer service and he was a joke too. I will never ever use this service again. Its honestly laughable.

"Also wish I could give negative stars to this joke of delivery service. The customer service I received was beyond useless. And apparently, I was supposed to just know that my package would automatically be delayed because it was too heavy? Don't see how that's a reason to delay my package when I have gotten heavier packages from other couriers on the proper delivery date. Get it together guys. And it appears I am not the only one who's gotten absolute garbage service from this poor excuse of delivery service.I could potentially lose out on the sale price of the item i purchased and it will be no fault of my own but all Purolators fault because ill have to refund and repay at full price. Like, deliver my stuff on time for the love of god."
"If I could give negative stars I would. Absolutely brain-dead delivery process. I live in an apartment and they don't know how to buzz when they arrive. I ask the customer service rep to get the courier to at least give me a call and apparently that is against company policy. Dang it's 2022 and this company is way stuck in the past. They don't even email notify you when they are out for delivery so I have no idea how they expect us to meet the courier.

Then they end off sending it to some far off location for you to pick up saying the receiver was unavailable, when I was home the entire time. I wasn't able to pick it up all week as I've been extremely busy, but I left notes with the customer service rep to redeliver the package, but instead it gets sent back to the sender.

This is not just a one off experience, but literally EVERYTIME I have a package delivered with Purolator this same thing happens. And the customer service reps have no idea how to fix it, I have left notes every time to guide them step by step how to contact me when the courier arrives, but still nothing changes at the delivery level. Just such a terrible company, if only I could get negative stars"

PLEASE DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY. don't waste your time. I'm sure someone will reply to this by asking me to send my tracking ID which I will do but I know it is useless.

First of all they lost one of my package and I only knew when I asked for a refund because I haven’t received it. I also bought some stockage and received a black skirt?!? On Amazon website it said that I received it but I never got it but got this skirt instead. My dad also bought something and his package was damage very badly, fortunately what was inside was ok but the box was totally destroyed. This is embarrassing…"

The delivery guy was parked right outside my apt, never got out of his vehicle, and the next thing you know, there is a notification saying it can't be delivered.

We don’t sit and wait for a delivery was sitting at the table and saw the notice on the door called and had to setup another delivery day.
Will be telling Amazon to please not ship by Purolator in the future.
To you Purolator why would you not ring the Door Bell first and then a knock on the door, our Door Bell is quite loud and we can hear it anywhere in the house but not his low knock. Thank You."

"I have sworn off Purolator and asked Amazon not to use them because they refused to not walk down a small hill that my 80 year old neighbour walked the day before. Instead Purolator would bring my packages to Banff where I would have to drive 28 km, pay for a national park pass and parking in Banff to pick up. My husband had not requested the same delivery service from Amazon and had his package delivered yesterday by Purolator where it was thrown about 20 feet and the box was crushed. My husband has since called Amazon and asked them to also switch his delivery to Intelcom. After hearing what happened, Amazon insisted on giving us the item free. Intelcom thankfully not only delivers to the door, they leave a text saying when to expect it the day before, and supply a picture of the package on your porch and the address on the house on delivery. Intelcom certainly has the problems with couriers ironed out. Purolator has not."

"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! They will charge you express shipping prices and then report ""delayed due to weather."" This keeps them from having to refund you for the delay. I was told this response and after checking the weather in the Calgary found that it has been sunny and nice the past few days (actually the past week)

Then get told they have nine trucks waiting for processing. I again asked for a refund and the lady yelled at me telling me I was not talking about the right weather.

Save yourself money and aggravation and use a respectable company that fulfills their promises without trying to scam you for extra money."

"God what is wrong with your drivers . Do they not want to work . Why even call your self a delivery company. 2 days now i have been home waiting for a call or buzzer. TWO DAYS.

No one has called or buzzed my apartment. They just simply give the feed back as “incorrect address “ dispite me calling in and confirming my address with customer support.

Why even run a delivery service like this . How can this government allow for such an incompetent service to run .

Most of all why is amazon partnered with this lazy and unworthy setup as their delivery partner"

"Purolator has twice claimed there was noone home when we were there waiting for delivery. This most recent delivery (third Purolator delivery), they left the information to pick up the package and when I went to the pick-up location, the package was not there, they did not know where it was. I asked to have it left at my door, but they just left me another message. I hope the package is at the pick-up location this time. Such a waste of time and gas. I will avoid all companies that use Purolator for shipping, even if it takes more time to ship and costs more money. They are unhelpful, unfriendly and don't admit there is any issue."

"Purolator Ground Service sucks. From Toronto to Calgary took them 7 business days, with the only tracking available, when it was picked up. DEFINITELY NOT 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 days. I called and there were no delays, and the operator couldnt track the package on the 5th day. This was very frustrating. When they passed the 'estimate delivery date' it dissappeared from tracking info as well. To say that I could kick a chair, is an understatement."

In my opinion purolator could be the worst courier service in the world. The stress I’m going through to get my package is enough for me to rank them the worst ever in the world. I only hope I get my package if I go to their depot
I had a package coming from Richmond BC. I realized the roads are bad so I gave it some extra time to get here but then it said it was in Edmonton for a week And nobody had informed me. I looked on their website talked to 3 different customer service reps on 3 different days and they all said they had got it back on track for delivery. I have had other deliveries from purolater and they have been fine. I go and pick them up at the local pick up point. The website kept saying refused delivery and I told them I have not seen it. They finally returned it to the sender And I had to get them to reship the same item. Hopefully I get this one and hopefully it's not with Purolator maybe fedex

I received a notice on my door from Pulolator saying my package (A Dell desktop computer) was available for pick up. I was told I would need Valid government issued ID. Or I would not be able to pick it up. I went to pick it up and was told by the lady working there that she had already given my package to someone who DID NOT have valid government issued ID. Her claim was that someone had come there with my reference number and showed her a picture on his phone of a license that had my name and address and his picture (likely a photo- shopped license that anyone can make) .. this is NOT Valid ID so why would she give it to this person?. I was told I could only get this item if I had ID which I do. But her claim is she gave it to someone who didn't have the paper notice that was left on my door. And didn't have ID. Now Purolator refuses to help me or take responsibility. Meanwhile I'm out $1300.. what a joke!

"My son and wife moved from Toronto where they sold their house. A bank draft for nearly $50K was sent via Purolator. It was sent to our address so we waited for 2 full days for delivery only to be told that, after our daughter in law harassed management about their incompetence, they agreed to find the letter and it could be picked up on Saturday from their office out at the airport. One would think that if you could not deliver a package on the day you were supposed to you would make it a priority for the next day. Not so it seems, they were not able to make delivery the next day either and my son was told it would be delivered on Monday! customer service does not seem to be in their vocabulary. Hey, Purolator you owe me 2 days of my life and gas money!"

I know I have nothing.
Choose their express service and they still leave my package at the airport office, did not deliver to my address at all!! Then why I need the express service???

"I got a call on the 2nd of march apparently my package was missing the street number I provided it and was told my package would be arriving on the 3rd of march the very next day. Of course I get weather delay when the weather is sunny and not a single traffic issue in my area. I finally contact there help line and it seems they didn't even add my street number until the 5th! They lied to me over the phone and now they don't even have an estimate delivery date and they keep telling me due to high numbers of packages they don't know how long my package will take! Every other shipping service at least gives an estimate and typically they always arrive within 2 days of the estimate if not on time. Purolator can't seem to get packages out on time there whole business seems shady. I've read so many reviews of ""lost"" packages and if it's over 100$ you don't even get your money back for them losing your package. Awful company contact the seller you bought from ask for a refund or confirm purolator isn't the shipping company as you'll never see your package and might not even get proper compensation for them losing your package! So frustrating"
"Purolator does NOT guarantee any of their delivery times or services.

If using Purolator only pay the minimum rate. Paying more than lowest rate will NOT get your freight moved any quicker.

I paid for 3 day ground from Ontario and after 6 days still no sign of parcel. I paid 159 instead of 84 to get 3 day service.

When I called to complain I was told too bad so sad but we don't guarantee service or delivery times.

Be aware of the 3 day scam and Just pay minimum"

"False weather delays every single package.

This company is the worst ever and should be investigated for fraudulent business practices.

Every single package that they get is immediately given a weather delay. Winter is not a delay, rain is not a delay, sunshine is not a delay. Everyone else on the planet still works when there is weather. I could understand a blizzard or torrential rainfall, but this is pure lies and fraud. They make this up to promise amazon a guaranteed delivery date, knowing they won't make it then lie to extend delivery date for every shipment. Nothing is ever on time. This is the worst shipping company on the planet and they get to just keep on going, screwing over every customer with every delivery because they don't have to answer to us. They have no accountability when all they have to do is lie to amazon about guaranteed shipping dates to stay in business.

If you ever have a package late from these guys by even a minute, contact the seller and get your money back. Put the cost of insurance back on the courier to force them to audit their services.

Funny that they have no problem dumping money into advertising on TV, but not quality of service. If I was starving in poverty and I relied on Purolator Tackle Hunger to deliver me food... I wouldn't survive."
"I am in rural (20 k from town) Nova Scotia. Four times now I have had to change my schedule because I would get a Puralator text saying delivery would be that day then I would get another text saying my delivery was delayed and sent back across the Province to the warehouse. One package made that trip 3 times..Today, my notification despite it being Monday still has not been updated since last Thursday saying my package was delayed because of bad weather. The first customer service rep said she could not find it
The second found my package but did not have an eta. Maybe Puralator should consider a new slogan. We promise we will get it there. Eventually, maybe.
Please just deliver my package Puralator and I promise I will never ask you again."

"This morning 8 AM, we were home. All three of us. And, yet, according to Purolator, we were not. So, they left a ""we're sorry we missed you"" notice.

"Two days in a row I've received attempted delivery notifications with instructions to pick it up at the drop off spot after 11AM the next day. And for the third day in a row, it's STILL ON THE TRUCK OUT FOR DELIVERY! The chatbot on their website was useless so I called customer service. The agent had the nerve to say ""I've never heard of this before"". OK, the company you work for is notorious for delivery issues, but whatever makes you feel better. He sent a message to the driver, then I was told the driver ""should"" drop it off and I could pick it up at the drop off location tomorrow. I said that was not acceptable - that this is the driver's fault for being too lazy or stupid to drop it off for the third day in a row. He typed some more, and said it ""should"" be at the drop off location today but advised me to check the online tracking before I attempt to pick it up again. If I don't have my parcel by today, I will not be a happy person."

"First of all they never, I repeat they never ever trying to deliver anything to your address, what they really delivering is a ticket with a text: ""sorry we missed you"". But the truth is they are not even trying to reach you. So now the question is: why not just say to people that you are not a delivery service but just temporary storage so that a customer has to deliver everything by himself. Why not just say the truth? Its been a period of 9 years when I have never ever received my package from the ""purolator"" driver. And right now I am calling them to find out where is my package and their automatic service tells me that my package tracking ID it is not recognized by their auto-response system. Which is putting me in a position where I can't even get my item from them. Wow! This is just the worst ever service you can get in Canada! I would place ""0"" if it would be possible here.

"I live in Ontario and ordered a package fro the bay to be delivered by purolater. No updates on the tracking site I was given, but 9 days after ordering this and the site said it hadn’t been picked up by purolater, I contacted the vendor. I was informed that the package had been sent to Saskatchewan…. Yes. Really! I was then told that it had been re-routed to Ontario ( from Ontario) and that it would be delivered by then end of day. Didn’t believe that, nor did it happen. What did happen was that it was out for delivery but didn’t arrive due to “weather” although on this day there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.
Lots of screw-ups with this company and statements made that are simply not true… They used to be really good, but that was a long time ago"
"I rarely get products delivered by Purolator and thought they were more accountable and professional than some smaller companies. Had a product delivered to Ontario from British Columbia which occurred quickly. What wasn't quick was my ability to find my package that was delivered to an address 300ft down the road. Took me an hour to find it at the wrong address and my house is clearly marked with the street number. I'm sure the driver was using GPS which was interpreted wrong. House number where it was left on a porch that isn't used by the house owner, was completely wrong and the package was on top of a bunch of junk to the left of the door obscured by a hedge which is why it took me so long to find it after scouring the neighboring streets and houses. Found it after filing a not received complaint with Purolator. Was told an investigator would get back to me at which time I intended to file a complaint citing delivery driver ineptness. Never heard from Purolator so obviously they don't give a crap about their service or customers. Thanks Purolator."
You should be able to give zero stars for this joke of a “company”. How they are legally allowed to operate at all is beyond me. All agents either lied or were ignorant to policy and they expect the customer to incur interest charges while waiting for refund. Hands down WORST business I have ever dealt with. I would be embarrassed to work there!

"I left moved to a new job, and a colleague graciously packed my stuff into boxes and had them shipped. They lost one of my boxes, with irreplaceable materials. Took them a month to search for it, and didn't answer most of my communications when I emailed. When I tried to be compensated, I couldn't provide receipts for contents making it un-reimbursable (not everything one ships is new with a receipt still in hand), and all the hassle and work fell to me. So I paid them to ship, then wasted a lot of time and never got anything back or compensated in any way. Just a form email ""sorry."" Why do I need receipts to be reimbursed?

"nahh this is bs!! my package was “on vehicle for delivery” for 9 hours… 9 HOURS and now it’s on “weather delay”. it was -1C the WHOLE day with no rain and no snow, how is this even possible? i bet they’ll leave a “we missed you” note tomorrow when they deliver it and then make me go to their facility. GREAT JOB!"
"If only we could give them zero stars.
We’ve been told three times this week that our parcels would arrive, only to spend our days waiting in vain. So far they’ve used:
- Delayed in transit due to natural disaster (Friday)
- Weather delay - service will resume, weather permitting (Saturday with light rain)
- Delayed due to current pandemic disruption (Sunday)
Absolutely abysmal service. I cancelled an appointment so I could be here for one of the deliveries."
"Great service from Purolator…sent an express envelope on Tuesday from Halifax to be delivered to Dartmouth. As of Thursday it is still not delivered. More weather delays and pandemic delays and then brought back to the depot at 4:20 pm due to weather delay again today. 10 degrees and mild outside. Shipment was within 5 km of my house and they tell me I can arrange to pick up at depot. It was closer to pick it up from shipper than it is from Purolator’s depot. ☹️👏🏻well done!

Their reply,

Hello Craig, my apologies for the situation. Sometimes the weather delays are from previous days, the weather can create a backlog and not all the parcels can be delivered each day afterwards. So sorry about the delays. - Delphine

My reply,

There was no backlog when it was showing on the truck today and then returned back to the depot at 4:20pm. That tells me that they decided not to deliver and to negate their responsibility, they put weather delay and now you are here just reconfirming their lies. Well done again…assuming customer are just idi*ts.

No reply this time,

so I waiting to see what would happen to my package the next day.

Once again it is not out for delivery! Is there anyone there who competent? I will be sending this thread along to John Ferguson as I just received a note from him stating how valued customers are and service is everything…rrrright."

"Usually Purolator has been quick with my deliveries, I would say 2-3 days, which is why I'm questioning what has happened to the recent status of my package. I made an order from the same sender January 30th, expecting it to arrive that very week. Checking on the status, it was picked up January 31st and has been sitting idle in the Toronto sorting facility to expire and today is February 14th (and indefinitely). I contacted the sender February 10th about the delivery delay and they proceeded to contact Purloator. I was told by the sender an investigation has been issued and to wait 5-10 business days? Sorry, let me get this straight why does it take that long to find out where the package is unless its ""lost""? It got scanned then where did the package go after? I highly doubt an investigation is being conducted because I am not getting any updates. This unreasonable time frame is being added to the time I'm patiently waiting on already. Purolator is asking too much from their consumer. I've had to make an order with another company who sent the package through Canada Post, I made the order on February 10th and its already delivered today. Another order made yesterday and will be delivered by Envoi today. There's no excuse about weather or being overwhelmed since its not the holidays.

I did contact Purolator myself online, but again, its the same response concerning the investigation. Not the agent's fault since she isn't in sorting department, but whoever is, needs to be taken accountable for this. What would happen if I never checked the status of my delivery and or assumed this was a standard wait time? Purolator would never be responsible to contact me to admit to this mishap. I rather they be honest with their mishandling instead of me waiting for unreasonable length of time so that this can be fixed sooner. How much more time do I have to wait, another couple of weeks (imagine a month to deliver within a province, out of country is quicker than this service) and nothing comes out from the investigation? I hate the thought, waiting this long for them to just tell me its lost or magically disappeared into thin air because that is the easiest excuse and say sorry? Seriously, if this happened to yourself you would be angry and question why the package is still sitting in sorting?

I've already lost trust in Purolator. The bad thing now is if the package is conveniently ""lost""or ""something else"" and the sender sends a new shipment, it will be with Purolator unfortunately and the potential for this endless loop where I have to wait for many more months in the sorting facility is definite. Reading the reviews, someone's package recently went lost in the Toronto facility too. What is there a black hole?

What now? Is it thank you for wasting my time, my money, and causing inconvenience? There's no point for Purloator to apologize after seeing all the negative reviews, no one is addressing the internal issues with Purloator and allowing this to go on and on. What's the point on getting feedback from the consumer when nothing happens, they take your money and not deliver what a great business model. If Purolator truly and wants to genuinely help me, go out of your way, then have my package delivered by this week the latest or let me know its lost already so that I can get a new shipment from the sender. I want whatever is the quickest route to get my package to me without me having to keep contacting you."

Im happy to say all was good and delivered to my door promptly and the driver was polite and friendly here in Carrs Landing. I would have gave 5 stars but i had signed up for email notifications and never recieved even one.
Overall happy with delivery and no damage."
"Just like everyone else, I got an ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"" while sitting next to the door awaiting my package. They just passed by my house without stopping! They have one job, and they are not even trying to do it. I'd give them 0 stars if I could."

Driver starts backing up in a full school zone to make way for a bus to turn . He doesn’t notice theirs 4 vans full of kids behind him keeps backing into us so we honk for him to stop before he hits us as we cannot back up anymore then stocks his middle finger out the window very unprofessional I wouldn’t support this company ever again after this

"I would rate this delivery service 0 stars.

The delivery personnel pretends it has tried to deliver your item, but has not done so. No note left, no email received. Now I have to drive 30 minutes to Guelph to pick up my package.
In future I will not order online if Purolator is the shipper. Amazon should get another company. Even Canada Post is better than this. The bar is very low."
"Wow! By far the worst delivery service I've ever seen! I wonder why sellers continue to use them. Its so inconveniencing to have purolator deliver your item. They never make any attempt to deliver. My item (RDT000110312) was supposed to arrive on 4th February, I'm still waiting for it. They falsely updated that they have this in their vehicle for delivery today. But, when we called, we were told that it will be loaded for delivery. So unreliable! This has been my experience each time I have had to wait on them for delivery. In spite of the numerous bad reviews about the company, nothing is changing. Please just totally avoid purolator!
I've had Canada post deliver my package and, while it might not be flawless, the experience is just not anywhere near this."

Pathetic Service and the delivery person was not even attempting to delivery. Just leaving the notes on the door to come and pickup. though there is a note on the door to use the buzzer. Too bad. Management has to take some action on the delivery staff.

"As others have said, if I could give them 0 stars, I would. Absolutely horrendous experiences.

After not receiving an update on the status of my items for over a week (I also got hit by the ol’ “Natural Disaster” B.S excuse, when there have been none in Canada as of late), I attempted to use their self-service “Virtual Assistant” to see if I could figure out what was going on. What a joke! The chat webpage kept refreshing and kicking me out of the chat, meaning I had to go through the process of entering all my contact information 5+ times before actually being able to speak with anyone. I eventually gave up and called and sat on hold for 15 minutes so I could actually speak to a real human and not get booted out.

(By the way, the only natural disaster I see happening here is your employee’s consistent and complete incompetence.)

After many apologies and excuses on the phone call, the customer support person reassured me that my items were indeed in transit and that the best way to know when they would arrive is to turn on the email notifications and wait for the “out for delivery” notification.

Ha, ha, hahahahaha. Please keep that recommendation in mind as we move forward with this tale.

So I wait. And I wait. And I wait some more.

FINALLY yesterday I see it’s in my city and shortly after, I receive my “out for delivery” notification. YAY, this is what we’ve been wait for, right?!?!

Right…. Hah.

An hour later, I see the status has been mysteriously changed back to “delayed in transit”. Huh? How the heck is it delayed in transit?! It was on a truck out for delivery in the city I live in just before that?

So I hop back on the Merry-go-round with customer support yet again. All the person on the phone can offer is “yeah it looks like they’re really busy in your area.”. Soooo it was out for delivery and then the delivery person decided at noon “nahhh… Ima be too busy today. It’s lunchtime. The rest of these packages can wait until tomorrow… I’m “too busy””?????!?!

The customer support person asks me to wait one more day and that it will be delivered tomorrow instead. They tell me to watch for that sweet “out for delivery” notification email yet again. “This will let you know the driver is on the way…” they assure me again. And so I wait…

Today at 9:30am I hear that ever anticipated “ding” from my email and see my item is out for delivery again. YAY! This has got to be it, they can’t mess this up again…

20 minutes later, my package is now ON ITS WAY TO A SHIPPING CENTER. What the actual eff?!?!?!

I got outside. No delivery attempt notification, nothing.

I call support AGAIN (this is the third time this week in case you haven’t kept up).

“Oh yes, that’s very strange, I can see it went out and no delivery attempt was made but now it’s being redirected to the shipping center. I don’t know why. Someone must have made a mistake”.

I ask for an explanation why. They cannot offer me one.

I asked to speak with a manager and they transfer me. The manager starts the conversation by asking “what can I do to fix this for you?” and I respond by saying they can find a way to have the package delivered to my front door today. They told me they would make some calls and get this fixed.

I just received a text saying the item is at the shipping center and I have 5 days to pick it up. I don’t have a car, I don’t drive, and I work until 4:30pm every night. There is literally no way for me to go get it within their hours, so it’s likely going to go back to sender.

You guys are literally a shipping/delivery company. We pay shipping on items to have then delivered to our doors, not to have you give us hope it’s going to be delivered more than once only to have it rerouted to your shipping center with absolutely 0 explanation as to why. Like… I cannot count the ways you’ve messed this up. This is literally your business. Stop making excuses, own your issues, and do better. I’m with the other commenters - I will boycott companies using your services because that’s how badly you’ve screwed this up."

"Purolator did not fulfill its promise to deliver a package and obtain a signature. Here is the sequence of events.

1. Package was picked up by Purolator on Feb. 2 destined for Calgary, AB.
2. Package arrived at Calgary sort facility at 7:40am Mountain time on Feb. 3.
3. Package was on vehicle for delivery at 8:19am on Feb. 3.
4. Delivery was attempted at 4:12pm —according to tracking info, receiver was unavailable. (not true, receiver was there all day and available to sign for the package)
5. I, as the shipper, called customer service to arrange redelivery. Arrangements were made to have the driver deliver on Feb. 3. If unable to do so, delivery would be made on Feb. 4 in the afternoon.
6. Second attempt was made at around 6:15pm Mountain time, same incorrect reason for not delivering.
7. At 9:39pm Eastern, I received an email saying that the package was ready for pick up.

This is totally unacceptable. The customer service agent advised that the driver’s first attempt was to the wrong location. The driver obviously went to the wrong location on the second attempt as well because the tracking shows “receiver unavailable” again, even though the receiver was at home waiting for the package to be delivered. The driver was told to call when he arrived, and the receiver would come downstairs to sign for the package. Instead, a text was sent because the driver was too lazy to call. The package was designated “signature required”. The receiver only received a text telling him the package was available for pick up, no phone call.

Now the receiver is expected to drive all the way to the Purolator Shipping Centre at the north end of Calgary to pick up this package, that was supposed to be delivered to his front door.

I am extremely disappointed in Purolator's service. I understand that there are delays and staff shortages, but this is just plain incompetence. The only way Purolator can fix this is to deliver this package after 12 noon Mountain time, to the correct address on the waybill, and have the driver call the receiver when he gets there so the package can be signed for and handed to him in person. Maybe it would be a good idea to send a different driver so he or she actually goes to the correct address.

Please make sure you address this issue promptly. The documents in this package are very important and time sensitive, as well as being highly confidential in nature.

Thank you."

"Me and my wife stepped out just for a 15 minutes walk in the neighbourhood. After 10 minutes as we're walking, we see in our remote camera mobile app that a Purolator guy is approaching our house front door with a delivery, holding 2 packages. What do you think happened next? Well, don't think too hard - it's Purolator, so the guy leaves 1 package under the door and takes the second back with him leaving us their classic ""We're sorry we missed you"" notice.

Now we need to waste our time, wait till tomorrow and go pick up the 2nd package on our own.

What a dumb company!"
"Hello Yuri, my apologies for the confusion. Shippers choose whether or not parcels can be left at the door, so more than likely one parcel required a signature and the other did not.

"I ordered two products, both same item, both from same location. Purolator will be delivered on time and UPS doesn’t even have it in Saskatchewan yet. I will never use UPS again. Purolator is always fast and efficient. They’re tracking info is always up to date and reliable. Bravo!"
"Their interface on a 3rd party (switchhealth) website wouldn't accept my home address....after some research, seems Purolator is using the Canada Post database! CP owns Purolator....but CP doesn't deliver mail to my house (I have a post box), so my address is not in their database, and of course Purolator doesn't deliver to PO boxes. Who's on first? Unbelievable."

"Very bad, youll pay extra for fast shipping only for it to get delivered by PUROLATOR which means they'll find every reason possible to screw it up and deliver days later,if at all. My bed is literally right next to my front door, quite impossible to miss it since I can hear everyone coming in and out of my apartment building, yet they'll still leave that dreaded ""missed you!"" Card on you doorknob.
Very unprofessional and I cringe everytime they're the ones that deliver my stuff.
Others like intelcom and Amazon will deliver my stuff so quick and easily in comparison it's almost like they appear out of thin air, with purolator it'll DISAPPEAR out of thin air.
Update: corrected my address and they still failed to deliver yet again, this time going in a different city???"
"Terrible service!! I ordered something and shipped it to a shipping facility near me to avoid a missed package, and for what ever reason probably out of sheer laziness they brought it to a purolator facility far away from me. They couldn’t even drop it at a purolator location near me? I contacted purolator 3 different times to correct the address because I had a funny feeling about it and I found out today they ignored all my requests and shipped it right back to the receiver. Customer service wasn’t of any help either.
So just a heads up... Apparently a delivery address means nothing and don’t even bother putting in a request for redelivery because it leads to no avail. It’s best to just go pick it up wherever they decide to drop it off.
After this terrible experience, I will
definitely think twice if not refrain from ordering from stores that use this shipping service."
Ordered a game though GB games which sent it though Purolator sadly. The package was super delayed so I decided to call them they said I could pick it up and one of there offices went there they gave me the incorrect package needed to come back and they said they did not have my package never sending or ordering from this place again eb games needs to find better shipping company

"I always get missed delivery emails when I’ve been home all day and can absolutely guarantee that no delivery attempt was even made. My Purolator packages always wind up many days late because they’re never delivered, and then the Purolator centre doesn’t have them for 48 hours despite the notices saying they’ll be available for pickup after 24 hours.

Daylight robbery. I paid 95$ for a pick up within 24 hours. $45 for pick up & & 45 for Express service & tax. I am waiting a whole day for them to come and pick up the courier.

Avoid Purolator Canada especially Montreal services. Each time they left Miss You card when I am very well at home. Ask me to come 20 KMs away from my home to collect. Very frustrating and annoying. Their customer care does not connects before 60 minutes. Full waste of time. So AVOID their services.

"It's impossible to get any customer support regarding a delivery that I tried rescheduling. Used Purolator's Virtual Assistant which is a total disaster. Very user unfriendly and almost impossible to get results for my request. After 1/2 an hour of trying to reschedule, the tool appeared to accept my request and indicated that the new delivery date is good. There was no email or text message forwarded to me indicating that anything went through and was accepted.
Used Live Chat to verify with a customer rep that the re-schedule worked and she verified that it did.....""The package is on the truck for delivery"", said Cynthia. Guess what? There was nothing brought to my door at the requested date. The tracking info shows that my package is still at the company's depot awaiting my pickup. Tried contacting an agent by phone.....this turned out to be another futile attempt. On hold for what seemed like an eternity before I disconnected.
The next time that I order something online, I'll check to make sure that Purolator is not the courier used.
Update - Jan. 27/22 - told by Purolator agent that redelivery requests can take from 24-48 hrs. and that I should register to receive email notifications re: the delivery.
It appears that this is going around in circles as it's been more than 48 hrs. since I requested the redelivery. Not getting any better."

"My package was due 5 days ago. Their tracking said delayed due to bad weather. But the weather was fine. 3 days ago they said the same thing, but weather is good. Yesterday they again said delayed due to bad weather. It was a nice sunny day. Then today, guess what, still delayed due to bad weather. It was so nice and sunny here we went for a family stroll. How do they get away with so many lies and incompetence?"

"How do I even get my one star back because they don’t deserve it. Purolator is as reliable as the feb 29th!. Don’t ever count on their services, ever! I made a shipping on Jan 10th, it is now Jan 24 and there has been no update. I have called every single day since last week and no one can tell me where my package is or when I will be getting my package. After lying severally about natural disasters delay, I confronted them that there is no natural disaster and they finally got back to me saying there is a backlog at their winnipeg facility! Absolutely ridiculous! Shipping was suppose to arrive 2-3 days from the day of order, now it’s a whole 14days and there is not one update on my file. This company runs on lies. I have had to cancel several customers orders cos of this! Do you know how much I have lost?!?! They won’t even pay me any settlement on this. If you run a business, never use purolator! UPS is probably your best bet. I have consistently gotten my package at no hassle from UPS. Purolator, hire more people to deal with your backlog! Or put a disclaimer to inform us and suppliers know that you guys are experiencing severe backlog so we don’t add to it.

Again I say: just Absolutely ridiculous!"

"Horrible company, I have a package that was supposed to be delivered by January 10th. It arrived in Winnipeg which is 350km from me on January 5th and hasn't moved since according to tracking. 17 days later I still don't have it even after having a trace put on it. Then they send me an email stating how there is delays happening etc, which doesn't tell me anything. What 350 km away and it can't make it to me in 17 days and counting? Purolator is the worst shipping company I have ever dealt with. I will now be posting a review with the better business bureau. They should be accountable for their screw ups. Now I have emailed them a few times and no response, no mention of what's going on with the trace at all. Where's my package Purolator? Or a refund? After reading all the other reviews I have come to realize how useless Purolator is and agree with other reviews that they should not be in business. I wish I could give less than 1 star because they are not even worth one. I do not recommend Purolator to anyone, go elsewhere."

"Absolute worst delivery service i've ever had in my life. Couldnt just drop the package, i had to travel across half the city to get a single simple package. When i got there they didnt even had it. Came back the next day, took my package home only to find out only 1 item out of 4 was in. The next day they came to give me another note instead of the actual package for me to go pick-up the rest.. i paid for home delivery jesus f* christ, not to travel across the city, paying bus fare and losing hours of my time. Otherwise i would of went to the f* store wich is closer to my home than the pick-up spot. Will never ever do business with any store who uses purolator. Get your f* crap together cant you see you only have 1 star everywhere? Do something about it ffs"

"I imagine the people working here have a difficult job, as they seem overwhelmed. So, perhaps the issue is poor training and company culture. But, interactions with all employees of this company showed shocking levels of disorganization, inefficiency, incompetence and rudeness. Had to make three trips to get my package as the staff could not locate it although the website said it was ready for pickup. Zero customer service whatsoever. The rep they have replying to all the bad reviews on this site clearly does not care to be helpful. Would strongly suggest everyone to choose any other delivery service provider if you can."

When I expressed my frustration about a package not being delivered and a delivery attempt not being made EVEN THOUGH I WAS HOME, the rude rep told me such behavior will not be tolerated!!!

"Our Amazon packages both arrived, the day after purchasing them online at Amazon.ca...including the package I just received today!

Purolator asked me to give them a second chance, but it's the same old song and dance, in fact, it's the second shipment in a row.
No Joke!

Our BUZZER # is included in the Address & Instructions.
No Attempts were made.
No Door Tag was left on our door, or anywhere.
We tracked our package and it claimed there was a delivery Attempt made.
Delivery Attempt made?
No, No Delivery Attempts were ever made.
Not that day or any other day, in the past week!
I've been home All day, Every Day, waiting!
If I had to go out, someone else was here!

I worked customer service and received calls from irate customers, trying to repair the damage to the company's good name, caused by these lazy employees, calling themselves couriers.

They're being paid to deliver packages, so, deliver the packages!
It's not that complicated!
Companies are paying courier companies for a service, a service in which you have a contract to fulfill.
Perhaps if customers, like myself, complain enough, to the Courier companies and the companies where we made our purchases from...
Actually, Reviews good or bad, don't seem to affect these Elite companies, so, perhaps we should just complain to the companies we're purchasing from? Then they'll have the option of choosing to save some money, by hiring independent contractors, hungry for business!
These Elite Courier Companies are sitting cozy and laughing at customers!

COURIERS:
3 complaints against any one courier, concerning failure to deliver packages, should be grounds for being Dismissal, or at the very least, a Demotion.
A good dose of reality should do the trick!
Back to a lower income, with part time hours, as Cargo Handler, doing a little hard work, might install incentive and a better appreciation of the cozy job they once had?"

"Ordered a power rack to set up a home gym and was guaranteed to arrive by the 12th. 2 days later, no update so contacted them and was told ""because the item is heavy, it will be delayed"". Why would you even put a guaranteed date of arrival just to use ""the item is heavy"" as an excuse?

Not only that, the last 2 updates are ""Arrived in Sort Facility"" and in the same area! Very frustrated as I needed this for a home gym due to lockdown and I'm due to receive it 2.5 weeks into purchasing 2 days before gyms open again.. Very frustrated with the service."

They stated ""Address correction needed"" but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the address. I called them today and they just asked me to confirm it over the phone. What?? Why?! If you need every person to confirm their address, make that clear. Don't just withhold my package because you want me to call you to confirm my shipping address.
I can't even pick up my package now because they won't tell me where it is. The online chat agent was not very helpful and they take such a long time to answer the phone. Been on the phone for 30 minutes now.

"My wife and I are seniors, and live on the ground floor of a small apartment building. My wife just called me at work - out of breath and very upset. The Purolator driver had arrived with four 10kg boxes, but refused to bring them to our front door. My wife pleaded with him, telling him she had health issues, but he just turned his back and walked away while she was in mid-sentence. What rude, callous behavior! EVERY other carrier brings deliveries to our door. What a horrible driver and useless company.

"Hello John, I'm so sorry to hear this. Right now the drivers aren't entering buildings for their own safety and the safety of the tenants, but the situation could have been explained better. I've filed a complaint to the depot to have them follow up with the driver, thank you for reaching out. - Delphine"
"Purolator’s service does NOT exist! I expected and paid for expedited delivery because it was Covid tests for travel so it was time sensitive. When tracking the pkg it said it was delivered (at 6:11pm) and 3 mins later (6:14pm) said it couldn’t be delivered as the address needed a unit number. My address is a house so no unit number is required and I double checked the address to ensure it was correct. I used the bot to redirect the pkg for pickup to their suggested place but when I got there found it was closed until Jan. 4th. Then Purolator was closed as it was Jan. 1st - closed?!
I spoke to a rep in Jan 2nd and she said it was a contractor who was supposed to deliver and they often scan the pkg as delivered before leaving their truck!?? She said she redirected the pkg to be delivered the next day. I tracked it again and found the same message - ‘needed a unit number’. I was so mad!!!!
Purolator customer service was closed on Jan. 3 (a New Years fell on a Sat. When they we’re also closed) I called customer service again on Jan. 4th (as they we finally open) and was told the previous agent had NOT redirected my pkg. I got them to hold the pkg and picked it up at their depot at the airport.
Their incompetence and disregard for their contract to deliver next day cost me almost $400 (unnecessary Covid home test + cost of lab testing) as well as time and hassle. I recommend using ANY other courier service!"

"Customer service is sub par, trying to reach a real person is an arduous process which seems to be designed to make you give up after waiting an hour at a stretch. As a business owner we often use courier services for deliveries, but purolator will never get our business again. Paid for overnight delivery from Vancouver to Vancouver island for a furnace motor on behalf of a client who had no other source of heat. 8 days later in the coldest snap we’ve had in years it finally shows up. This is after calling in multiple times, trying to find out why it was held for six days in a depot an hour away, despite the fact that all the other couriers still managed to make deliveries in spite of the weather.

I explained to the customer service rep how urgent this delivery was, the elderly couple who needed their furnace repaired had no other source of heat and we needed that delivery asap, they couldn’t even reach out to the driver who had it on board but was taking it to the wrong address to reroute it. Since then I’ve reached out again to see about a partial refund, and all I get is silence. Never will we use them again.

Just an update on the issue we had with Purolator, I reached out to the address given and was told again that it was due to natural disaster and they had a no refund policy. I emailed back and pointed out the fact that the motor sat in a depot an hour away from here for six plus days. There was no natural disaster between here and there, I could have gone and picked it up myself. The next email from Purolator was ""Landslides"". Ummm...no. No landslides. Snow. We had snow.....and yet all the other companies we deal with were STILL delivering. Once again I email back and tell them there were no landslides between here and the depot. Their next excuse was ""Well, there are issues with delivery in other parts of your province....so we couldn't help it.""

Ok, so first it's natural disasters (snow) then it's landslides (500 plus km away) and absolutely no way to reach anyone on a local level to arrange for pickup myself in order to get these people heat? I'm sorry but that's not ok. And since my last email I once again get nothing from them but silence. Buyer beware, you pay for overnight shipping and this is what you get if you use purolator. No apologies, no refund, just excuses. I'll never again use purolator for anything after this."

"This company has wasted so much of my time and money and I'm still waiting for my package. Who is the third party company that has my package??? No one at the office knows where my package is.. No one on the phone knows where it is? I'm paying way to much to have this package held hostage somewhere. It's a week late. I have items in the package I need to work. So, I'm loosing even more then the overpriced shipping.

Would not recommend using purolator!

Edit - P*** off with your generic/automated reply! I've already contacted someone about the issues. Guess I'll hear back from someone next week..... I think you as company should retire judging by the 95% bad reviews."
"Worst delivery service ever, I'm still waiting for my medical supplies that was suppose to be delivered today.

"For one thing..you should not have to rate 1 star!
ZERO stars for Purolator.
The driver does not even knock on your door, just a notice taped on it. No attempts at all to deliver. They probably leave pkg in vehicle and fill out the notice and tape it..what a joke! I understand there is Covid and everything but that doesnt stop food deliveries, furniture deliveries, etc...
Avoid using these people at all costs. They are not worth the money or effort!!

"I also wish there was an option for 0 or negative stars.

I periodically get packages shipped to me by vendors. What I hate to see is the email that comes in with the tracking number, indicating it has been shipped via Purolator.

Puro(much, much)lator will then give incomplete, incorrect, or inaccurate information on the tracking page.

They may or may not leave it sitting in a warehouse for days, or possibly a week or more as my current shipment is doing.

When they do finally decide to deliver it, there are a number of possible outcomes.
1. Tracking page will show no information, but the parcel has been delivered, or
2. Tracking page shows delivered a day or so ago, but it has not actually arrived.
3. There will be a ""Missed delivery"" where the driver indicates there was a problem (no answer, not home, incorrect address) when it is simply not true.
4. On occasion the package will be delivered on time and undamaged. I suspect this is caused by a mistake being made.

Now they are saying there is a 5 day delay for all packages going to BC, even though the real driving delay is a few hours. They also used that excuse on a package that was already in BC, just 45 minutes from my home.
It seems they will use any excuse, real or imagined, to NOT deliver in a reasonable time.

If there is an option to NOT use them, then don't. If they are the only option, thank about going to pick it up instead.

Edit: As I read through the reviews I am struck with how often Poo-o-later leaves a notice, or even worse, does not leave the notice indicating no one was available or some such, even when people are at home and waiting. When I worked in Calgary, this was the normal practice when P was asked to deliver to one of the offices I worked in. When a person pushed the very well marked buzzer on our front door, ALL the phones in the office would ring. And yet, Purolator normally said that there was no response. This happened at least half the time. And it was always the same driver."

"Do not ship with Purolator. Most of my packages that were delivered or shipments that I sent out were damaged. Insurance claims is a disaster and they would only grant the claim if you bought the label with a signature which would incur additional cost. Also they would not hold the packages to the closest customer pickup past the reattempts for example an attempt after business hours or no buzzer code in a multi-dwelling homes . This is a disaster because they would return the shipment to the sender, which will incur additional costs and two, customer/receiver will not get the package. More profit for them in this case. They have the lowest reattempt count, Only one day. Other big courier companies offer 3 days to reattempt. If you want to get your package in one piece or arrive avoid Purolator. Shipments are slow as a snail during peak season. They're shipping rates are expensive too.

Purolator delivered my package to the wrong address, imagine your only job is to deliver a package to the correct address, yet you can’t do that.

"Still waiting for mattress in a box to be delivered by Purolater, it’s been 1 month since it was ordered from Amazon Prime. My husband is recovering from surgery and needs his mattress. We ordered the bed frame at the same time and have had it for weeks. The big trucks have been up and down my road daily. I keep getting updates, this mattress has been transferred so many times it is ridiculous. Last night said it would be delivered by 8pm. At 7:38 said your package may be lost. Tracking no. IsEHJ000084120. I think Purolator employees are keeping packages for themselves. This is the 3rd time that they have lost packages in the past. Amazon doesn’t know what’s going on.We are seniors, home everyday and have a note on the door to leave packages. If they can transfer a bed in a box to different trucks for weeks then they should be able to deliver. Roads are clear and other people are getting their stuff on my street so stop putting up lame brain excuses due to weather. I hope Amazon will seriously consider not using you guys. I will quit prime if this poor delivery system continues."
"This is a company of lunatics and a--holes. The worst delivery, totally unprofessional, unethical, dishonest, and irresponsible! Driver does not even ""attempt"" to deliver, but once left a ""we-missed-you"" pick-up note on our door while I was sitting by the window, and once even did not stop by but the online tracking showed the driver came ""twice"" at 2:15PM and 6:00PM that day and claimed ""receiver not available!"" What a bxxshit! That's an unabashed lie as during the holiday season in the pandemic we are home 24/7! They dared to claim ""receiver not available"" and then asked us to pick up 8km away! This has happened multiple times and we are done with Purolator. Whenever we order something online we would make sure that the vendor does not use Purolator!"

"Once again, Purolator failed to deliver the package. I verified twice that my address and building code were correct. The initial delivery was scheduled for December 24. I did not get a call to buzz in a delivery nor were any ""failed delivery"" instructions left by the delivery person. This is about the fourth time out of 5 that the same thing has happened. It seems that the delivery person doesn't even get out of the truck, just says recipient unavailable and drives on. To make things much worse, had I not tracked the deliver on line, I would never have known that the delivery was ""attempted and failed"". I went on line and asked for it to be delivered a second time. This delivery was schedule for December 29. Of course, that never happened . . . instead there is a notice (online only again) that I have to go to a Purolator office to pick up the package. Totally unacceptable . . . I paid for shipping so I shouldn't have to go anywhere to pick up."

"Seriously. I paid for next day delivery. They got the package December 16th with delivery scheduled for December 17th. I was in a bad car accident so I can’t move too fast so I spent all day in my kitchen waiting so I wouldn’t miss the driver. At 9;30 pm I went out to make sure the chickens and goats are away and put my garbage out for next day and found a note on my gate less than 35 yards from my front door stating they were unable to do delivery. Really? You could easily see my house and the lights were all on. That’s bs that I wasn’t available. I called and asked W T F happened and told them there was no way I could drive 40 min to pick up package from airport just because their driver didn’t want to do his/her dammed job. They said they were sorry but since it was Friday they won’t be able to do Redelivery until Monday. Fine. Total bs but I’ll patiently wait. I waited all Monday in my kitchen but no attempt was made. I also had been getting 3-6 emails every day since Friday evening saying my package would be waiting for 5 days. I called Saturday to see if they first agent screwed up but according to person on phone it’s an automated system and they will put a note. But the emails came every day. There was no change on package being at airport waiting for pickup even though I called every day that week to ask what’s going on. Exactly a week later on the next Friday I got a call from an k radio number (I’m in British Columbia) that I missed and called right back and texted back with no reply. I still don’t know who called but to be nice let’s say it was the driver…maybe. Purolator site updated to say attempt was made. It wasn’t. It had snowed and I went out to check but there was no footprints or tier marks in my driveway, near my gate or even on the street at my mailbox so no attempt was made to even come down my street! I called and asked wth is going on. Rush next day delivery a week later there was only one attempt made. The following week still no package. And yesterday 3 weeks later the site updated that my package was out for delivery. Want to take a guess what happened? Nothing. The website didn’t even update to say unable to deliver or anything. It’s now Tuesday and the site updated at local facility. Then our for delivery. How can a company who’s entire business model is prompt deliver and their motto even is “it’s not just a package it’s a promise” not deliver? At this point shouldn’t a supervisor be getting in a vehicle and hand delivering? ‘All I can say is none of my friends or family, my company or any company I’m partnered with will EVER use such a bad company again. I’ve had bad delivery company’s with Amazon such as intercom. Up until this point they were the worst I’ve ever dealt with (courier, postal, or package service) but by comparison when their drivers make no effort to deliver (I have camera footage of a driver not even getting out of their vehicle but instead throwing a package marked fragile AT my car and if I hadn’t done my daily walk around that day would have run over my fragile package) they at least reply to messages or pick up phone and get it resolved within 2 days. I’ve always gotten my package. But purolator has lost my $500 rush package and isn’t willing to admit it or worse possibly their drivers don’t want to do their job so just say unable to do deliver. Never will I use them again and will gladly pay more to use any other service out there. Criminals as took money for next day delivery and claim to attempt to redo liver once a week without even coming to the property. Bloody insane."

"Purolator is awful ,with very bad service ! Customer service in this company is a joke ! They do nothing for you but give u wrong info and no one is responsible! I bought a tv from best buy and they delivered it with purolator , during 10 days , i follow it up every day and contacted with purolator , customer service told me that it will be sent tomorrow during working hours from 8 am to 9 pm , i got off day from work stayed at home and wsit for my package but they didnt send when i called again to investigate what happened, they said oh it will be sent tomorrow and it repeated 3 times, i explained them that during working hours I'm not at home please send to me after 5, they said OK and again tomorrow they sent at noon !!!

"*Zero Stars*

Worst experience ever! My package left the facility in Mississauga and was set to arrive in Niagara on the lake on December 21st.

On December 23rd my package magically ended up in CALGARY and now won’t make it in time for Christmas.

My package is now set to arrive on December 31st!

Customer service was useless to make matters worse and didn’t help in the slightest. All I was told is sorry and it wasn’t my fault.

I will avoid this courier service like the plague moving forward."

"This is insane. My package originated in Richmond BC. Then for almost a month I heard nothing. Then I find out it went to Los Angeles, then it reappeared in Vancouver. It made it's way to Winnipeg and now all of a sudden there is a delay due to a ""natural disaster"". What the actual heck???? Never again will I buy from a company who uses Purolator. Not the first time they have screwed up a delivery, but this takes the cake. So much for our family Christmas gift this year. Thanks Purolator."

"1 star since no option for 0 stars. I ordered a gift from Amazon, they shipped from ON on Dec 16.

Dec 18, the package arrived in Vancouver, and ""On vehicle for delivery"" at 11 am. At 5 pm, it shows ""Delayed due to current pandemic disruption"", fine.

Dec 19, ""On vehicle for delivery"" at 9 am, end up with ""Attempted delivery - delivery date rescheduled"" at 10 pm, fine.

Dec 20, ""On the vehicle for delivery"" at 7 am, the driver never shows up until now, though, two Purolator trucks drove by my apartment today.

CAN YOU STOP FOOLING YOUR CUSTOMERS????

IF YOU HAVE NO PLAN TO ACTUALLY DELIVER THE PACKAGE, PLEASE LET US KNOW, I WILL BE HAPPY TO PICK UP THE PACKAGE BY ME INSTEAD OF WAITING THREE WHOLE DAYS AT HOME!!!!!"

"went to the Anjou,Quebec expedition center today. I was served by Shaina. She was extremelly helpfull as she suggested an alternative shipping option which made good sense. Great service thanks!"
I also have a package in limbo because of “natural disaster “. A term they commonly use to cover their incompetence. I will be advising all retailers; if they use Purolator or Canada Post; I will not purchase any products from them. It’s worth the extra money to deal with a reputable courier service who is reliable.

"I’ve arrived to Canada 6 years ago. Since then I’ve used all the carriers and I use Amazon Prime a lot. Never a problem with FedEx, Canada Post, UPS, Intelcom,… Never. However, every time that I see Purolater is the courier, I know things won’t arrive, or they will arrive damaged or too late. I’ve had to deal with purolator 10 times and always there are problems. The latest one is sweet: I ordered a sofa-bed in Wayfair that was send in 2 orders. The orders went out in 2 different days coming the first one in Purolator and the second one in FedEx (the next day) guess what? The FedEx order arrived 4 days ago (1 day before I expected), however Purolator says today« the delivery could take 4 days more because of the dimension of the package » (they are already 3 days late). It’s a sofa bed, I ordered it because I have visitors who will be now sleeping in inflatable mattress because the poor service from these people. I’ve already advised wayfair and any online retailer, I won’t order if they use Purolator. It was the last chance. Such a bad company…"

"Ordered items and paid for Express shipping service from a company in Ontario, told me they use Purolator for shipments to BC. The tracking information provided by Purolator indicated my package was en route but no expected delivery date was available. The tracking information was updated yesterday telling me the package was on the local delivery truck, then I received an email advising the package had been delivered, handed to me at the front door! I work from home, the delivery was supposedly made at 1235pm. I was sitting at my desk with a clear view of the street and our front entrance all afternoon and there was no delivery, no Purolator truck. This is the third time Purolator has screwed around with supposedly delivering packages.
Each time its the same thing... there is no interest in providing customer service, no attempt to resolve the issue. Are Purolator and its employees, delivery drivers really in business because it sure seems to be just a front without regard for customer service; perhaps the drivers just thieve and steal items they like knowing customer complaints will be ignored? Avoid this company and take your business elsewhere if the retailer won't use another shipping service!"

"I ordered a PC that was delivered by Purolator (I had NO choice in that). It was originality shipped from the factory on Dec 8 (""Shipping label created""). I didn't see ANY tracking information of it being shipped or anything else at all until Dec 14 when I finally received some tracking information that indicated it was at a Sort Depot on Dec 13. A 5 day gap in this day of electronic information.
After that, there were no further updates other than a meaningless note on Dec 14 that it was ""Delayed due do to a natural disaster"" in bold and red. Nothing about its status, where it was or when I would get it. After that there were NO FURTHER updates at all.
I phoned the support line on Dec 16 as I had NO idea whosoever of its status or where it was. I was told that it was supposed to be shipped EXPRESS on the 14th but was PUT IN A SEMI-TRAILER INSTEAD. I guess that was the ""natural disaster"". As well, they could NOT tell me where it was or when I would get it.

Unacceptable service"

"I ordered a shipment from Amazon, and for some reason they decided to deliver it from Purelator, despite their history of bad services. Well, of course, they disappointed. All they had to do is bring my parcel from Guelph, ON to Waterloo ON, a 30 MIN drive if there's traffic. It was supposed to be a same-day delivery.

2 days ago they put the package as ""Delivered"". It wasn't. I contacted their customer service and they told me the package says it's delivered. I told them it was not delivered. They said sometimes the delivery guy says ""delivered"" BEFORE they actually deliver it, and I should just wait. Well I waited and the package has not arrived, so after contacting them again they said I should get in contact with the seller.

For why? YOUR employee has MY package, he LIED about delivering it (essentially stealing it) and now you guys won't get in contact with him...?????"

"This is the most awful service. My parcel had been sent out from Quebec, then came to Toronto and by MISTAKE had been re-directed to Quebec again. 2 weeks passed, I'm still without my parcel. I called to the customer service and they're always lying to me, that parcel should arrive the next day or two. I asked to open a claim, but they refused to do it. Instead of that, a lady from the customer service advised me to contact with sender and withdraw the shipping costs from him. Why? Maybe Purolator needs to hire more intelligent people, who can read the address properly and maybe know the difference between Saskatchewan and Quebec?

"I had a parcel picked up at a Toronto location on Dec 1, 2021 which was picked up by Purolator the same day. It arrived in Kelowna on Dec 7 and placed on the truck for delivery the same date. It was scanned again at the sorting facility within 23 minutes of being scanned on the delivery truck. On Dec 8 it was scanned for delivery, later that afternoon it was scanned indicating ""Delayed in transit due to road/highway closure. Note it was already in Kelowna and there was no road closure which would have delayed delivery. On Dec 9 it is scanned at the sort facility and back on the truck for delivery. In less then a hour it shows, transferred to shipping center and within 45 minutes it's available for pick up at the counter. I was home all day there was no attempt to deliver the package to my residence, not was there a notice left that it could be picked up at a depot. I called customer service and did speak to a live body. I had asked the parcel to be put back on the truck and delivered on Dec 10. I was told it was too late and could not be re-scheduled on delivery on Dec 13th. The CR said she would make the appropriate entry in the system and I would have my package on Dec 13. I was told it was at the depot in West Kelowna. I had been charged for delivery and I expected Purolator to fulfill their obligation to deliver the package and not for me too do their job and drive to the depot to pick it up. On Dec 13 the package had not arrived and when I checked the tracking information there was no indication that the package had been re-scheduled for delivery, matter of fact it, still showed it could be picked up at the counter, again no address. I called the West Kelowna depot \enquiring about the package but was told they didnot have anything in my name. I called Purolator again and spoke with one of the representatives who was apologetic. This was the fifth day it had been at the depot and I was concerned it would be returned to the sender. I asked which depot the package was been held and I was assured it was in the Main depot in Kelowna. I made a special trip into Kelowna to pick up the package that should have been delivered by Purolator 4 days hence. When I arrived at the Kelowna depot, I was informed they did not have the package. The Purolator representative called the West Kelowna depot and confirmed the package was still there. Not only had I wasted my time by driving into Kelowna and back to West Kelowna ( 50 kms) to retrieve my package, something that Purolator had been compensated for to deliver. I am extremely disappointed in the service that Purolator is providing. I believe for whatever reason the delivery driver did not make any effort to deliver the package to my house and he would just drop it at the depot which was easier. I will have to give much thought the next time I need the services of courier. Tracking # VAV000789573. Work File # 16163873"

"Nightmare to deal with. Parcel is missing. Automated systems, phone and chat, are punitive to deal with, and ineffective. I tried to track it for hours! So I drove to the Depot centre as they have actual humans. They tried to help , but since it's been delivered to an agent, they cannot. It seems to be out of Purolater's hands once


Or some such thing. So... its helpless. They said just wait and it may show up sometime at the Depot. ""No guarantees"" their exact words. If it gets returned to the sender I will cancel the order for a refund, unless the company can ship it an alternative way.
I have had problems before. I honestly think I will no longer do any orders with any company that uses Purolator. Life is too short!

I spoke to the customer service regarding my item to be delivered. The agent was kind and caring. I would rate 10 stars if I could. Excellent!
UPDATE: they found the package and have delivered it. They have accepted my package at a Purolator drop off point and have now lost it before it has even been scanned into the system! They have lost the package before it was even shipped how is this possible?! I can't even make a claim cause it's disappeared. Called yesterday and was told if the was no scan then no package. NOW IM OUT $650?! IF you have a drop off centre that doesn't scan packages you might as well leave them at the side of the road. This is unacceptable and you guys need to get to the bottom of this and take responsibility for a service you charge for.

"I was supposed to reacieved a package from Amazon since the 3rd of December, it is now the 14th and still nothing, they came to deliver my package and did not bother to contact me when they arrived, left a “sorry we missed you” letter and drove away with my package mind you that was on the third, I have contacted puralator countless of times they keep telling me it will arrive on this date and it never does. THE CRAZY THING IS puralator proceeded to BLOCK my phone number so I would not contact them again because none of them can tell me where my package is or when it will be delivered. I am heated because I just moved to a new house and the package I'm supposed to receive is my bed so IVE BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR FOR THE PAST 3 WEEKS and Purolator HAD THE AUDACITY to block my phone number when all I wanna know is where tf is my damn package. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I've SPENT HOURS ON HOLD TO SPEAK TO THEIR DUMB ASSES JUST TO GET HUNG UP ON AND BLOCKED, what type of fuckery?"

"Dropped off 2 boxes content valued +/- $250. After one month receiver had not received the boxes. Gave Purolator all tracking numbers pictures of content proof of sending. Purolator confirmed the boxes had been sent but there had not been delivery and concluded to lost items. A link was provided to go to next step. When I entered all info got an instant message that package had been received. Tried phoning, emailing replying to customer service survey...no answer back! No refund! no service! All their messages mention how they care for the clients which is not at all what they are demonstrating.

Had to share how Purolator are incompetent and this will conclude my experience. After getting their invitation to correspond with them I was asked once again to send (which I did) proof of dropping off the boxes (Purolator shipment proof), proof of content in boxes; proof of purchase; proof of shipment numbers. Did receive answers from customer care. Corresponded with more than 5 people from customer care (who do a wonderful job but have no control over final decision). They sent me a pin# after declaring lost items (3 times) and inviting me to file a lost claim report which I did.
Their answer is:
As you may know, Purolator's practice is to scan all shipments tendered to it immediately upon receipt and at various stages of transportation, including upon delivery. After a thorough investigation, we were unable to find any scanning activity in our records pertaining to your shipment. Consequently, we are confident that your shipment was never tendered to Purolator for carriage and must, therefore, decline liability.

Please note that had your claim not been declined, Purolator's liability in this instance would have nonetheless been limited to $2 per pound or the declared value entered on the bill of lading (if higher).

Should you have any questions or other information relevant to our investigation, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.

Yours truly,
Purolator Inc.

A polite way to tell me I am lying!
I give up! I am so surprised that Purolator are still in business with all the other carriers doing such a wonderful job. NEVER will do business with any company that is dealing with PUROLATOR nor use them. Naturalizer and Purolator has lost my business. Hope they wake up and use another delivery company.
Wishing this experience serves all people who want to use Purolator think and rethink your decision there are lots of great courriers out there."

"Terrible experience and terrible company in my opinion. I was supposed to receive a package and for ""safety"" they leave a note of delivery with the wrong name on it and then brought it back to their center where it got stolen by someone who showed up before me with apparently an ID with my name and my address. They took 5 days to call me and to tell me what they had told me the first day : ""your package has been taken by someone with an ID, sorry we can't do more for you"".

Their ""security protocols"" are just downright bad and they really don't give a damn about it. The person on the phone that called me showe absolutly 0 empathy and wasn't even a bit helpful."

"Terrible service.this is the 2nd time in less than 2 weeks that Purolator is very late with their deliveries. The 1st time they gave my package to a 3rd party that delivered it to the wrong address. The person living at this address had to delivered it at my house. Why do we pay Purolator?
I waited 4 days to get my package. This was food and it was spoiled. I contacted the shipper and they sent a replacement. Well I'm still waiting. They told the shipper that my parcel was on the truck but they lied. It's been at their Boucherville Que. Since 1:30 am since Thursday morning. It is now Friday 11:00 and still no delivery.
I informed the shipper once again and told them to change carrier. They said they will use FDX in the new year for all their deliveries outside Toronto.
I'm very disappointed
Francine

"They now use Canada post for expedited packages which is according to Trustpilot one of the lowest rated postal services on this planet. I currently have 3 delayed Puropost packages that I assumed would've been handled by Purolator or at least treated with some expedience.
If I could give a negative rating to Purolator I definitely would."

"Absolute garbage of a courier service. Always the same robot response.

I've NEVER recieved a package on time. Always a garbage excuse, that is if you can even speak to a human, who if you do, will lie through their teeth."

"The only reason I gave 1 is because you can’t give a zero. Will never use this company again. When they damaged a package and lost several items In it they said it was not their fault and that it was senders responsibility to replace missing items as they were food
Items. That is ridiculous... Purolator lost the items...not the sender. What the heck ....did they eat them! Not impressed and will never use this company again."
"We paid extra parcle was left in lobby
we signed up for email notification but that didn’t work either, Even a note to the driver please ring the doorbell was on the package But the driver didn’t even try.
Back to Canada Post which sometimes ring the bell and cheaper but not much better at delivering parcels. As they don’t always ring the bell.
Online shopping we hate it now, due to the people that deliver the parcels. It has become a stressful experience.
Maybe we will just avoid delivery’s altogether. As sometimes they get ripped off. Thanks again for nothing Purolator 👎"

"It's a really crapy delivery company. It's one only one that do not deliver at my door, probably because they don't know how to use an elevator. My packages were already thrown in the snow outside the building and stolen several times because they were left in a public area. The last one, my computer was stolen from a Porulator pickup place. They are not trustworthy and I'm avoiding buy anything online delivered by them. Pickup place at Ontario E, Montreal."

"PUROLATOR is the WORST delivery company ever, they must be cheap I guess but it's easy to understand why.
My order is still not delivered because Purolator doesn't take the time to ring at the door, the guy just go out of the truck, stick a post-it and run away, impossible to catch them.
Don't take a day OFF at home to receive your package cause it would be useless and a waste of time, be ready to pick-up your order at a cheap delivery center 10 miles away from home.
Every other company would be a better choice."

I ordered an Xbox series X and coincidentally it is missing? I’ve spoken to the people that work there and they said that it’s missing. And they took days or weeks to respond when they asked for information. They’re definitely stealing customer goods and using the weather and the holidays as an excuse to steal. My Father ordered one about a month prior to me ordering mine and he received his a couple days earlier with everything intact. I would not trust this company at all and their company is filled to the brim with terrible people that steal and auction your goods online for double the price.

"I am so disappointed in Puracrapper. Every delivery has been delivered to the WRONG house!!!!
I talked to the driver and told him and he has never corrected the problem. How stupid can a company be??? I called a number of times and they do not care.
UPS called me and asked how to get to my place.
I told this driver personally where I was!
But Puracrapper just drops it at the wrong house and no one even lives there now. Look in the window DRIVER!!!!! Falher AB driver do you remember me talking to you?"

"2021/12/06

My parcel was suppose to be delivered the 1st of december, the last tracking info I got was ''Tendered to CPC'' the 2nd in my hometown, the tracking didin't move since, I contact them to know who have or where is my parcel but they tell me that they dont have further details because they hand out my parcel to a ''local courier''. So basically they don't have any idea where is my package and who is responsable for the delivery so I can't even pick it up myself... I will not buy anything from a seller that ship with them anymore."

"Horrible service!
They gave me a day for shipment, made me wait the whole day ( with my phone in my pocket) so I wouldn’t miss their call and end of the day when I called them, got connected after 30 min of waiting, they told me that that driver had called me and I didn’t pick up the phone!!!!
I patiently scheduled another day , thought to check again with the agent on the day of delivery to confirm and he told me there was some error of scanning on their end and I would receive it the next day. Then , he told me that an agent will call me as he had created a case for my shipment. THE AGENT WILL CALL DURING ANY PART OF THE DAY OR SEND ME AN EMAIL!! meaning now I have to wait for the agent … i live in an apartment and I need to book the elevator every time to receive a big piece.
Still waiting!!!!!"

"AVIOD AT ALL COST! I can't believe this is the service that I receive from Purolator…

I had a shipment delivering to my home on last Monday, Nov 22nd, I wasn't home so the driver left a notice card indicate it can be picked up the next day after 10 am at the west Edmonton depot. I went there the next day around 4:30 pm, my package was not there and the staff advised me to contact Purolator to have it redelivered. I contacted an online agent on Tuesday evening, the agent submitted a relidvery request for me, but has noted that up-to-date scan info has been missing for my package so have filed a tracing case for me. On Wed, the tracking info shows it was out for delivery in the morning, but shortly it states ""Weather delay"", although the weather was absoultly fine in Edmonton on that day. In reading the Purolator Google reviews, I found that the ""Weather delay"" excuse was commonly used by Purolator to manipulat with customers when the weather is just fine. On Thur there was no update. On Fri, the tracking info shows it was out for delivery again in the morning, but then been dropped off to a Medi Drug location in Northeast of the city?! I'm in the west end, It is literally 30 mins / 40 kms one-way drive from my house. I contacted tracing specialist again, and have been told that my redelivery request is still pending, they contacted the depot to have it recovered and redlivered but no follow-ups whatsoever. I'm finally tired of waiting and decided to drive to the Northest Medi Drug location to pick up my package on Sunday, but I drove all the way there only found out it is closed on Sunday, with the info clearly states it's open 12-5 pm on Sundays on the Purolator site!

Now it has been the second week. On Mon Nov 29th there was no updates. On Tue, tracking shows it was redirected and out for delivery in the morning, but in the evening it states “Address correction required - incomplete / incorrect address provided”

Seriously, I can’t image what other excuses can be made up to cause further delays… Help me understand that why Purolator left a notice card on my door with the correct address on Nov 22nd and claim the address to be incorrect now?!

On Wed again there was no updates. On Thur Dec 2nd, tracking shows it was out for delivery again in the morning, so I’ve been desperately waiting for it all day. Around 5:40 pm, I saw a Purolator truck parked at my neighbor’s house so I ran out as I have no more trust with this company and its drivers. Sure enough, by that time he already went to the wrong house to try to deliver my package with the notice card left on my neighbor’s door! I showed him my tracking # and info on my phone and he finally gave my package to me. Imaging that if I’m not home or not have noticing their truck at that time, only God knows how can I pick up the package from where with a notice card that I might never receive!

This whole experience has been a total joke… definitely filing complaints with all agencies/units possible to seek further assistance and boycott Purolator from now on."

"Terrible terrible service. I'm always home but they always leave me a card saying ""attempted for delivery, customer unavailable"". They never once called the bell to even try.

"In 1860, the pony express mail service was created to provide coast to coast delivery. Using fast horses, mail could be delivered across the nation in 10 days.

Its a shame that this technology was lost as I am now on week 3 of waiting for my package from Toronto with no updates or useful tracking info of any kind. Perhaps the train was ambushed."
Worst delivery service. I placed an order with Purolator quickship 3 days ago and not yet delivered. I contacted them yesterday and said they will deliver it today due to the address correction. Today they are saying they will try to deliver it on Monday. Such a worst service. Unfortunately the merchant don't use another courier company.
"I already asked Amazon to put a note to my account to NOT use Purolator, and again they did it. Now package is sitting at their distribution center with no delivery date anymore. Hate that company, having problems EVERYTIME. Can't join nobody at Purolator. Worst shipping company in Canada. Stay away from them."

"Again for the Nth time! This company never delivers any packages to me! I’m home all day and receiver unavailable? You never show up and you will say you attempted a delivery???? Every single shipment this is happening!

I don’t know why this company is still here!"
"Worst customer service ever, on hold for over 1hr+, no resolution to the problem, Was supposed to get 2 parcels, delivery guy gives me one and when I mentioned that there should be 2 parcels, he gives me a lame excuse that the 2nd parcel could have gotten put on a separate truck. I finally get confirmation from service that it was on the same truck and that he should return the same day to deliver the 2nd package, but as expected, no success. I call customer service once again and get put on hold fo over 35 minutes then the line cuts off! Call back, and again am put on hold with no response!
By far THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!"
"Ever since this company was taken over by Canada Post it has gone down hill. I tracked a package that said it was out for delivery 2 days ago, it did not arrive when i called they said to wait a couple more day, i waited, tracking said it was on the truck for delivery again and again it didn't show up, now I can't get through to anyone to discuss it.

So i contacted customer care as suggested and they did nothing either"

"I hope I can rate Purolator services to zero star. I bought some thing online. It took them two days to pick the package after label was printed. Then it showed the package in Montreal expecting up to 4 calendar day delay. When it arrives Toronto SORT facility, the 4 calendar day delay message is still there. When I tried to chat with agent, the call never went through. When I tried to chat online, the chat closed by itself. Bad services. If I find out the websites shipping via Purolator in the future, I will not order from that websites."

"If I could give negative stars I would.
Absolute joke of a ""service"".
Tried to deliver my Christmas tree - left a notice giving me the pick up location, drive all the way there to find out it's at a different location. The location they brought it to is open 9-4 Monday to Friday... Which is a joke if you have a job. I call and have them reattempt delivery since my nanny is at the home. They never showed.. and brought it back to the pick up location with god awful hours. I call to have them redirect it to a different location with hours I could actually get to without missing work.
THEY NEVER REDIRECTED IT.
So I called again and asked them AGAIN to redirect it and now? Nothing. Still at that horrible pick up location - not being redirected, and every time I try to contact them it's too busy and the useless robot chat is telling me they want to CHARGE ME MORE. Like are you serious??? Horrible, HORRIBLE company."

"Purolator is terrible! Their packages are always delayed, mostly ""due to weather conditions"" even if you order something in the middle of the summer when it does not rain at all.
They can't keep track of their packages. When you talk to their customer service, they don't know where the package is and can't give you an estimate date of delivery and ask you to literally keep staring into your computer and check if anything updates.
Their online tracking system shows outdated information - for example it tells you that the estimate date of delivery is today, when they clearly know they won't be able to make it. Either improve your tracking system or just don't provide it at all and just call people when you deliver. By the way you can't even ask to be called and give them your phone number before your package is out for delivery.
I understand that stuff happens and the logistics get impacted (like the recent BC floods). I would be totally understanding if Purolator ever properly notified me and gave me a reasonable explanation as well as proper estimates. But I guess that's too much to ask from them. Can't believe big companies like Amazon or Dell ever pick these guys."

"I should have read the customer reviews first. I don't understand how a ""ground shipment"" offered as next day ""guaranteed"" goes 350 kilometers in the exact opposite direction before claiming that the package was halted there because of weather.

"Ordered something from a store in Quebec and sent them the following e-mail.

Just received my package and all is in order.

I hope you reconsider using Purolator as your shipping company. I run my own business as well and stopped using them about 5 years ago. Terrible customer service. I have yet to have a delivery, out of dozens, go well.

They never leave the package at my home, never come when someone is home and rarely make a second attempt. I always have to drive out of my way to a secondary location to pick up my parcel. Once, I had to drive 40 minutes there and back. Today was a drive out of my way and a surly employee.

So please, stop using them. Never had a problem with UPS or Fedex.

Just saying!

Thanks. If Purolator would just deliver the package and not make it so hard to get it, but they seem to keep missing the boat. I dread when I find out they will be delivering!!!!"

You can imagine the dread when I saw purolator rather than Canada Post or UPS.
Was hoping to get it in time :/"

"If I could give less than a one star I would. I get scared every time I am getting a delivery and the sending company uses Purolator. This is the third time this year I am waiting for a parcel and it is the third time that there are delays upon delays. The only reason: the driver could not get to you in time. They promise delivery till 9pm, what they don’t tell you is the at if the driver wants to stop at 5 they can. Why not hire more than one driver per city then?? This is ridiculous. Use FedEx or UPS rather, even Canada Post is better than Purolator."

"Complete incompetence.

After 8 calls to customer support, and three different delivery attempts, guess what? I still don't have my parcel.

Drivers are not following instructions, and they have absolutely no real time contact with their dispatch.

Right hand has no idea what left hand is doing...

Complete garbage if you ask me..i would never recommend purolator....i would give you minus 10 stars if i could"

"Purolator is the worst courier in Canada.

Every single time I learn that some company has been swindled into an account with them I fear the worst.

Purolator never delivers on time, and never comes when you're home. They attempt delivery once and then make you wait 3 days as the item is shipped to their depot somewhere 15 minutes away minimum.

They could improve this, but no they continue to dump money into marketing a garbage service instead of making the service better."
I gave them 2 stars because the local delivery guy is hardworking and amazing. Unfortunately the rest of the company is useless. I normally receive 1-2 shipments a week and in the last year Purolator has managed to lose at least one box in each shipment. I just got off the phone with head office and ask them not to ship anything vital to me Purolator. Won't help me this week as I need to cancel an installation as one box of five is MIA.

"Lame excuse to lazy to use buzz me to know the box is here. Nope keep delay for 3 days row, I keep call and call where is box.. it done make me angry! Please training ur driver to proper to delivery the box or letter... I couldn't give u great review this.. it make me sooo angry with this company already!"
They couldn't go into my driveway or drop off the package because of the snow and then told me to go to a convince store to pick up my package terrible deliver don't use if you have the choice
"Hands down purolator is the worst. With one exception. His name is Jamie and he does the saskatoon out towards spiritwood leoville run. Excellent service and excellent delivery record. He is the exception to purolators long list of crappy service.
Now to today's issue at hand. I ordered a mini fridge for my 80 yr old mom on oxygen and can only use walker to get to bathroom which I put a door in-between her room and bathroom. She can't get to the kitchen. I had to go back to work so needed the fridge for her room so can leave her food and drinks. Stated delivery by 19th. Had I know when purchased that purolator was shipped I would have bought elsewhere. It was loaded onto truck 17th then got the weather notice and 22cnd says back on truck. However talked to purolator this morning and it is in warehouse in Richmond still. Maybe by this next Friday she says. So my mom should go hungry extra week nice I said. So she tries to tell me due to floods no way out of richmond. Nice try. We had a 2 day delay of our semitrucks for the event Glow at praireland that runs all through December. So I tell her obviously those trucks made it from Vancouver here. Then she says we'll large parcel volume also delay. Tells me call bestbuy see if they can replace it...but don't tell them you know trucks came through to saskatoon already!!! Why so your newest handy excuse seems credible?
Last winter I ordered a snowblower. Unfortunately purolater as well. It was week late. Then showed on truck out for delivery 3 days in a row then at depot with no updated delivery date. Called the depot and got told well they ran out of time each of those 3 days to get it delivered and now was somewhere in a storage shed out back. I said get it out I will come pick it up. Was snottily told he didn't know where in the shed and they weren't pulling out all the parcels to find one parcel. I told him get his shovel and get over and start shoveling then. He said not his fault or problem. I told him was about to be. I Googled purolator ceo list and called. Magically 2 hrs later a truck pulled up and dropped off my ""can't get it out of shed"" snowblower. The excuse for original delay was covid of course. Again crappie service for years before covid but handy excuse. Now blame floods....but somehow other transports have made it from Vancouver to saskatoon. Intelicom express has yet to let me down. The one time they made a mistake they owned it and fixed it right away. No bull excuses. Mistakes happen but when you pass out lame excuses like candy instead of solving problems then you have both awful delivery and awful service. Next time I see anything I just ordered come up with a purolator shipper I will immediately cancel the order. I will not shop with companies that use purolator anymore. WORST COURIER OUT THERE."

Packages lost or apparently returned for no reason. One has been sitting in Calgary for over a week now and they say the delay is due to 'natural disaster and weather'. There were no natural disasters between Calgary and Salmon Arm recently. What a cop out and crap company.

I was NEVER able to receive any deliveries from this company. Either I'll complain with customer support and it take extra 3-5 days to have it delivered or I walk 1:20 back and forth to the place they leave the undelivered parcels.

"Rings the buzzer once, leaves in less than 5 seconds leaving a pickup notice for pickup at the other end of the city.
It's amazing how a company can be so cartoonishly bad over so long.

"I’m expecting a package from purolator and of course the driver never come, never leave a note, just saying receiver not available at 11am when attempts. In the past I have 4-5 package delivery by this company and they are all the same experience. I’m sure the driver never reach my building, he just didn’t bother to come and write as receiver not reachable to finish his daily duties. This is the worst delivery company you would ever experience in Canada. If you are expecting package from this company, good luck by wasting lots time with their extreme busy customer service line."
"They do not deliver packages. They simply leave pick up location cards on your door and leave. They don't knock, buzz or call. This is clearly a problem because it is consistent and the reason is obvious. I had 2 packages arrive at the same time. One from Purolator and the other form an independent courier called Intelcom express. These people get paid by the package for delivery. The Intelcom guy saw the Purolator person put the sticker on as he was walking in the door to deliver my package. He told me that the Purolator guy just put on the sticker and left.
Purolator, incentivize your people otherwise they will be lazy and I don't blame them."
"Like nearly every reviewer here - I hate this company. They don’t deliver and claim nobody was home. If you are a shipper and use Purolator, I won’t buy from you. Shameful service."

"Its all in the name Pure-o-later

I have nothing but bad experiences with this company every other delivery company including mom and pop has been able to follow directions and make delivery. Not purolator if the delivery driver cant get to your front door within 15 steps good luck. If your package says call when you arrive the driver wont even bother driving past your place. Its frustrating and has happened repeatedly and looking at how many bad reviews are written here I would say I am certainly not the only one with this issue."
i order laptop from dell got ship with purolator very good
"I feel very disappointed in my experience at purolator. This is my first time to use their courier service. Actually I always at home today as well as I didn’t hang out until I received my parcel, but the terrible things is Purolator leave me message at the door and said that “we’re sorry we missed you, a receiver is unavailable” What’s wrong with it??? They were lied I was not here. Now I need to pick up on the next day intentionally. Horrible service and unprofessional. I realised that the delivery guy was slack off
or what."
If you are going to run your business make sure that your employee are following specific instruction. I am very disappointed with Purolator. Don't say that we are not available when you don't even try to contact us. Prior to the delivery i called in for a specific instruction because i need the package asap. This happens twice already. Then you left a notification with the address then email us with a different address to pick up the package. What is that?Leaving us confused and irrate. Can't take this anymore. Very disappointed.

I have had a parcel vanish 4 separate times when Purolator has been the courier. As soon as I order an item and see they are the ones handling the parcel I shake my head. Every time a parcel has vanished I call customer service. I have always been given attitude and told “ I checked the gps on the truck and it was delivered “. This company is hands down the worst. Their customer service is terrible. The lack of support is a joke. How they haven’t gone under is disappointing and mind blowing. F@!k you Purolator.

"I booked a pickup for a laptop repair and left my suite number, which was repeated back to me by the agent. The pickup never came. I checked the confirmation and no suite was entered. I called Purolator and was told the driver came but did not have the suite. They offered to rebook the pickup but I would not be in the location for 4 more days. I requested compensation as I had to bring the item to Purolator myself. The cost of the pickup was prepaid with the warranty purchased along with the laptop. The agent said as I didn't pay them directly they would not do anything. I requested an escalation and got a call. The agent wasted 15 minutes and refused to compensate me for the missed pickup."

Garbage garbage garbage garbage

In regards to Purolator reply, all the reviews about Purolator speaks for it self. I highly doubt you “looking in to it” is going to change anything"
My order from Amazon was out for delivery but was not delivered??? The explanation I received is that it was lost. How can a parcel out for delivery be lost?? I believe the driver needs to account for the loss of my parcel as I believe it was stolen! I would like the police to investigate this driver as I do not believe I am the only one who has suffered the loss of an order!!

"The WORST service I have ever experienced.

My package was delivered to Vancouver October 28. Today is november 5 and I still do not have my package.

Their excuses a messed up service? Let me break it down for you
- Friday October 29 - Status on vehicle for delivery. I was waiting all day for my shipment. In the evening the status changed to delivery failed due to Road closure. There is a construction in front of my house. Purolator havent even tried to go from the back street and drop off the package and just drove off and marked the delivery as unsucessful. interestingly enough drivers of Canada post and fedex were able to figure it out and my packages were delivered. Magic? No. Just a customer service.

- Monday Nov 1 - called them to see whats going on and how to get my package. I was asked If I can give instructions for delivery which I did (go from the back street and call me, I ll come to get a package). Of course non of this has happened

- Tuesday Nov 2 - called them again. i was that they do not see any instructions recorded with my tracking number. Also I was told that driver dont care About instructions anyway and is not going to call me (Seriously? What is this? Customer service????) and I am like ok so what I am suppose to do . And they say they can instruct driver to drop it off at the pick up location closest to my house. I confirmed the address of location several times and I was told my package will be there on Thursday Nov 4.

Thursday Nov 4 - got a notification that my package was dropped off. I came to the location we agreed to on Tuesday and guess what? My package was not there. They dropped it off at completely different location.
So I called AGAIN - I was told they made a mistake (lol really?????) and my package will be at the location I asked for tommorrow Friday Nov 5

Friday Nov 5 - just recieved a call from driver saying it wont be there today and bunch of excuses. They basically accused me of THEIR mistake saying the package was dropped off at the location closes to me (lol lol lol - the one I wanted my package to be delivered is 1 Km from my house, the other one when they actually dropped it off is almost 7km away, so whats closest?) when I argue that this is not true I was being constantly interrupted and at the End I was hung up on. Like I was talking and the person hung up. I was not vulgar, I havent used swear words. But They still hung up on me. Because I was trying to get my package and make them own their mistakes. This what PUROLATOR calls CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I dont even know when and where I can get my package :) Shame on you. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.

I will be contacting the online store where my package was shipped from to let them know the level of unprofessionalism of purolator.

do better!"

"Amazon sadly uses purolator which is honestly the worst shipping company ever. The reason they use them is beyong me. They rarely actually deliver my package and always tell me to go pick up the package. They say they missed me (I work from home, I am always at home) or they cannot find my address (although my address is correct). Drivers are simply too lazy to get out of their cars to go inside my aparment building to leave said package with the concierge and force clients to go pick up the packages. They lost packages in the past too. it is simply the worst shipping company."
"The worst delivery service there is. I made an online purchase and unfortunately the vendor decided to use Purolator. The website said I'd get my package by Nov 8th, which was okay. Purolator attempted a delivery at 10:08am on Nov 1st and let a note saying ""We're sorry we missed you"".
Come on now, how were you not going to miss me especially since you didn't make an appointment and you are delivering at home?! Wouldn't it have been more courteous (and professional) to let me know- (text, call, email... all these cheap options) so that I expect you and make the necessary arrangements?
Is this a check the box kind of thing? We came by you weren't there now come pick it up yourself?

If I had a zero star option, that's exactly what Purolator deserves"

"The most disorganized unreliable carrier service amazon uses. What they tell me on the phone never matches with the emails they send me afterwards and their customer service people never know whats going on. Tell me I can pick up my package on Tuesday, then sending me emails 2 hours later saying it was delivered when it was not. Again call customer service and all they do is shrug their shoulders and say they don't know why im getting ""package delivered"" emails.
Garbage customer service and logistical organization."

"they don't know how to shipp.
traumatizing !!!"
"I have never experienced such a poor service. One time Purolator left me a notice that my package was left at one of their pick up location and when I arrived I found out that the branch has been shut down for months. Another time it took about a week for them to get my address right and this time Purolator is unable to deliver a simple TV saying it’s an overweight item. I was promised a guaranteed delivery 3 days ago and there is no update on their website and nobody can tell me when it will be delivered. Their customer servise is pathetic, their employees sound annoyed the minute they answer the phone and give you no information whatsoever. The tracking updates are inaccurate and all you hear from the company are excuses. Purolator should be out of business and I do NOT recommend to use this carrier to any company out there."

"Awful in every sense, does not attempt to deliver packages and wastes your time to fix their screwups.

Only responds to provide the lip-service appearance of customer support. Their terrible practices are too consistent not to be intentional. Almost no deliveries attempted, they expect you to go chase the package down or go on hold for their phone ""support"". Their business model is designed to waste your time. I tell every business that we won't accept shipment by Purolator. They can find another shipper or lose the business."
"Purolator is easily the worst of the worst. They should be out of business based on their performance. This is a message to all online businesses, I will avoid shopping at your businesses if I know that you use Purolator to ship your packages."

"Purolator has truly the worst customer service I have ever experienced. In two different occasions, I called them multiple times to ask why the driver said they tried to deliver my package although I never witnessed it while being at the place of delivery ALL DAY… they never gave me an explanation and said that drivers are very busy so they don’t waste time trying to deliver a package (when that is literally their job).
I basically spent way more money than I was planning to going to pick up the package after they said they’d deliver it since I offered detailed instructions so that they’d have no excuse to say they tried to deliver it and I wasn’t home.
Terrible service, very disappointing."

"This morning I had a very bad experience with the delivery driver from Purolator (Truck Plate # BN 17893) coming to my building. I was inquiring about an expected deilvery since I just approach to the front entrance and saw him jumping to his truck and not wanting to miss the shipment I asked him for package addressee info to see if he had any for me as I gave him my name and unit #. He was very rude and had no patience to hear me out. If I can avoid Purolator, I will."
I bought some expensive vitamin c powder & magnesium pills from England. It ended up with Purolator unfortunately. Parcel went to sort facility in Ottawa and is now somehow lost. They are incompetent scum and won't do anything for losing my package and costing me a bunch of money. They need to be put out of business!!
"January 2021 Purolator picked up a parcel from a supplier to be delivered 3.5 km. to me. 22 lbs. and bigger than a breadbox. 7 - 10 days. The justification - it was large.

October 2021 Purolator picked up a parcel from a supplier to be delivered 9.4 km. to me, the next day. 71 lbs. and bigger than a breadbox. 5+ days? The justification - it was heavy.

After picking up this ""too heavy"" package and taking it to the Toronto sort centre, within 1 hour they handed it off to a 3rd party. Purolator customer service didn't even know who the 3rd party was saying ""only the depot knows"".

This is a very sad state of affairs. I don't buy their excuses and believe that if you can't deliver then be adult enough to admit it and don't pick up things, from the supplier, that you can't deliver on time.

Handing your job off to a 3rd party does not absolve you of your responsibilities.

In both cases Purolator, knowing full well that they wouldn't be delivering it on time, did not notify me, or the supplier, of any delays. I had to message and call to even get an answer and/or clarification."
"Hello Vid, thank you for taking the time to write this review. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this situation.
All heavyweight and oversized shipments have an additional 4 business days delay, due to the special handling they require. This information is provided on our track site. The shipper is also aware of this policy that was installed at the start of the pandemic, due to high volumes. You can subscribe to email notification to be alerted as soon as the status changes. The reason why we do not provide the name and info about the third party delivery agent is that we remain in charge of the customer service. It’s still us you have to reach out to for any questions.

I’d rather drag my nuts through shards of glass than use Purolator shipping ever again. Anytime I see Purolator shipping when I order Amazon I immediately just cancel my order because it’s not worth it these people are absolutely insane and they are a liars. They say attempt delivery when in fact they haven’t even stepped out of their truck. I waited at home for two days constantly looking out my apartment window to see a Purolator truck and then all of a sudden I get an email saying attempted delivery and no one actually came so they either just sit in the truck and drive by peoples houses and lie or they are just ghosts. I’m convinced these people don’t even exist or there’s just ghosts driving their vehicles my boyfriend never believed in ghosts but he’s started to believe in them now. The customer service is complete trash every single person we spoke to about our delivery was completely rude and talked to me as if I was on the spectrum. Who would want to work for Purolator when all they do is probably just get complaints all day. Whenever I order From Amazon and I see that Purolator is the shipper I wait until it says out for delivery and then just cancel my order so they can get a taste of their own crap. RIP Purolator not sure how long you’re going to last.

"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had in shipping. I almost feel sorry for the customer service reps who have to explain why Purolator sucks so badly. Same experience others have documented - ""attempted delivery"", followed by ""good news! Your package is ready for pickup!"" notifications - at a location that is a 40 mile round trip from where I live. As many others have said - I would give it 0 stars if I could. If you see your package is being shipped via Purolator, you might as well go ahead and start the refund process to try and get ahead of the curve."

"A package that was flagged for signature upon delivery was in fact delivered, to the wrong house (eight houses down the street) and without signature! An email stated the package was in fact ""delivered"" to my home, but no signature was required / obtained. A claim was opened, but I was informed by support that since the package was ""successfully delivered"", albeit to the wrong house I may not be able to claim the $275 loss. Luckily, I have good neighbours who ensured it was delivered to my door. This isn't the first issue I've encountered with Purolator, but I can guarantee it will be the last as I will take my business elsewhere. I would give zero stars, but sadly that isn't an option to choose from."

"I would give them ZERO if I could. I called them 2 days in a row regarding my package, including the morning of the day it was first attempted to be delivered. I could see from the tracking that it was being delivered. I let them know the buzzer doesnt work and that to call me on arrival. At which point the lady who answered told me that it wouldn't be delivered for another 2 days. I asked her are you sure? I can see here it says its being delivered today, and so she doubled down and say yes she is sure. Well guess what happened the next morning? I got a call from them to tell me they tried to deliver the package. Just an unbelievably terrible company. Stay away from them if you can at all COST. defines logic how these people run their business."

"Once again my Amazon.ca order is late thanks to Purolator. Why on earth does Amazon continue to use this incompetent carrier. When you pay for prime and it is always late when Purolator is the carrier and you stay home all day because they say they need a signature it is very annoying.
After calling customer service I was told it could now take 4 business days to be delivered. When I complained that this was poor service and it happens regularly with Purolator I was told By a Purolator customer service rep. That I should tell Amazon not to ship my parcels by Purolator anymore. Wow!!!"

This was supposed to be a speedy delivery, but it's been over 9 days now since expected delivery date and I am yet to receive it. They keep recording attempted delivery with no real attempt.

"I am sorry but how the F are you guys still in business....

My package was sent, Purolator never informs me of it.
A few days pass, I call to check and they tell me it was delivered to a Mail box.
I tell them that I never got it and they must have left it somewhere and someone stole it.
They tell me they are sorry but there is nothing they can do since they delivered it.

I have never had an issue with Amazon... never but these guys ...

This a reply to Vanessa.
Your driver never even attempted to call the buzzer code downstairs and he left my delivery god knows where.
It was stolen and now you guys are refusing to do anything about it.
That was the conclusion that I got from the last email you sent me."

Unbelievable horrible shipping service. 14 day delay and then one missed attempt to deliver. I now have to drive 20 km to package facility. I will boycott any company using this shipment method.
"This is the stupidest type of delivery i have seen. They came in the main entrance of my apartment, not even to my room door and left a note at the main entrance of the building saying i have missed the package. Am i supposed to stay outside of my building from 8am to 9pm waiting for it? Why cant they call the customers? It's common sense and every other delivery companies does it. So stupid.

"Ridiculous company, a joke at best.
I placed an order for a delivery on sep 29, 2021.
It was 4 boxes. They ""attempted"" a delivery to the addressee and then just dropped the boxes at pinguinpickup without leaving a note or otherwise informing us of the delivery. Only when i called in they bothered to let me know. Is that how they provide the service customers paid for????
And the story doesnt end here. Of 4 boxes, they only delivered 3. The 4th missing box- they cant even advise where it is.They received all boxes at the same time, and while they saw boxes 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, it never even caused them to think where is the fourth box in the shipment and why it is missing. I was only informed of this by the addressee that the next day delivery was still not delivered 10 days after. I called them on Oct 7 and nobody was able to tell me where the box is. Again, it was supposed to be the next day delivery, meaning the order was supposed to be delievered on Sep 30. Not only they did not fulfill their order, the service they were paid for, they didn't bother to deal with the missing package at all. They only started working on it when apparently push came to shove. Only when the customer called in they slowly started to working on it. In other words, they did not fulfill the service and didn't do anything about it in hopes that the customer won't notice-? and they can get away with it-?
Other than that I can not think of any reason why they didn't finish the order and decided to leave it hanging. When on Oct 7 I called, only then they decided to start doing smth about it, and they told me ""good that you called so we can start the investigation"". You should have started the investigation regardless of my call if you didn't fulfil the order. The packaged has been missing for 2 weeks now and they still didn't do anything about it. Only ""oh, we started the investigation, our investigation specialist will call you"". You called a couple of times and inquired of the status - well, we started the investigation and within 2 days - still no progress, we kept the status quo, but we started the investigation, it is all in our notes! Obviously, the brightest minds of the humanity work at purolator. ""Our specialists work from 9 to 5"". Well, it is Tuesday Oct 12, 9.25AM, the so-called investigation has been opened for 3 days already and still nothing happened. You were told that this is urgent, the package has been missing for 14 days now, and still nothing was done about it."

"I wish there was a way to give them 0 stars.
Purolator is undeniably the worst deliverer in Canada.

Two days ago I had my amazon package carried by Purolator, and I am still waiting for it after 4failed delivery attempts while I was at home and they shamelessly labeled it wrong address while I have been using the same address for 2years and received several deliveries by them before."
I was at home looking for my package but find out they case and put the paper at the door that you’re not available.This is ridiculous.

"I supposed to have a Purolator package courier to my company address. It got lost and mis-delivered somewhere else (the package suppose to require a signature upon delivery). My company requested a package trace immediately and little to nothing was heard for a week (Myself and company called everyday). Funny that on Wednesday the company email me if there's any progress with the package and whether it suddenly re-appear. On Friday i received an email saying package was lost and file is closed (I suspect this was a standard template as the font and style on my name and the rest of text were different). I am not so sure what kind of search they have performed.

All those amazing slogan.... every package is a promise.... reliable delivery.. delivering a better tomorrow..... sigh....

"Good Costumer service to help out as much as they could but tracking needs to be updated so as to not make me think that my package would arrive when it was supposed to, still waiting on that package. But now due to delay it will not arrive till Tuesday or probably later. Shame my tracking was not updated since the 5th to let me know the bad news. Last time I ordered something that shipped via Purolator it was updated whenever something changed in my order. I did reach out and costumer support was very nice, but the tracking on your website should be fixed. And should say that my package is delayed. Was looking forward to playing my new game this weekend, but now will have to wait till Tuesday"

"Delphine from Purolator's Social Media Customer Care Section reached out to me 13 minutes after my original One Star review for Purolator's delivery service. The Customer Care Section was thoroughly professional and worked to resolve my delivery problem.
My package arrived at my apartment door this Friday late morning. The Social Media Customer Care Section of Purolator gets 5 Stars from me. If the Delivery Section and the Agents handling the Service section were as professional, Purolator would have gotten a much better positive review.

Because of the vastly different service I got from Purolator, I have revised my final review to 3 stars, balancing the two.

My original review stands as follows:

Worst delivery service I have ever encountered. Basically to the point where if I knew the company I am ordering from is using Purolator, I would definitely not purchase from them.
My Purolator nightmare is still on going and I have no idea if it will ever be resolved. Shipment I ordered from Michaels was split into two packages, one arrived okay. The other shipment encountered mechanical problems on Monday, its scheduled delivery day and there would be a delay. Since I signed up for all notifications and am especially vigilant since this was Purolator, I was on top of this and called Purolator on Monday to request for delivery on Wednesday instead as Tuesday was the one day I had a medical appointment on and to make sure it would not arrive on Tuesday
Well, of course delivery was attempted on Tuesday and I was left with the Purolator notice that my package was now left for pick up
The whole reason I had requested Wednesday delivery was because I have no transport and am on a walker. It is impossible for me to drag the parcel from the pick up point back uphill to my home.

I called Purolator again and was assured that package was on van for re-delivery to me Wednesday morning. However when I checked again, later in the day, I saw that it said its held for pick up at pick up location. So called Purolator again and was told that the previous two agents I spoke to, did not do a proper job and I should have been told re-delivery would need to be approved.
So, this time, the 3rd agent told me, he had put up a note on this matter on file and that on Thursday, my package would be picked up to return to sort facility and if I am lucky, it would be sent to me same day, but if not, on Friday for sure, package would be on the van out to me

Well, on Thursday, I went to check if my package had been picked up to return to sort facility but of course it had not. It is still being held for pick up

I once again called Purolator and spoke to the 4th agent and this time he told me that the driver at the pick up location said my apartment buzzer was not working. I have no idea why it would not be working for Purolator when Fed EX and Amazon had no problems using the buzzer and delivering packages to me this last Wednesday and today, Thursday.
Purolator driver must be something special.

Anyhow, this 4th agent, managed to contact pick up point and requested for a redelivery and told me its too late for Thursday but they would deliver on Friday

Shortly after, a 5th Purolator agent called to say that driver has finished his rounds for my area and earliest delivery would be next week Tuesday and suggested that I go to pick up location to pick it up myself!

By which point, I told the agent that I am beyond frustrated and if it cannot be re-delivered to me come Tuesday, Wednesday whatever, next week, they can send it back to the sender.

I have never had an experience as bad as this with any courier company. I would never use Purolator myself and again, if I knew Purolator is the delivery service the company I am shopping from is using, I would definitely forgo the shopping or find another store to purchase from."

"Purolator is a joke. I ordered something off amazon to be delivered to my sister. My sister has a doorbell camera with motion sensor that sends notifications and gives live streaming to her phone. Purolator claimed they delivered the package oct 7th 2021, they day it is suppose to be delivered. Their tracking system is a joke cause the tracking info is all wrong. Shows as being delivered to the addess but lists a completely different city. No one from purolator showed up to their door yesterday. There was no note left nor package. There was no notification from the doorcam that anyone shower up. After filing a complaint with purolator. Today their driver shows up looking in my sisters mailbox and then leaves. A few hours later, the driver comes back and shocking, has the package and delivers it. Someone needs to step in and reorganize how purolator is run or shut them down. They are disorganized, dishonest and they dont believe in doing whats right for customers."
"Package picked up by Purolator on Sunday. Last update is that it arrived at the sorting facility later that day. It's now Thursday. Its scheduled for delivery tomorrow. No updates showing it has left the sorting facility. Spoke to customer service. They couldn't tell me anything other than what was written on the tracking site. I pressed for more info as to why they don't list when a package has left the sorting facility towards its destination - ""Sometimes we don't update with departure times""

Literally every other courier and mail service lists when it arrives and departs a sorting facility. Including Canada Post, which owns most of Purolator.

Between the lack of updates and the abysmal delivery attempts, it's astounding to me that folks still pay to use Purolator. I wonder if I'm the only one that feels dread every time I see a vendor has shipped my package via Purolator. Please try to do better."

"a great service, package always arrive on time and in good condition. a little expensive but at the end its better than having to drive it there myself."
I hate puraltor so much everytime they will say they brought the package to the building and no one was there and they have never even called me to say anything that they dropped it I don’t know why they can’t just drop my package at the door instead of me going to their company and pick it up

"This is an edited review following the good communication with Delphine, Social Media Coordinator at Purolator.
I ordered last week four dining chairs from Wayfair.ca. The items were in stock in the Toronto warehouse and I received a notification that the items were picked up by Purolator the next day (Oct 01) On Monday (Oct 04) the tracking was updated with a shipping delay due to missed connection. On Oct the 6th the two packages went out for delivery from Guelph just to update later that ""special handling"" is required and delivery will be delayed up to 4 calendar days. I expressed my discontent through a one star review first however I got immediately contacted by Purolator to ask for details and a tracking number. Turned out, at the end, that the parcel was still on its way however there was a glitch in the communication between a 3rd party delivery agent and Purolator."

"Atrocious.
Took a week with my parcel in town to ""attempt"" delivery. I was in the livingroom at the time - no bell, just the classic leave note and run.
In writing and on their website I was informed I could pickup parcel 4 days later.
I went down (16 km round trip) to pickup. ""I don't know where it is"". I cant find it. Must be at Sargeant location"".
Called later that afternoon. ""It's here come and get it. Another 16 km. Arrived and ""We can't find it"". They then asked me to go in the back and look for a package I have never seen. Utterly inappropriate. Then they said ""it must be somewhere else"". Got a call later in the day. ""We found it under some stuff - it was here all along.""
Then they offered to deliver it the next day - guarrenteed.
Next day - no delivery
Day after - no delivery.
Website says its back at the ""sorting centre""...

This is an incompetent and dishonest organization.
I will no longer do any business with companies employing this organization and informed multiple vendors."
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY LEFT MY PACKAGE OUTSIDE MY FRONT DOOR ! I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THERE SERVICE!

"Ordered a keyboard on Amazon with prime, delivery was suppose to be on sunday, but it still hasn't arrived yet. I mean if its delayed, atleast provide information on whats going on. The last time they updated the tracking information was on Sunday at 3am. Last day of waiting for them to deliver.... Sad that Purolator was never this lack on communication 5-7 years ago."
"""sorry we missed you"" Yes it was my fault for being home and not in the middle of the highway waiting for their truck. And they want me to go to them. If I had a car I wouldn't be asking for delivery.
I'm beyond furious for waiting 5 days for a delivery just to get this note, they didn't call or even try...
Edit: sent an email to customer care, if anything good comes out of it I will update the review.
Customer care said a redelivery is scheduled for Wednesday, and that they would call me. I waited all day Wednesday for it, kept the phone close and got paranoid about leaving the house in case they showed. And of course they did not show.
They actually managed to make this situation worse."
"Great in person and over the phone customer service. the delivery man even went all the way up t the 16th floor to pickup my shipment. the only thing I would love, is the option to have them print out the shipping labels for returns. Even if their were a small fee."
"Wish there is less than 1 star rating. They don't call, don't respond to calls and ask you to pick up an item with the excuse of ""sorry we missed you"""

"I have had hundreds of Amazon orders shipped to my home, and they are ALWAYS left at safe location front door (no signature required) if I am not home at time. Single exception was Purolator (for cheap $10 item), and doing some digging on the internet, it seems the reason why Purolator never seems to just leave the package at door like all the other couriers, is that Purolator uses the OPT OUT method when the shipping label is created. The box with ""Signature Required"" is checked off by default, whereas all other couriers use OPT IN, where the box is unchecked by default. Not only a very sneaky slimy way for Purolator to slip in an extra $1-2 per shipment to the shipper, but also causes delays for the customer and/or requiring item be picked up at Purolator depot. Trustpilot needs to provide 0 star option for clown operations like Purolator"
"I ordered from best buy and the package was supposed to come September 27th but no updates have been made and it just says ""shipping label has been created"" for the past few days. I have no clue when I'll get my package."

The customer service attitude on the phone was very rude.
"They do not follow the delivery instructions and leave a pickup notice which is worst if you are expecting a delivery on Fridays.
worst service, waited till Monday for the order to be delivered on Wednesday then Friday. Go for pickups drivers do not follow the instructions
Not recommended."

"I swore myself I would not use Purolator ever again, if I had known I would not have ordered from Best Buy, but here we are...

In an attempt to fill the ""No signature"" Form, I contacted customer service 4 times (2 by phone, 2 by chat) The phone hung up on me after a few minutes of being on hold, and the chat disconnects mid talking to an agent with the notice: ""You have been disconnected. There are no agents available.""

I am very anxious because, from personal experience, they do not try to attempt delivery and only leave a ""sorry we missed you"" note, then you are stuck to go pick up your package yourself at a ridiculously far facility, to which I absolutely have no way to access."

My package did not arrive. Purolator customer service told me it will arrive Friday. On Friday it still did not arrive. Purolator customer service told me it will arrive on Monday. On Monday it still did not arrive. Purolator customer service told me it will arrive on Tuesday. On Tuesday it still did not arrive. Purolator customer service told me it definitely will arrive on Wednesday. On Wednesday it STILL DID NOT ARRIVE. Now Purolator customer service tells me it will arrive on Friday or on Monday. LIES
"lol... why am i even reviewing purolator. They should be defunct. a useless delivery service at its best of times. Every time I have an order being delivered by purolator from Amazon. I know it will be late or not delivered at all. I am baffled as to why Amazon uses this company at all. You would think Amazon would regard its customers, and not let them go through the hassle of waiting for a package that might not even come."
"This guys are the worst delivery service available on earth. This is the bizillion time they dont even attempt to deliver and they leave an update sayng delivery attempted. I was like always at my home, my bell works perfectly and this lazy pieves of sh... dont deliver. Now I have ot go to buttfu... nowhere to pick up my package. Thanks for NOTHING!"
"Would have given them a minus 5 star if there is that option.Worst service ever.I dont know why they are still in business.I received an email Monday morning around 8 that my parcel is out for delivery.I drove home from my work and waited 2 hours from 11am to 1:15pm.They came and left a note about a missed delivery at 2:15.I sent my husband to pick up the parcel the next day,Purolator didnt release the parcel even he has the ID for pick up requirement.It was so clear written in there website of what needs to bring when doing pick ups for missed delivery.Purolator made it so difficult.Even me as a recepient going there showing bank statement showing my current address which is the same as in the parcel,as proof of residence coz I didnt updated my driver's license address yet,was not able to get the parcel.It is frustrating not only because of the time wasted calling the purolator customer service and the time i spent driving there and missing my lunch break,its frustrating coz they were unreasonable and they have crappy rules.Purolator customer service assured me this morning that i could definitely pick up my parcel having those ID requirements with me to bring along.Purolator located at Creditstone,Vaughan.They have issues of understanding their rules on ID requirements for pick ups.Purolator please do re-train employees to be more reasonable and logical."

The worst service ever
For 7 days I have been told that my package is on the way ,,, then delivered to the wrong address, and the last day I was told that my package is in the delivery cmion to be told 1 week later that my package is still at the depot
This is the birthday present to my daughter and she has been crying since Friday

Driver made no attempt to deliver. Put note on door and left.
"Where do I even begin, I ordered something from a website and they have me a Purolator tracking number. And I knew that they will screw it up, so my order was placed on Monday early morning with 2-3 day ground shipping.

So I get an email that my package is delayed because it missed a ""connection"" and won't reach on Thursday. Now the new delivery day is Friday (today), however they have my address wrong. So in from of my home address it says ""Is *** ******"" (my home address) I don't get how you can accept an address which is wrong?

Ok that is not even the worst part, after waiting for 40 min to get to customer care on Thursdays I gave them the correct address and they assured me that it will be delivered today.

Surprise, surprise my order ""went out for delivery"" and at 4.20 pm local time I get an email update ""wrong address on the order, please contact customer care"". Now I call them again and wait for another 57 min to get a representative on call. They said "" I have a wrong address and they have no idea who I talked too and they didn't update the address!""

But wait there is more!!!!!!!!!
So the new rep said the best he can do is ""set the newly delivery date to Monday"" and I offered to drive 34km one way to puck my package if I can get it today?! He put me on another 25 min hold to talk to his manager, his manager comes on and gives me another NEWS!

My package address can not be changed because of the agreement in place with the seller, so her recommendations was to call the original buyer and ask him ""To ship me a new package as this will take longer to sort out, and would be better to place a new order and pay for express shipping""....

Wait what??? So after delaying my order now your recommendation is to spend more money and pay more to Purolator so they can ship it fast because they messed up the delivery and can't fix it soon enough??? How is this company still in business?? They have more than 90% reviews below 1 start and all they do is mess up orders regularly?

I am a reasonable individual, and I understand right now labor market is struggling and it's hard to find people to work. However, if the top management have to implement proper procedures in place. Atleast that would help make front line staff and workers life MUCH EASIER!!!! And they won't have to deal with angry and pissed off customer. If you can't do that, may be it is good that a company like Amazon is entering shipping and logistics industry to be a 3rd party delivery company. As they know what customer service and a delivery company is and supposed to be like.
I am sorry Purolator, but you are the worst company in delivery and logistics. You are the cause of your employees leaving and being disrespected daily!"
"Purolator said they could not find my residence. Come on in this day and age of GPS.
I will be checking with any company I order from on line and if they use Purolator I will cancel my order."
Every single time I have a package to receive from this company it always arrive a day later! They lied about it they were here to deliver! Very poor delivery service! they don’t even call when they arrived. How are we suppose to know when to be alert to receive our package! Very garbage services from this company! Jeez man I’m tired of facing the same issue over and over! All other company call or alert you! Only this company giving this same exact issue every single time! I’m tired of this poor services every single time!

WE'RE IN HOME TODAY AND THEY JUST LEFT WITH NOT EVEN A CALL.

I had problems when I purchase item from Bestbuy, from London Drugs, from Amazon.ca, and I'd never even even in a glicth of mind recommend this company to no one. They cheat on you, lie about delivers and the customer service is just the worst I ever saw. DON'T USE PUROLATOR."

I am a Bloomex customer who use Purolator to deliver their floral arrangements. Purolator has an agreement with Bloomex that waives responsibility for the condition of the flowers when they arrive because they know their trucks and delivery times are not appropriate for flower delivery. Purolator pickup up and transported my flowers from North York to North Bay (over 300km) during a 30 degree heatwave. It took half a day... my flowers were put in their warehouse and not supposed to be delivered until Monday. That would have made them a floral soup. They do not have refrigerated trucks. When I complained to Bloomex and wanted a refund they said 'No' because it was Purolators fault. When I contacted Purolator they said it was Bloomex's Fault. Purolator is fully aware that they are unable to transport perishable items which is why they have Bloomex sign a waiver of responsibility. Thing is... this means Purolator is under no obligation to try and get the flowers there on time or in good condition. Bloomex now refuses all refunds. So.... have a look at the many Market Place Exposes and Purolators role in the Bloomex scandal and the Bloomex Sucks FB page before you decide to order from either company. Eventually... I got my refund... but I was told it was on the last day that refunds were going to be available. When I made my order with Bloomex it said a Local North Bay Florist would be used... they were not and I was not told that Purolator would be used. Bloomex used Purolator to transport the arrangement hundreds of km's in a heat wave and had my arrangement for FIVE days during that heat wave. You are darn right Purolator and its drivers / employees know what they are doing. Shame on you Purolator!!!! My daughter never did get flowers for her birthday because of you. You knew when you picked them up what would happen. Thanks for ruining her day. She was completely alone in North Bay due to work - the flowers were meant to cheer up her room.

Was home all day on the date the courier supposedly arrived but my doorbell didn’t ring and no note was left to say he/she had been there. Two days later I get a text saying that my package can be picked up (15 minute drive away). Went online to request a second delivery attempt but this did not happen. Ended up picking up my parcel and was left feeling that this company features poor service and communications. Not the first time I’ve seen them do this. Sad to see a Canadian company that is so pathetic!
"I wish I could give 0 star ,as with active correspondence they send my package on same day I mentioned again and again that I will not be available and then place my package for pickup in another city .what a joke .very bad service."

"Very disappointed with this courier service. Twice now this same Purolator service has delivered our parcel to the wrong address on the east side of our very small town. Our address is on the west side and our house number easy to see. The wrong address doesn’t even have a house number!
When i called purolator to say the package was in fact not delivered (i was sitting outside so i knew it wasn’t stolen) I was told that they honour whatever the driver tells them.
The last time this happened it was 3 months before the wrong addressee brought the package to my door.
In the future we will not order from any online service that uses Purolator courier. In the current times when ordering online is the safest way to shop, Purolator needs to up its game."
"Worst ever service time and again! If at all possible, please try to avoid at all cost.

Several times in the past, they did not deliver packages citing incorrect address/missing information while others were able to deliver on time, and I had to personally collect it from their center. This time, it was again not delivered with same reason. When I contacted to get it picked up personally, I was told that they will hold it in their centre and I will be able to pick it up by today. I contacted the customer care 3 times to confirm the same. However to my utter surprise, I received an update citing that I need to make an appointment to get it delivered, and there was no mention of the pickup service I requested. Totally confused with no updates and no information whatsoever with the current status of my package. Worst ever service. not recommended at all!!!

[Update @3:49pm CDT 9/20/2021 post Purolator customer care reply]
I have emailed back with the details to Purolator customer care in the email id provided, and waiting for a response.

[**Update @7:00pm CDT 9/20/2021**] This is why I term Purolator service as most unprofessional and unworthy. In order to get attention that they are responding to customer complaints; just after I posted my experience, their customer relationship team posted publicly in this review, that they want me to send in the details, so that they can update me about the status. I did the same, I got a general reply from them as below ""We were unable to complete the delivery on Sept 18th as we didn’t have your buzzer code. A request to have this held for pickup was sent on the 18th, and will be processed by the end of the day today, not over the weekend. As soon as its ready for pickup, the status will be updated."" This update I already received from their customer care team, although the website shows different status.
However, now being end of day, nobody from their team cares to send an update!!! Its so frustrating and completely puts in doubt the company is operating its day to day business!!!!! Totally unacceptable! Avoid at all cost, if possible."

"Worst experience I'm having by far and I am not happy. I have been waiting for my package delivery for 2 days already, all day. On the first day I got a notice at 8:57pm that they attempted a delivery, but I was waiting for a delivery truck to come till 9:30pm.. On the second day I got a notice that my package has been successfully been delivered... I did not get any package nor they left my package outside my door... I talked to an operator and they will get back to me in a couple of days with a trace case. All these delivery drivers need to do their job properly, paid to work."

"Horrible experience with Purolator. They were supposed to schedule a drop off for me and the parcel sat in the same city for 6 days, all the while the service agents told me that I could expect the parcel 'tomorrow' each of those 6 days. Poor service and poor logistics."
"I was going to write out my tale of woe with Purolator in detail but after looking at a few recent reviews, I see that there is nothing novel about my experience. Very briefly, I had an envelope shipped express from Toronto to Vancouver last Friday. A note was left on my door on Sunday saying that delivery had been attempted and I could pick it up the next day at a local store...Michaels on W Broadway. I walked to Michaels and was told that it wasn't there, it had gone to the Richmond Depot. Called Purolator and they asked if I could pick it up in Richmond....miles away from my home. I said no, I don't have hours to spend because you made a error---please deliver it to me--or at the very least to Michaels asap. They said they didn't think they could do that the next day but they'd try the following one. It didn't come within two days so I phoned again...they apologized but said it may take another two days to get to me. The terminal there is very busy and running behind they said, apparently to make me feel better. It would have been faster and more efficient...and a fraction of the cost and frustration...to have sent it by regular Canada Post mail. If Purolator can't clear the backlog in its depots it should stop accepting parcels until it can---it's soliciting and accepting money for a service it has no ability to deliver. I'm not a lawyer but I'm pretty sure that's fraudulent. Finally, please don't respond Purolater with a comment asking me to send my tracking number so you can resolve the issue...every time I've phoned I've provided that. Please just clean up your operation or close down your business.
Update: Purolator did not deliver the parcel within the second two day period either, despite the second promise. I called and the parcel is being shipped back to the sender, the two promises over the phone to make good on their earlier mistake notwithstanding. I called again and after 40 min on the phone the Purolator rep. said they will try to prevent the return shipment. We'll see."

"This company is a literal joke with no accountability. Who came up with the idea of setting up a new system that’s different than every other carrier? You think you are cool? No, you are a f***ing joke.

1. No ring on the door bell, leaves no slip at the door. And it asks me to schedule another delivery with the driver. (If I didn’t check the tracking I would’ve never known)
2. I called to get them to send to depot, and follows up everyday. They manage to mess it up every morning without fail, I still don’t have a clear idea which depot this ended up in
3. They are the only company that asks for proof of address regardless of you having a slip or not. This doesn’t protect anybody, it’s arbitrarily put on so they can be different or be a hipster.

Give, me, my package please. I’ll literally drive around the city to find your truck if it makes your lives easier. Give me any ****ing solution. I’m sick and tired of you delaying it every single day. I need that package to work??????"
"Ok, so I ordered socks from Vans at the end of June this year. A couple days later, I was updated that the package was picked up, and was for some reason in Toronto. (even though the socks originated in California??) Then, on July 5th, I was told that the package would be delayed due to a “packaging issue” WITH SOCKS. How do you mess up packaging for socks I don’t know, but it happened. Well, it’s been well over 2 months since then, I have received 0 updates, 0 emails, absolutely nothing. The socks are still sitting in Toronto, across the country, because apparently it’s too hard to repackage some socks. Never going through PUROLATOR again, although I didn’t have a choice in this regard."

"I think they doesn't even deserve a star but Trustpilot only allow us to give 1 star out of 5.

Firstly they are not even ring your bell just silently left the label so even if you are home you need to drive their center. When you got there you will understand their scam. There are bunch of packages waiting to be scanned because they never even deliver one package. They just leave a note and take them to the delivery points.

Secondly, I can drive with my international driver license but according to them it doesn't considered as an government issued ID. Sorry but I'm not gonna go to downtown sketchy convenience store with my passport. Even the neighbourhood was dangerous.

Stick with CanadaPost. If they left a note at least you can go to closest shoppers instead of sketchy places."

"This is the second time that Purolator delivered my order, and just like the first time, it is as though the person delivering it doesn't know what they are doing. On both occasions, the tracker said -Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible- even though I provided instructions. There was no call, not even a notice/note left to tell me where I could pick up my delivery. My first package was delivered randomly without any notification after how many days. Now, my second delivery seems to be going the same route. Called customer service and they said they'll try to get it shipped out again tomorrow or the day after. If there was an option to choose which delivery company gets to deliver my orders, I'd definitely remove Purolator from the list of options"

Worst delivery experiment. I ordered an item from Best Buy and they sent by Purolator. As it was a heavy item it stayed in the facility for a few days until it went to authorized agent to call and make an appointment for delivery(all is based on what it is written on their website for tracking the item). We waited for a couple of days for the phone call and on last Friday Sep 10 they sound the entry buzzer for delivery. Funny thing is that we had the call exactly 5 minutes before the buzzer. As nobody was home to receive the item they took it back. I called the agent/driver who left us message in the afternoon after getting back home and he said they are going to deliver it today Sep 13 after 3 pm but it was all words. They did not scan the item or whatever they have to do to update the website to show what is happening and still no delivery at 9 pm. God knows where the item is. Apparently the customer's time and need is not much of importance for them and who is responsible enough to answer and find out what is going on?

"Btw looking at all the replies, I see an automatic same formatted message, so I don't expect any resolution from Purolator. The customer care had a rude way of informing you that it is your mistake, dilusion. I always wish if I could know which courier company would Amazon choose to deliver my product, so that when I see Purolator as my only option, I can cancel the shopping.
Not a single package was delivered to me by Purolator without multiple follow-ups, majority times me ending up cancelling the product or picking up from the site. I was in one such situation in July and now today they dropped me a message that I missed the delivery so I need to pickup - pure rubbish. So the person never visits my building, so just an sms eod that failed attempt so pick up from the location. This defeats the whole purpose of home delivery - lazy delivery guys. So I ordered two items, one was from Canada post and another by Purolator. Both were showing to be delivered today almost same time. Canada post made it to my door step but Purolator, like always missed delivery. Indoor of me paying for home delivery, I need to go pickup from another location. Wish this company never existed on earth, home delivery experience would have been less stressful.
Fyi: package ID # is MWG003893570"

"Purolator drivers lack common sense.
I had a package left by their driver in the vestibule of the lobby of my condo building. This building has about 500 residents. Obviously my package was stolen.
There was no attempt to contact me.
The shipper resends the package and I check the tracking to see if I can divert the package to a pickup location. I even spoke to customer service who called me to confirm where to send my package. It never gets updated and i only get an email saying ""sorry we couldn't deliver, we've transferred this to another courier"". A week goes by with no updates, and customer service also had no information. Today I get a notice that my order was delivered, but where? They sent back to the shipper. They claim that they couldn't deliver to my condo, they brought it to a pickup place and it wasn't claimed. I never received an email or call about this. (Yes i'm signed up and have received other emails. Their customer support was kind enough to treat me like a child and make me confirm signing up AND check my spam).

So basically my package was sent twice and I didn't receive it. I contact them and it's no help.
Now the store will only refund the part that they sent via purolator. But not the useless parts that ended up getting shipped and received from FedEx.
In the end, Purolator has cost me $35, and way too much of my time dealing with this.
Their customer support was unhelpful, and condescending. They repeated ""Please sign up with your email for updates"" about 3 times in 1 chat. Please do better. You waste people's time and money. Train your support team, train your drivers."

"Package supposed to be delivered on three separate occasions.

PACKAGE STORY & INTRO: I live in a basement and there are 2 doors that you have to open before you can reach the basement doors. So, it is basically an apartment as it has separate entrance (this is important as the rep saying that the driver only calls if they do not know the apartment# or buzz code). For the third time Purolator just leaving the: ""We're sorry we missed you"" note and I am not receiving the package.

I explained to the representative directions to knock my doors & that the driver has to call/notify me about the delivery. When I am calling to find out why package has not been delivered for the third time, the rep is saying: ""you know, drivers are extremely busy..."". Erm... If your driver cannot call the customer, they have to be able to notify the customer somehow WHEN they are delivering the package. If the customer is not outside waiting for you the whole day, there is no way you will deliver the package.

COMPANY's SOLUTION: ""We will schedule a delivery and see how it goes"".

REAL SOLUTION: Add YOUR DELIVERY IS HERE option for your drivers. I received a MISSED DELIEVERY text message three times. Let your IT team know that they have to add one more option for the driver to choose. Ask them wait there for 1 minute if it is 3rd time the package has not been delivered. Find a way to let the customer know when you are delivering the package. If they are not busy to press MISSED DELIEVERY button, they are not too busy press YOUR DELIVERY IS HERE option. Check your competitors, they are notifying customer about the delivery.

CONCLUSION: Even though representatives wanted to help, nothing has changed. This review was written with hope that something will change, even though I have seen a couple reviews like that at your review page. If you do not know how to do it - reach me out."

"I had such a negative experience with Purolator recently. I placed a purchase on a website that I've bought items on many times before. On this website, our address auto populates and I have always selected this one. We live in a new development and so we have 2 postal codes that work for our address. I got a notification Purolator was delivering. I then got a notification that my order could not be delivered because of an error with the address. I used the chat function on the purolator website and it said ""did you mean this address?"" with the other option for a postal code. I clicked yes, again it does not matter both postal codes work. I then get ANOTHER notification that the postal code doesn't work. I was frustrated at this point and just decided I will have the package delivered to a store close to our house for pickup. I then get an email saying it is there for pickup. I go and it's not there.

So frustrating. I will say however I have had to call Purolator twice for assistance or to get an update and I had two of the nicest workers answer the phone. They were very helpful and kind."

My package was ready for shipping last Friday. They are supposed to deliver from Scarborough to Richmond Hill (about 28-35 km or so). I have tracked the package and find out they never picked it up. ????? It is one week passed. Why Puralator was charging me full price for 3-5 business days delivery if I don’t get it on time? Puralator is sucks. Next time I’ll ask sellers to avoid to use their service.
"I had 2 packages getting delivered today and an hour ago it said that it was delivered, I am the only one here and nothing was received. I had instructions to leave it with the front desk and they said they left it with security? WE HAVE NO SECURITY! I called them and told them that I don't have the package and they just read what the tracking info said WHICH I ALREADY KNEW! Then they told me to call the shipper?!?!? How about you contact your driver to find out where it is?!?!

**Update: Since writing this, Purolator reached out and it took a week, but they found the package. Apparently, the driver was new and didn't bother to read the address and thank goodness the security still had my package. It was great that Purolator reached out and actually resolved the issue, I wish that customer service would've helped when I called originally. Thank you to the Tracing department!"
"Purolator should perish. I hate them so much. Every time I get a shipment from Purolater, it goes missing or they just put a delivery attempt notice slip on the door without calling me. I am home every time YOU GUYS ""attempt to"" DELIVER! BUT HOW COME I NEVER RECEIVE MY PACKAGE while I am home all day!!!!!!!!!!!! I am more frustrated today because I moved to a new apartment unit and was waiting for my new mattress from Amazon. I was home and didn't receive a call or knock on the door. The driver gave my package to some random guy named ""Phil Bestbay"". Is there anyone whose last name is Bestbay? Is he a fictional character to receive a package???? No signature. Just verbal confirmation?!!!?!?!?!?!??? Give me a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I contacted Purolator for the wrong delivery. They say I need to wait for 5 days cause today is Friday. This is disgusting. If any online retailer uses their service, I have no respect for you.

p.s. It arrived 5 days late than the expected delivery date. The package was left outside the lobby of my apartment building. My superintendent found it left to the public access(I live in downtown area).

I already purchased a mattress from a local store. And the customer service rep said she will give me an update as to the whereabouts of the shipment. She sent me the update a few hours after the package was delivered. If they advised me the update immediately, I could have notified them I already made a purchase of mattress and return back to the sender. I already explained my situation to Purolator and they just sent the package to me.
Now, I need to bring this mattress to UPS to return it to the sender. This weighs a lot and it will be a lot of trouble moving this to the drop-off location...
They really screwed me up. I wasted my time communicating with them and waiting for the mattress and my back hurts.
From now on, whenever I make a purchase from online retailer, I will ask them which delivery courier company they use. I will not buy anything if the company uses a delivery service from Purolator."

"Horrible customer service and delivery is useless, did not leave a notice of delivery. Supposed to be delivered in 5 days will have to wait ten days because I didn’t sit on my ass and wait all day."
"I wish I could simply request that Canada post of almost anyone else would deliver my orders from Amazon. Unfortunately this awful company ends up delivering most of my orders these days and I've had nothing but mixed service and frustration. Purolator will occasionally leave my packages at the door, which is fine. We live in a good neighbourhood and I'm not all that worried about packages disappearing, it hasn't happened yet and I always see the delivery update as soon as the package is delivered so I can go downstairs and grab the delivery. However they have now on multiple occasions decided to not leave the package and just drive away. I then contacted purolator the next day about my package and they had to ""reschedule"" either the delivery or pickup for another day and refused to let me drive to their sorting center and pickup my package myself even though I live only 29 minutes away. They admitted to me that the package was there, but would not allow me to pick it up? Makes absolutely 0 sense, and is probably one of the stupidest policies I've ever experienced. I'm completely fed up with purolator, they deserve every one of the bad reviews they have on here.

Update!

The package finally arrived today and the packaging for the guitar strings I ordered was ripped up and opened, and the box for my headphones had clearly also been opened. The best thing this company could do to respond to my review is stop existing, that's it. Bad service all around, I wish there were other options, unfortunately Amazon does not let you choose"

"I wish have a option to give this company NEGATIVE stars!


So I have a package to be delivered at my door yesterday.
It came right on time.

The deliver person knocked my door at 10:34 am, I was drinking my coffee and I had no shirt on it.

So I went to put a shirt and opened the door.
The deliver person had Vanished!
It was last than a minute.
I was like?? Ok!

Picked up the note and later on went to my local distributor (specified on the purolator note).

NOTHING!

It’s not the first time that happened.
It’s not the last.

So I called the puroLATE today, they gave me no information besides “we’re overloaded and your order might be delayed”

VVTF! That delivery person was rushing for?

This company is unprofessional.
They workers are unprofessional.

Now my components from Canada Computers are somewhere in the limbo.


So yeah! AVOID THIS DOG SH1TT company.

After receiving verbal assurance they would be there within 2 business (customs not an issue with docs), I paid $150 (which ironically gave me confidence that they must know be very good at their jobs to charge that for 6 documents). It is now day 7 and they are not delivered. The tracking comments of where the parcel has been and the excuses given fir delays says it all! (Dangerous good delay-paper cut?, covid protols- that wasn’t foreseeable!? Missed connections. It is better travelled in the US than I am !
Save your money, and mental anguish and go FedEx. Even when I contacted my lawyer in Barbados she said, “Don’t ever use Purolator! Always FedEx)
We’ll, as you may have guessed, no one feels motivated to give me a refund fir this spectacularly amateurish effort! (Wish I could give zero stars)"

Had at least dozens of bad experience from online retailers that is using Purolator Ground. Probably due to their bad logistics and tracking system. They notify me the package is on the way to my house and it takes at least 6+ hours before it reach my house.

Just flabbergasted about their non-service. Our son sent us 2 bottles of wine for our anniversary (we did not know) As we were not home they left note that we have to pick it up now (40 km away). If someone ordered something and it is sent to the house address just leave it at the door please. Utter bureaucracy!!!

I had an item shipped from B.C. to Kitchener it was suppose to arrive on or about Aug 19. It is Aug. 27 and still waiting. They informed be there was a delay due to the 401 being closed near Guelph. I checked. No road closure until the weekend of Aug 28. I don't like being mislead. Never use Purolator because it will come LATER!

This is the third time this summer that the delivery person was too lazy to deliver to my door. I live in an apartment and work from home. I buzz the driver up and they immediately send an email saying undeliverable/delivery attempt. The drivers are clearly too lazy to do their job. Had they asked me to come to the lobby I would have. But I end up having to reschedule a drop off or going to the main location. Worst delivery service by far.

"Purolator is the worst shipping company
I was supposed to have a package on Monday received an email stating that my address was incomplete sent them the correct address package still hasn’t arrived do to address being incomplete"
Well I got my shipment on time. I had to put in a bit of a effort but it got delivered on time. I think because of living in a apartment that's unsecure has caused all the complications in the past and now covid 19
"So my daughter arrived by plans and required a Covid-19 test from home half way through and Dynacare sent it by Purolator.
Somehow, the delivery guy thought it would be ok to have her pick it up from their location rather than delivering it to her address.
I guess he missed that she is in quarantine.
I had to leave work and drive for almost an hour to pick it up for her and deliver it myself.
I’m wondering if Dynacare pays them for this crapy service which they delegated to me by being lazy and unprofessional.
PS. Not the first time with such a bad experience with this company. Different circumstances same bad service.
I’m sure they don’t care."

"There is no time that my packages got delivered by purolator without getting lost!!!!! every single time the packages get delivered to the wrong address and customer service people don't give a damn when you call them, so rude, unprofessional, no compassion and not even interested to listen or respond to the questions.

"I order quite a few things online. Amazon delivery, Canada Post, UPS...all waaaay better than Purolator. My parcel literally sat in my city for days according to the tracking. It never did provide a delivery date. And then I sat on hold for over 30 minutes to have them tell me my package would be somewhere, sometime, but they couldn't tell me when. I will not order with anyone who uses Purolator. It was the slowest delivery ever. I will be contacting the company I ordered through to lodge my complaint about the delivery."

"I live in the basement, first he came before time and luckily i was outside my door, i asked him to wait for 5 mins but he rudely ignored. Then he told me to come at 1pm but when i asked their customer care for not showing up. They told me he came at 12pm. He didn't even called or anything. I told him to call and i requested to call me twice in the morning to the customer care also. But seemed like they also didn't also wanted to help me. I have been trying since last week for the pickup and it was urgent as hell but they don't care. I won't use this service provider ever again in my life."

"Would definitely give a negative star if the option was available. According to Wayfair product would be delivered on Aug 23, 2021, which is why I had ordered from Wayfair. Product recevied at Purolator local facility as of Aug 20, 2021. They will not deliver becuase they have not sorted the truck very lame. If you are too busy do not take more business and if you do take new business make sure it is delivered on time. This is why I never use Purolator as was prefer Fed ex and UPS as they are more reliable. Customer Service also not helpful rediculas. Won't deliver and wont let me pick up."
"No less than 3 times now, I've had delivery drivers not even attempt to deliver a package to my apartment complex claiming they didn't have an ""access code."" Every apartment has a call box in which I can buzz you in and GIVE you access, which they would know if they even showed up, but why would they when they can just claim they attempted delivery and not be reprimanded?

Canada Post, FedEx, Uber, and Amazon have figured out how the mysterious call box system works, so what's the story here Purolator? No attempted delivery notice is left at my door or anything, if I hadn't checked my shipment status online, I wouldn't know what was going on. I recommend Canada Post over this joke of a logistics company."

"Purolator has been very unreliable in the Sea to Sky corridor (British Columbia) there are no longer any drop off locations and the drivers rarely (if ever) leave a tag on the door indicating you have a package waiting. You have to track your packages independently and look for them amongst piles of other packages. I recently had Mortgage documents mailed to me via purolator overnight, and we are now 11 days post my signing date and I had to make other accommodations.

If you want happy clients please do not ship via purolator here."

"My package was ""out for delivery"" on Monday. Never arrived, so I called their 1-800 number on Tuesday and was told that the shipper required a signature? Told them I had been home all day. No delivery scheduled for Tuesday. ""Out for delivery"" again on Wednesday, no delivery. Called them Wednesday evening and was guaranteed delivery today, Thursday. Called them again Thursday evening and asked if they could put a hold on delivery as I would be in the city on Friday and would pick it up. No guarantee that it would be held, as it was scheduled for delivery Friday. When I asked for their local phone number to call, was told they don't have a local number. Asked how do you run a business without a phone? Was told their local number wasn't for customers??? Stated I was going to call Amazon and make them aware of Purolator's poor customer service, Agent said go ahead, no big deal. Called Amazon and requested they be removed from my list of carriers. This company is awful."

"I ordered a Chair from online and Purolator refused to deliver it because it was over 70 pounds, they said I would get called within 48 hours and they never called me.

Now I continue to wait for my package I paid shipping for while Purolator fu*ks around and leaves me waiting a long time.

The WORST company for shipping, and then you get a copy paste message from their ""Live Agents""
I wish the company I ordered from did NOT use this shet awful company for shipping."
"I have dealt with almost all the delivery services. Canada Post, UPS, FedEx and even DHL but Purolator is by far the worst. They have consistently let me down and now I know whenever I receive a delivery from Purolator I will have trouble receiving it. They have lost my packages on numerous occasions. They have made delivery attempts in the past and did not leave a delivery notice, and when I said can I pick it up in one of your locations they said no that's against our policy. If 0 stars was possible that's what I would give them because they are definitely below 1 star."

"Attempted delivery - if you received a Delivery Attempt Notice, follow instructions on the notice. There is NO notice. I have cameras that are motion and doorbell monitored and nobody even showed up. This is a house with a street address and nothing in the street nor driveway.

Worst delivery service ever!!...Either the drivers at Purolator doesn't know how to dial buzzer code or they are just plain dumb!!... They keep on stating various reasons like wrong delivery address or person not at home when I have been home all the times they had missed their deliveries. They have made only 1 successfully delivery till now and that too they just left package irresponsibly on a corner of the apartment lobby!!...The buzzer code was clearly printed on top of the package. They could have easily given me call!!. It was only because I was glued to my phone checking updates on the delivery I was able to know that they had delivered . But only after spending 15 minutes frantically searching the apartment for the package!!!

"I just had my bank offer to overnight some documents to me as they are time sensitive, I asked which courier they use and they replied Purolator.
Drawing from everyone of my previous experiences with Purolator.I said no thanks send them via snail mail Canada post and I will deal with the consequences of them being late, as late is better than never receiving them at all.
I read all these customer service responses ""were sorry you had this experience blah blah blah"". When there are over 4000 reviews and 95% are 1 star and that is only because most of us would like to give 0 stars but that is not an option, instead of trying to fix a systemic issue case by case. Why doesn't the management get their house in order, fire the deadwood and hire competent people, oh I know you are unionized and unions protect deadwood,well grow a back bone and fix these issues.
Your entire workforce it seems has zero interest in performing their jobs so file bankruptcy and restructure. Your company is a stain on the entire country's reputation!
Update I see I just got a pointless response from purolator, here is a tip folks if you shop with Amazon and sometimes get packages shipped via Pur and the service sucks as usual you can call Amazon and request that Purolator be de-listed from your account, It is far from bullet proof and might take a couple of tries but now if Amazon does use Pur with my orders I call them up and they refund the dollar amount back to me and reship via a competent courier leaving it up to the Courier Gods as to whether or not I ever see the package from Pur if by some miricle i do it means double the order for the original cost. At least I do not lose out cash i actually get what I ordered and if enough of us do it Amazon might get the point and DROP Purolator as a courier.
Purolator who's motto should be: Purolator,were the worst and most incompetent company on the planet!
Fun fact, when I am at home and the morons from Purolator are too lazy to ring my bell (which I can prove as it connects to my phone so would be logged) they just drop off the ""sorry we missed you BS note"" the note instructs me to go to their depot to pick up my package, the depot is located in ANOTHER city 3 bus rides and 1.5 hours each way! How is that for customer service?"

I got a SMS notification, saying that missed delivery, receiver unavailable. How in the world it happened while I was literally 3 meters from the door anxiously and consciously waiting for a knock on my apartment door for this delivery?

"Dear Folks:
Did you know Purolator reply to every single review is just a computer generated one. The best way our voice to be heard is we all must do what this person is suggested, the reason is most of the Purolator drivers have no brain and if they do is not bigger than a peanut and located in their Big Fat Sorry you now what.
Thank You

Many years old I chose to avoid using Purolator at all costs when they couldn't even deliver an ink cartridge to the house. Fast forward 15 years and my recent experience exactly mirrors the past, no delivery, no notice, no communication, impossible to reach customer service--likely because there isn't any. Unfortunately, I will also abandon the online companies that use their services as well and hope some of those companies think twice before using their inferior services."

"Ridiculous services, it’s been 5 days all they have been telling me that the package will be delivered by tomorrow but guess what the package is still not here. I am supposed to leave the town with that package and they are suggesting me now to pick up the package on Monday on my own. The solutions they give are awful, the label creation is at fault this time because they mentioned my mobile number as the street number, WOW how stupid is that. I have cleared the confusion zillion times in last 5 days but no update nothing. If people put trust in your company, please at-least try to be little considerate about their expectations.

"I want to cry everytime I see my package is being delivered by Purolator! I just hope they go bankrupt and get closed! Worst service everrrrr. I was supposed to receive a package two days ago but package returned to the sorting facility bacause the entrance delivery code was needed! Although my package had clear instructions on how to enter the building (the delivery person just needed to dial apartment number on our entrance door which is not complicated at all every other carriers can enter except for these guys!). I called them 6 times from yesterday they say it’s in sorting facility and I still cannot go and pick it up, because it hasn’t been scanned!!! Today it was out for delivery again even though the agents on the phone confirmed that she put a note saying not to deleiver because I wanted to go and pick it up, but guess what right now I just checked my package status returned because they couldn’t freaking enter the building again!!!!!"

"Worst company ever. They had to deliver 2 packages. They delivered 1 package at 2:57 and didn't deliver second one 2:58 because they did not have the apartment entry code. what a joke. It was same address and it was same guy who delivered. You came to deliver the first package in the apartment because that box had entry code, and you just took the second box back without leaving it together because there were no entry code?

"The worst postal service. I had a very expensive (around 1000$) parcel delivered at the wrong address. I called them, waited one hour on the line, they promised that the parcel would be redelivered the next day. I specifically asked if they could guarantee that it would would be delivered at my place the next day because I really needed it and they said yes. Next day, they delivered it at the postal office directly. Two days wasted waiting for a parcel that I'll have to take a cab to get because it's really heavy. They are unreliable and don't deserve a single penny."
"My experience with Purolator has been basically poor most of the times. Since Amazon continues to use them, along with CP (which is another bad courier service), I've decided to end my Amazon account. The 'online buying' experience has been very bad in the last 4-8 months, including the service from Purolator."

"Purolator is a company with the worst service ever met.

Never had any good experience with them and afraid to buy anything with this company as a logistics provider.

Tried to buy a TV from Bestbuy, found that they're using Purolator for delivery, changed to Amazon, as the delivery service from Amazon very good. Unfortunately, after getting information of logistics provider, surprisingly saw their name.

Every time, I scheduled a redelivery time, them came at a different time when I wasn't at home. This happened 3 times for the delivery of my TV. Can you imagine that?

Every time calling their customer service, it coat me about 40 minutes!

I will complain to Amazon and return this TV.

Seems that everybody is complaining this sh..ty company."

"The shipment was supposed to be delivered to my house, but they changed it to have me pick up and texted me about that. I was not able to pick up as the package is too big and heavy for me. I had to cancel the order.
Very bad service! Untrustworthy!"
"Purolator is reliably UNRELIABLE! Horrible service, if any. They are unreachable, regularly don't deliver and tell you they did, even though they were not seen on our RELIABLE security camera. I prepaid for service last time and they attempted to bill the shipper again! Purolator never picked up the item at all and billed my credit card. Purolator is a fraudulent company."

"I recently tried to get a parcel from Rapala a very reputable company.
The driver claimed he could not find my address and contacted the shipper although my phone number was given in case of further problems. The second time it was to be delivered I watched 3 Purolator trucks drive down highway 7 in front of my house and none even slowed down.
i made 4 calls and although the website stated weekend delivery it was made apparent from the supervisor on the 3rd call there would be no delivery until Monday. Monday there was also no delivery I googled my address and found it rather easily I also took two of my own pictures showing my address and the stubs from 3 other deliveries to my address from 3 other companies and 3 other delivery agencies. The reception was rude when I contacted them and found I will never purchase from anyone who uses Purolator and will post this to every one of my 1.7 million followers on my many media channels with a note stating please share."

My recent experience with Putolator was very frustrating as the package was time factor important. The parcel finally arrived took 6 business days or 9 days total when quoted 2 business days. As I'm tracking this parcel it's going everywhere but to my address that they couldn't find either..(what no GPS in your vans?)then resent to warehouse 3 hours away!..for a day or two more. I ended up picking it up myself at a warehouse closer to me.

"After waiting for our package all day, we went out for dinner and found a delivery notice with the note that the package will be ready for pick up two days later at their only depot in the city 38 km from our home. I called their 888 number to find out the time for pick up. The lady was nice but could not trace where the package. My efforts to trace the package was also unsuccessful. We went the Purolator depot and called the number posted in the parking lot. The lady who answered ( again was a nice lady) told us that the courier guy put the wrong date and the package was not there yet. When informed that we have come from other side of the city, she offered to have it re-delivered but only a couple of days later, or we could pick it up the next day. Since we will be out of town later, we are going back tomorrow hoping the package would be there. I plan to advise my future shippers not to use Purolater for my future shipments."

"Service is very bad. They have a contract with Switch Health for Purolator Express, but they decide when they can pick up a package. And if it has to wait 3 to 4 days that is just bad luck. No wonder no one wants to deal with them, and I wish Switch Health would have used a different carrier."

"Purolator pretends they tried to make a delivery attempt but won't even ring the buzzer. When you contact their customer support to know where the package is, they won't be able to help. They had to call a store to check with them if they actually had the package or not because the tracking history said Purolator had picked up the package. When asked why they didn't deliver the package, this is their response: ""It is possible, however, that he went to the wrong address or buzzed the wrong number."".

They ended up leaving my package in a store far away from my place. It's a 30min transit to get there. You loose 1hour of your time because they can't manage to call you or buzz you when they're in your area. If I wanted to get another delivery, it couldn't be done in at least 4 days.

Very unprofessional and they're not trying to find a good solution for you."
"Here we go again. A year later, exactly the same experience.
Somehow, they got the record of last year's debacle removed form this site.
I orrdered from Amazon (who I told last year NEVER to ship to me via Purolator) and, once again, it sits in Etobicoke for a week. No sign of movement.
My last experience, that extended to 3 weeks.
Then disappeared between there and the west coast.
I went through 3 tiers of damage control people without any kind of resolution.
In the meantime, I received several packages from amazon, shipped by different couriers ... and it was from one of those drivers that I discovered what the REAL problem was on this coast (they use COVID as an excuse).
I finally had to phone that depot and get loud with them to get my expensive item delivered, after nearly a month in transit!
We'll see how long this one takes. In the meantime, I've contacted Amazon again, telling them I'll not order anything else from them if they insist on shipping via this disorganized joke of a company."

"Crapiest and nastiest delivery carrier in the market.
I wonder how the hell they are in the business till now
I have never ever got my stuff on time if it was shipped by Purolator .There were times where I didn’t even get my stuff .Same thing happened this time ,I ordered couple of stuff through Amazon and I received each and everyone one of them except for one package that they decided to use Purolator. I was supposed to receive it by the 19th of July and today my order history showed the carrier is unable to deliver as it is on a nonexisting address. They didnt leave any slip which showed that they were even here or tried to deliver. I’m sick and tired of Purolator I hope you close down soon.

Shame on you for such a crappy service!"

"Should they even be in the delivery business? And should Amazon really be using them with such a poor rating? Ordered an item and the tracking started well but soon it had arrived at the same sort facility 3 times, and then ended back at the sort facility after it being on the van and a missed delivery by the driver with someone else's package. Seems like the driver just gave up and went home, even though deliveries are suppose to occur until 9pm. Was rescheduled for delivery for the following day which then turned into 4 days. Customer service staff unable to help, not knowing where the item was located. I am sure Purolator are fully aware of their abysmal service."

"Absolutely terrible. Ive called multiple times to update information. Then it says it out for delivery and I wait. Then get emails that say delivery was attempted, and I couldn’t be reached. Ive been home! This is the second time they’ve attempted delivery. I still have not received my package because they have to update information again. Customer service representatives are very nice on the phone, and Im wondering where the disconnect is with information being passed. Is it delivery drivers? Don't use purolator.
Update: I now have to go pick it up. If you expect them to deliver on time and efficiently, it will not happen. Staff is so nice, I cant understand what happens between customer service and delivery."

"I am not happy with the service I received from Purolator courier guy and customer service, they seem to only do the bare minimum and are unreasonable with their expectations on you yet they do not go out of their way to service you!!! Apparently two attempts can be literally done at the same time or within minutes and if for whatever reason you miss them, like they are known not even to knock on your door. So then you have to wait for 24 hrs and go pick it up yourself, kinda defeats the purpose of having something expressed, if you have to wait lol!!!"

"This is by far the worst delivery company in my region. Each and every time one of my packages is delivered through purolator, the delivery person doesn't even come out of the vehicle to ring my doorbell. They just mark it as ""Attempted delivery"". I'M HOME ALL DAY LONG AND NO ONE NEVER RINGS. It's funny how Intelcom, Canada Post, UPS and even freking Fedex(sometimes) are able to ring without problem. This morning I had 2 packages out for delivery, one from intelcom and one from Puro. I received the package from intelcom without any problem but half an hour later, I get an email saying purolator attempted delivery. I always need to contact customer service and tell them to send my package to a point of service near my house (which defeats the purpose of, you know, dellivery) but today was the worst because they sent it to a facility in ANOTHER TOWN for pickup.
So yeah, I'm more than pissed with them and it looks like nothings gonna change soon."

"The worst service so far. I've been subscribed to a food delivery service since 3 years ago. In my previous address I lived in a townhouse and never had any issues. About 5 months ago I moved to a condo, and I started having problems with the deliveries. I work from home, but the courier person always claims I'm not there. Every other order is the same problem, a few times my food has been spoiled because the order is taken to a purolator office where there's no fridge. So I need to take a bus to get it (which defeats the purpose of the whole delivery service); or wait until the next day until they can try to deliver it again. All orders from other delivery companies arrived with no issues, I guess Puralator personnel doesn't like to take elevators to deliver the orders, or we are too insignificant to get the complete service."

"Absolute trash service. Being lied to by the customer service team constantly is the best.
Keep saying a delivery attempt was made to my location, however as the receiving person I spoke to the two Purolator drivers that showed up... not a single one knew about my package and actually called the depot looking for it.
However when I call in customer services tells me that they will attempt to deliver it tomorrow. I am sick of the lies and the run around. My last interaction with Purolator resulted in them taking 2 weeks to deliver an item over night.
I would rather pay more money for delivery if it meant that the company didn't lie through their crooked teeth when I have an issue.

Edit: gotta love when a company reaches out but doesn't care to actually address the problem. Your employees lie right to my face constantly, why would I assume your customer service team will do any different. Will you get my packages where they need to go on time? No you won't."

I'm putting one star because it's the lowest they will allow you to post. THEY NEVER RING OR KNOCK EVER EVER. I swear they prepare all their slips in the truck as they drive and just stick em on doors. I wish I could NEVER use them but companies don't tell you they will use Puroshitter.

"Logistics for a delivery company are not easy, I know. However other companies like DHL, FEDEX, UPS seem to be able to provide service that is somewhat reliable. I never had a purolator delivery on time, never. With 95% of bad reviews (at the time this was posted) it shows how much purolator actually cares for their service. When I call their agents you hear the frustration in their voices, so not only clients are unhappy but employees are unhappy. I won't bother detailing my issue here because I will get the same copy/paste response as the previous reviews. If you came here to check if you should use purolator for your next shipment, save your self from the frustration: don't, its not worth it."

"I am a frontline worker who took a day off just to receive a big package. I was waiting for the package to arrive the whole day. I went to the washroom for a MINUTE to find out that they came during this time, knocked on the door and left. I can see the delivery car from the window. They don't call or text upon arrival at the house. They don't provide an expected time slot for delivery and even the date of delivery is not correct. When I called to inquire, they provided no alternative valuable solutions other than me taking another day off and wait for them to show up at any time during that day! This company used behind time method of delivery that doesn't meet the needs of today's customers. We live in a pandemic that requires creative solutions for home delivery. It is unfortunate to say that Purolator doesn't care about customers satisfaction. Also, it's unfortunate that companies such as #bestbuy is dealing with such company!"

"Absolutely unprofessional, if receiver is not available they should have called or just merely take the package back to a hub where there’s still a chance to receive order. This is for all shipper or delivery person, put yourself on a situation where your order (s) goes to waste due to it has not been properly process, won’t you feel disrespect due to your order has handed or address as worthless package? Delivery people must have gone through SOP so why not practice and be professional. One last question, what if the package is very important as matter of life or death? Of what if the package is as important as the last penny you’ve disposed?

"Absolute garbage of a delivery service. Unreliable in EVERY WAY, with customer service giving no help, or solutions.
A tracking system that doesn’t alert customers that there’s a problem until the day of delivery, then sends package back to the processing warehouse extending the delivery date, with no notice of a new delivery date.
I cannot stress this enough, choose ANY OTHER delivery service.
Purolator is the worst."

I have had many bad experiences with this company. When they are in my building just leave the note to pickup my stuff in their place instead of call me to let them get in my building. Always is the same bad service when I buy things in Amazon.

"Most unpleasant service I ever received in my entire life. I do not really like to give bad review to any business, but this has crossed all the limits of my patience. I had 5-6 deliveries in row for last two months. None of them were delivered to me successfully in timely manner. For the very first delivery I waited for 1 month and had no update, no emails, no calls, no texts. Since all these deliveries are for my legal documents I almost felt depressed thinking what would have happened to my documents. also the matter was time sensitive. For the other deliveries I start keeping track and still they did not delivered it saying that there is no buzzer code to enter in building. for last three months there is a maintenance work going on in our building and hence they have written the buzzer code with big big letters at the entrance of the building. I don't understand how come you cant see that buzzer code. The last one I had was the only successful delivery and that too because I literally seated on my door waiting entire day and communicated to support team constantly. I still have one more package to deliver and I will again have to seat on my door for entire day waiting for the shipment. I literally spent $45 for each delivery and on top of that I had to take day off every time just to wait for delivery. If I am spending this much amount at least I expect to get any form of notifications for the status of the delivery, did not received any single notification even though I subscribed my email for the notifications. Good thing to mention here is their customer support is awesome."

"Purolator is the worst delivery service i have ever witnessed. Ordered something on best buy on friday which was estimated to arrive on tuesday. I received no text when I subscribed to the receive text when arrival. I did not even know deliveries are dropped off on a sunday which they left a note saying I was unavailable when I was literally cutting my grass in the backyard. The same day I call purolator for a redelivery they said it will come in the next business day which is monday. On monday they have it so it gets ready for delivery. On wednesday I call them again and said it did not come so the agent said it will arrive the next morning which didnt come. For a week they don't deliver my package due to ""high volume"". Mind you I live literally 10 minutes away from the sorting facility. So I called on friday to see if they deliver on weekends, and they say they don't. They literally ""attempted"" delivery on a sunday which is the weekend. So after 1 week of complete incompetence, i decide to cancel redelivery because i believed the package would not arrive the next week either. I expected i could pick up on saturday but no they dont work on weekends all of a sudden and they have no idea when it will be ready for pick up, same as the redelivery. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
WORST SERVICE IN THE WORLD DO NOT EVER USE PUROLATOR FOR ANYONE WHO GETS THEM."

"WOSRST DELIVERY SERVICE IN THE WORLD.
I've had problems with purolator before on not wanting to ring doorbells and sneaking away after sticking on a sticker. Literally what is wrong with your drivers. I was home ALL DAY two days ago with my front door OPEN and the driver snuck away after not bothering to ring the doorbell. Obviously someone is home if the front door is f ing open. AND I requested for a redelivery for today I waited home all day and since clealy its not coming I asked to chat to a representative. She told me she cant tell me when the package will arrive even though it was scheduled for a redelivery today. Truly the worst company to exist. On top of that the item i bought is from a store right next to their location so whats the point of choosing the option for it to get DELIVERED if Im going to have to pick it up there anyways. I wish i could give them -5 stars."

"Worst one I have. I did the Covid -19 test on Thursday (as of July 15) and scheduled a pick on Friday from 1 - 5pm (there is no time slot available on Friday morning.)
Based on the description of an agent, a driver came to my apartment at around 4:00 pm but did not find the parcel though I left detailed instructions. Even worse, since the driver came very late, they would not schedule a new pick. An agent told me that tomorrow (Saturday) they will ship the parcels picked today (as of Friday) but not arrange new pick ups. They did not care whether the test will be still valid after the weekend and not want to make up for their mistakes. Additionally, if I did not call them, I even had no idea about what had happened to the pick up. So try your best to avoid them."
"Hello Perry, I am very sorry that the driver was not able to locate your package for pickup.

They came by my house and left a note telling me i wasn’t there (i was there all day and my dog did not bark so they did not knock). Had to call and wait 1 hour on the phone to re send my package. The lady was really rood on the phone and was not at all helpful. If I could give 0 stars I would but that option is not available.

"I live in a town with a local depot that receives deliveries from the main branch twice a day. I had a package delivered with them (not by choice) twice in a row where i used my PO box instead of my home address because most delivery places won't come to my rural address, please not purolator does not either. I've been diligent about tracking my parcels and I attempted to change the address before it arrived this time but was told that was impossible by there 'help' agents. Twice now on a failed delivery instead of taking the package to a local depot to wait for pick-up they've taken it back to a city more then an hour away and despite me getting the destination reset asap the package cannot arrive at any reasonable time. it took two extra days for them to resolve it last time and now it's moving onto 4 extra days despite having fixed the error within 5 hours of getting the alert. 4 Days to deliver to a depot that gets deliveries TWICE A DAY!.

"I own a small business and count on the promise ""It's not just a package it's a promise"". Nothing could be further from the truth. My business depends on quick turnaround times. Recently two of my deliveries were lost. They can never find them. I tried the Chat to assist, but they disconnected due to no agents available. Then I called, waited 59 minutes to reach someone. After that it took another 30 minutes for them to tell me they don't know where the package is but will look for it and call me back within 2 hours, which DID NOT HAPPEN. They do nothing except wait for your package to show up. I DO NOT WANT APOLOGIES. I want you to do your job properly. That was Monday. Today, I received a package, on time, yeah, however, the package, (which was a single DVD) looked like they ran it over and then backed up, shredded the plastic packaging and then stomped on it. Needless to say the DVD was in pieces for something that needs to be done right away. Got in touch with the CHAT line, they told me to fill out a form. What a load of crap. You already made my life more complicated and now I have to fill out a form and then what? It is not like they are able to replace what is on the DVD. I asked to speak to a manager and I was promised a phone call back within 2 hours. Well believe it or not no phone call back. And oh, now they are closed until tomorrow. And the tracking number is 333030257476 - so don't send a response and say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, send me the tracking number and we will look into it."" Apology not accepted. Actually do something other than apologize. You actually still charge me for this crappy service. You should change your slogan to be ""It is a package that may or may not be delivered. We do not guarantee any timeline and your package may or may not be in pieces when you receive it"" then at least it would be the truth. And don't expect customer service as there is none. Ever since people started working from home the wait times are crazy. I think people put you on hold while they do their laundry, watch TV, take the dog for a walk, vacuum, eat lunch, anything but doing their jobs. I can't wait for a response, if any."

"First time dealing with purloator... They cannot figure out how to deliver a package to my appartment building. They claim they cannot find any way to do so. It's a pretty standard intercom at-the-door appartment building. They never contacted me through the intercom or even the building manager. They then called me at my personal number, telling me they have failed to deliver twice and telling me it's fault. I then try to explain its an intercom and on BOTH occasions the delivery driver did not use the intercom, but the person on the phone was just as incompetent. In the next episode, we'll find out if it will take them all week to figure this out."

"If I could give negative stars I would. I never pick this company, I only ever deal with them when it is outside my control. I have even chosen to not shop from some retailers because they use purolator. I have been waiting for equipment from my job for over a week and it kept being delayed. They would email me saying that it missed the truck or it missed the switch. And when they finally had it out for delivery they never showed up and later sent an email saying it was inaccessible. I can see the front door of my building from my window. No one came, no one even drove by. How they figured it was inaccessible is beyond me. After waiting 45 minutes to talk to an actual person I was informed that, even though they are owned by canada post, they could not and would not drop my package at a post office. Or even the closest pick up location. No they would drop it off at the one across the city from me, and couldn't confirm if I would be able to pick it up as soon as they opened. Just that I would have to wait a day and track it on their site to see when in the day I would be able to go and pick it up.
If I didn't need this for my job i would write it off. Rude unhelpful customer service agents who apparently cannot give a straight answer or be helpful in the slightest. And the drivers don't bother to even attempt a delivery. Do not recommend. Chose anyone else."

"Not the first to make a posting about a driver that doesn't bother to even come to the door, yet claims they made an attempt to deliver. I was literally 2 meters away from the door ALL MORNING. It was a Friday, nice sunny day, Driver is thinking, why bother even bothering to deliver , they get paid either way, hit a button, say you tried to deliver LOL and get off early to enjoy the sunshine. NO notice on the door(management never bothers to check , they are a joke) Drivers run purolator apparently, management similarly is sleeping the day away on regular basis, from so many of this EXACT same complaint being posted all over Yelp, here and probably many other places. It would not be hard to track this, IF management cared. The call center would just have to ask if a notice was left, drivers could be flagged. But you know it's sooo much easier to just sleep the day away at the office.

I waste my time calling to get delivery ""re-attempted"" LOL they never attempted EVER to date.. So she scheduled it for the next day they can, wait again around all morning. NOTHING!!!!!!!! Said it was ""On vehicle for delivery"" ends up being dropped off for ""Shipment available for pickup' NO ATTEMPTED DELIVERY!!!!! So great for the drivers, you can just slack off pile up a bunch of packages that you don't feel like delivering, then you get to just dump them off at the depot. AHHHHH yes another easy day in the life of a purolator driver. It's not like they have to actually prove they posted a notice of a delivery attempt on doors, management never checks. So much sunshine, maybe take a nap parked for awhile, maybe leave work early ahhh so relaxing. Packages, what packages LOL

Update
Their response was a non-response. All she did was the very same check on shipping, I had already done on the internet, and gave no more detail than the website as to why the driver lied about making a ""delivery attempt"". I guess it looks better, that they responded to sound concerned, rather than a genuine concern to fix the problem."

"Purolator is by far the worst service I have experienced. They are a 0 out of 5 stars but I had to give them a 1 to write the review.
To come to Canada to care for my family, I received permission from the Canadian Red Cross. Even though I was approved to enter Canada, I still needed to complete the federal guidelines and isolate 14 days. On day 8 I completed my second covid test on line with switch health (a federally contracted agency). I called purolator for a pick up of the test (per the guidelines and the contract they had with switch health). Pick up was scheduled and was picked up the next morning. It was an express package and was to be delivered to the lab the same day. It is 4 days later and it has not been delivered. And the test is no longer valid. I am now experiencing extended isolation because of their incompetence. Useless. Absolutely useless.
DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE."

"Like others have said I wish I could give them zero stars. Out of the probably 10+ orders I have placed this year, I don't think a single one has actually ever made its way to my front door. I have been home and available, waiting for most of these orders, and have never ever heard my door knocked, rung and they never leave a door knocker. It's always ""Oh! you missed the delivery and they couldn't leave a door knocker so go find out where your package ended up!"" Most of the time it has not been a big deal but as of lately this absolute joke of a company is now costing me and my business money. I'm out of a job now because they fail to even come to my door. Complete waste of time. Stay away from this greasy slimeball company."

"Wish I could give 0 stars but I can't. What is there to say: always late, always the same bullsh*t excuses. I'm not sure how they're still in business. Why offer fast shipping to people (both companies and residents) if you guys can't follow through with it. It's always the same BS excuse that has been used for YEARS. Why not fix the issue at hand. Why are we paying extra for fast shipping if you guys cannot simply follow through! Ordering things to be delivered on a certain week only to be told it'll come the following - rendering the item useless ! If you're a company, small business, or just a regular person try and find a different place to ship from if you can because it's not worth the waste of money nor the headache. You would think they would prioritize shipping packages that are marked as EXPRESS/FAST shipping. Until they fix this problem they will always be a trash delivery service. I wasted my time and money. Didn't even get in touch with someone on the phone (was on hold for 50+ minutes) had to resort to contacting one of their social media pages only to be told the fast 2 day shipping I paid extra for turned into 5 days. Delivery was not even ATTEMPTED. Took the day off and stayed by the window only for the truck to not even pass by at all."

"Purolator you did it again...
A few years ago I had stopped ordering anything from any company that uses Purolator because I only had trouble in the past with this clown of a company (at least clowns are funny sometimes...) Purolator is the equivalent of the notorious killer clown, they get to your package kill it and bury it in their warehouse to never be found. June 29, 2021, to be fair, the first error did not come from Purolator, it was a shipping or administrative mishap from Amazon. At first, I called Purolator who informed me that the sender had not processed the pickup form required; good, no problem, hung up with them and proceed to call Amazon, we set replacement, and finally, I knew that I had to wait at least two additional days. But they guaranteed that the package would be at my place by yesterday June 8. It a chance that I work from home because whether go with the deficient bot chat, email notification or tracking system, you never ever get the right information. On the 7th it said that the estimated delivery time was on the 7th, then I realized after they finally updated that garbage of a website which they want us to rely on, the package was not on route to delivery, it was sitting at their Circus (warehouse).

So the next day, I decided to call to find out when should I expect the package, which I was told because it's a heavy package it required special handling and this would create up to 4 days delay. You know, Purolator, one of the things that would make you a better company would be to ""actually"" provide detailed information on your website, your email notifications or anything so we, the client, won't spend all day waiting for something that will not be delivered. I am a business client from FEDEX and guess what; if they can't deliver on the promised day, I'll be notified by email with full details or I can go on their tracking system and get full details almost instantly. Yours, it will just display your estimated delivery time is such and such date, but nothing else. Now I know, that when I'll check your website again today it will say, estimated delivery for today, and tonight at 9 pm nobody would have shown up.

I am not going to ask how you're still in business, because it's obvious, you are still in business because your shareholders keep on making money, as long as they keep making money you still can treat your customers like yesterday's diner. But there is one thing I will ask Amazon and it's to never ever use Purolator to deliver anything to me even if it was just a bag of sand, you'd manage to tell us it needs special handling and that I'll get it in three weeks, yet your tracking system will keep on telling me that it will arrive today, day after day for two weeks.

There is a reason I was anxious when Amazon told me that Purolator was the delivery company, I said to myself ""OMG, here we go again..."" You really are in the wrong business, you should become a circus, but before you change your venue take an example from other business models that succeed. For example Le Cirque du Soleil.. they DELIVER... You don't!"

"Just the worst. There no other way to describe Purolator but THE WORST. They tried to deliver to my building one day but couldn’t get in. Did not try and connect with me even tho they had my number and information. So with out a notice they just left and didn’t leave my package. (Witch is a computer monitor I need for work, currently working on a broken monitor at the time) then I call customer service and tell them they can just leave it in the lobby when they come again tomorrow. When tomorrow comes I get a notice that they tried delivering it this morning at 7:30... before I was even awake. Again no call or notice they are here. On top of that they don’t follow the instructions to leave it in the lobby but they say delivery was unsuccessful so I now have to drive 30 mins to a pick up location to pick it up.... I live in a city core and have no car. Beyond frustrated with Purolator. Wish I could have them blocked from being the ones to deliver packages to me"

"In August 2020, my dear brother passed away in Calgary. The Father Lacombe Society, a long term residence where he resided sent me a box of his things via Purolator. I literally waited weeks with no delivery or notification. Nothing.Finally I was informed the box was returned to Calgary after sitting in Toronto a week. I was billed about $75.00 for nothing. They never once contacted me, didn't phone, never emailed, never rang my buzzer. What a bunch of con men and a truly slimy organization. Thanks for absolutely nothing.

Unfortunately, my last 3 shipments over the course of 6 weeks were all late or disappeared in thin air. Customer service has no clue and trackers won't return timely responses if any. Stay clear if you can. They are not even worth 1 star"

"I'm a small business trying to recover from this past pandemic. One of my largest orders helping us to get back on our feet was completely destroyed by this shipping company. The amount of disregard and eventual damage to our items was completely inexcusable and hard to believe. This company has zero customer service, I spent over an hour trying to file a claim just to get hung up on.
Use anybody else, Purolator is the worst in my experience."

"I had 2 packages coming though purolator of which none of them have made it to my apartment.
My apartment has a buzzing system which needs a particular code for particular residents. I ordered both packages though amazon and didn't see any place to add Delivery Instructions.
To my dismay the packages were given to purolator who didnt even try to call or look up our code and left the package to a local delivery facility. While the 1st package is sitting in a facility;We tried adding Delivery instructions to the 2nd package that was in transit. The agent then told us that delivery instructions cannot be added to this package as she is unable to ping the driver. So you have no clue where and who is handling your package? Seriously!
To make matters worse I am under Govt mandated Quarantine and cant wait in the lobby for it. So My package now will go to a local facility and rot there until I can go and pick it up!
What is the use of all this tech when you have to pick up your own packages the old way!"

"Myself and pretty much anyone else that I've asked ( family and friends) all say the same thing when asked "" what do you think about Purolator?"" .. well, they suck! This company's customer service is garbage, the drivers have delivered my packages to houses that aren't even in the same city, leaving me s.o.l., you wait around all day for your package that may or may not arrive when you're told "" it's on the truck for delivery today"". I HATE that they don't leave your packages at the door if you don't answer. We waited around all day for our package only to be sent an email at around dinnertime stating they attempted delivery. Really? Did you knock on the door with a feather? We have two dogs that don't miss a damn thing! We called customer service and were told that we now have to wait roughly two more days! This company is ridiculous and I have no idea how they stay in business. We are experiencing a record breaking heat wave and our two air conditioners and two fans aren't enough. We were waiting for another fan to hopefully help with air circulation.. I am 9 months pregnant in this heat ffs. Big surprise that Purolator doesn't care and moves onto the next delivery that will probably also end in someone else's ""attempted delivery"" They are literally the most unreliable delivery company."
"They tossed my package around and they promised to deliver my package to my apartment but it was never delivered. They blamed me for them not delivering my package. Overall, very rude and unprofessional, very bad experience, 0/10 recommendation."

"I have a package that hasn't moved for a week. I've contacted them repeatedly and received no assistance; I even offered to go and pick it up myself and was told no. Apparently it is too difficult to deliver or even scan.

Calling in for customer service is infuriating, I waited almost 45 minutes last time I called them, just to talk to a person; of course they were no help at all. I asked why my estimated delivery date of June 29th was changed to ""not available"" on June 30th. They told me that I was supposed to add 4 days to the estimated delivery date because the package was heavy and that the sending party should have told me that. What??? It's Purolator's own tracking website page that gave me that date, why can't they provide an accurate date on their own page?

I asked for a trace to prove that they actually knew where my package was and was told they would call me back. I followed up the next day to see why they didn't call. I was told they were allowed 24 hours to return my call. It's now 4 days later and I still haven't heard back from them.

This package is in my city, it just hasn't been loaded on to a truck for over a week now. I have asked for help getting this package on more than one occasion and have received nothing but talk. This is a real problem for me because it contains a part for my vehicle and I cannot drive without it. This has not only inconvenienced me, but effectively cancelled my long weekend. Thanks Purolator! Your service is terrible, but at least you're consistent.

If you have to get something important delivered, DO NOT SEND IT WITH PUROLATOR!. It may be important to you, but it definitely isn't important to them and you're not important to them either."

They postponed my pacel 4 days later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They are the worst!!! I called amazon to find out, amazon called purolator and the reason is the DRIVER WENT TO A WRONG ADDRESS SO THE DRIVER DIDN'T DELIVER MY MATTRESS!!!!! HORRIBLE!!! ......Thanks for your reply. It's alright. Amazon already removed Purolator from my account for my future order."

"The most terrible post agency I have ever worked with! I have been waiting for a package for almost three months now! Initially they couldn’t find a giant building in the Vancouver city centre to deliver my package and no one even gave me a call, so the package was sent back! I had to call the sender and they kindly accepted to resend. Purolator employees managed to miss the big building in the city centre again and since I knew they wouldn’t call, I followed up myself and asked them to send the package to a store close to my apartment. They sent the package to another city this time!!!! When I called them and asked them about it, they said that they will send it to the correct store in the next week. Two weeks later, when I followed up again, they said the package is still in the wrong store in the other city and I can go pick it up! Terrible business, terrible post agency!!"

"I paid a fortune to send a package with 2 day shipping to a place in northern ontario. They took my money and assured me that it would get there. It even said delivery date was within 2 days on the tracking info. When I realized it was still sitting in Toronto i called. They tried to blame covid. Surely they should have worked that out by now.
If they could not deliver in 2 days which is what I paid for they should not offer it. Its pathetic."

"This company is a joke. I was on hold for 4 hours!!! Finally got through and the guys like “oh I’ve not been busy today it’s been nice” probably because you just leave people on hold hoping they’ll hang up so you don’t have to deal with them. Rearranged my parcel to be delivered the day after I missed it, all confirm then I get a call at 3pm “we’re not going to be able to deliver today”. I was then told the parcels weren’t big and I’d be able to carry them.. turned out that was not the case. I hope I never have the displeasure of using this company’s services ever again."

"An honest slogan for the company would be ""We provide the worst customer service on earth"", I've have the infortune of receiving my last 3 packages with them and in all occasions they have been a delay with my package due to an address error, apparently their system doesn't get your unit number automatically, and when the driver makes its first ""attempt"" to deliver your package that won't be possible because there is no Apt. number.... they won't call you or send you an email, you have to call them and wait at least an 1 on trying to reaching a customer service representative just to confirm that you won't be able to get your package that day even if you offer them to go to the sort facility and pick it up there...

After this, if they deliver your package next day, you will be a very lucky person, since I have to wait at least 3 business days since the customer service representative failed again to include your apt number....

For real if I could select my courier on amazon when I placed the order I would never use Purolator, and I rather to pay for a fly ticket than sending a package with them, this is just the worst customer service ever, I have to wait nearly a week for receiving my item even though the item is already here from the beginning of the week"

"My package has been sitting at the sort facility for almost 5 days now, with no movement. Purolator is consistently the worst. I've been waiting for over half an hour to try to speak with someone. I wish I could give less than 1 star

EDIT: I contacted Purolator multiple times to try to get assistance. If I thought it would do any good, I'd take them up on the offer. The question we should ask here is why do they have to have a social media presence running damage control for their poor service? Should we believe that their social media team actually have a greater ability to assist us than their customer service line? If so, it speaks volumes about how much Purolator values customer service. Thanks, but you guys had your chance to help me on more than one occasion; if you think I'm wasting any more of my time on you, you're mistaken."

"I wish there was an option to leave no stars. I received an email on June 7th my package was shipped. I had not received it and had not received a call to indicate an issue. Upon tracking my package I could see that in June 9th it was on the delivery truck and had a “ delayed in transit due to disruption”. The same day the msg read “Appointment required for delivery, receiver will be contacted to reschedule”….. not one single person contacted me. I called them on June 16, when I saw all these comments in the tracking. On June 17 the message read “ Shipment available for pickup. Receiver contacted.” Which I find annoying as that reads like they contacted me. I scheduled a new delivery date. Well that date came and went still no package. On June 22, I called and rebooked again! On June 23 they decided to ship my package back. I called customer service again today, the woman on the phone was rude. We have watched purolator drivers come in to our driveway which is long as we live in a rural area, standing on the porch and the reverse out. I will Not be using this “delivery” service for any reason, to be honest if that is who a company uses I will likely not make the purchase. Save yourself the hassle, find a better option."

Delivery guy didnt even knock the door and just left a note in the mail box. I was sitting down in the living room and they never knocked.

"I have made 7 or 8 calls to Purolator regarding my package. Manager from Purolator promised me delivery next day and told will call me to confirm. There was no call and no delivery attempted. They never send you an email/ message if package moved to different location for pickup. I end up travelling from one location to another 1 hour away. I called purolator in between call dropped and representative initiated redelivery without my consent and I am 1 hour away in another location . They have long wait time as well. They don’t know how to manage ,if there is an address change. The delivery driver who came didn’t even knock the door/ring the bell while I was waiting in the living room. They don’t even know how important documents are. Delivery drivers don’t have cellphones, we have to wait whole day. Things has to change. You should bring more proper method of delivery including send a text message when you are about to arrive something like that. You have given more stress in past days to me. I have requested for a callback to raise a complaint and who knows they are gonna call."

A huge thank you for getting my package to me. Somehow I missed his delivery this morning and he came back this afternoon and delivered it. I called customer service and the lady helping me was awesome and said it be delivered the next day is urgent I don’t know what she did but she got it to me.This delivery came out of Calgary and was delivered to Carstairs. Again I cannot thank you enough.
just not a good experience

"I have had my packages go through this service a few times, the first time I didn't get many notifications due to an address error and as a result one got sent back. The second one I managed to get fixed in time.
My third experience has been so much worse though, I keep getting 'address needs to be fixed' notifications over and over, and I have called multiple times to get this issue fixed. Three times now I have called to have no result, the virtual assistant won't recognize my address and whenever I try to chat with an operator it tells me there are no agents at any time of day. If my package gets returned AGAIN I am blacklisting this delivery service on anything I use and refusing to order from anywhere that uses Purolator."

"Amazon has chosen to send some of their packages through Purolator, and every time they have, it's been horrible.
The delivery driver never rang the bell or knocked , but leaves a note that no one was home, which was a lie. The last time it happened, we even heard the delivery driver walk up to the door, -throw- the package (a TV) to the ground in front of the door, and left without even pressing the doorbell or knocking.

We've contacted Amazon to put them on a blacklist for delivery to our address, and we've never had a single problem with another courier. Later we were contacted by an Amazon representative, and they asked if we'd like to forward our issue to higher management. I really hope they cancel Purolator's contract.

Edit: as expected, a canned response. You do realize that every single time you paste a prefabricated response like that, it hurts your reputation and image more, right? It shows you do not care at all, and are aware of the problems, but refuse to fix them."

"Delivery was scheduled for a certain day. The courier came three days earlier with absolutely no notice carrying an expensive item. They just threw it somewhere in the mailroom and left without taking any proof that they delivered it. No picture, no signature. Nothing. The item was of course stolen immediately from some of the nice neighbors here in the condo. When we called customer service they said its not their responsibility. Its like they want the item to go missing so the shippers may pay for a signature service or something.. For all we know the courier themselves just took it with them home.. Terrible service with absolute zero ownership and sense of customer service."

I emailed Purolator to advise that I don’t want to have to pick up this heavy box. I was advised that as soon as I get the message stating it is due for delivery that day to call them ; they would advise the driver to call for directions. Guess what..... I have been waiting on hold for 30 minutes so far! I will be absolutely shocked if the box reaches my home.
Stay tuned Purolator!
Well still on ‘hold’ 40 minutes later. Checked the tracking and my heavy box has an unable to deliver notice 🤬"

"Avoid this company at all costs if you do not want to have a heart attack ! Here is my experience :
1. Purolator came to my house and did not ring or even knock on the door. I work from home and haven't heard a thing.
2. It's like they intentionally avoided me.
3. They left a delivery notice to pick up the package at a specific location - Michaels store 30 minutes from my house.
4. I go to the store to pick up the package. The guy at the store (not a Purolator employee) , searched my package for 10 minutes and couldn't find anything.
5. He informed me that this happens quite often that people arrive in the store and their package is not dropped off there.
6. He advises me to call the 1-800 number which I did. After being onhold for 30 minutes , finally someone answers me and we try to locate my package , they tell me someone has attempted a new delivery again today which is another blatant lie.
7. I tell him the delivery guys are not telling the truth and emphasize the terrible service from Purolator and he starts to scream.
8. I ask him why he is screaming and demand to escalate with his superior .
9. I make a complaint with Purolator.
10. I don't always have my package and I don't know where / when to pick it up.
This is the worst , most horrible customer service experience in my life"

"That should be a minus star. I read on the Purolator site that packages are delivered between 8am and 9pm so, I waited for 13 hours. I got an e-mail this evening saying my parcel was on the truck for delivery. Only, it never arrived. Little wonder Purolator has so many negative reviews, I am shocked that the company still has any customers at all. I have been waiting for a package from Shaw, another company with a LOT of very unhappy customers, figures Shaw uses Purolator, they are cut from the same pathetic cloth.

I have spoken with the company 3 times on the phone and twice over the internet in the past 2 weeks to confirm the address (which was right all along, the sender gave them the correct information) and they still insist they do not have the right address. I've gotten the sender involved and they've opened an investigation, but yet again, my tracking number says they do not have an address and delivery is on hold. Literally 3 times this week I have confirmed the address. And two times the week before online. Every single time thy say 'yes, we have it now in full. Your delivery will be there tomorrow'. And yet again, I got another notification today saying they do not have the address. I am so angry. I just hung up after being on hold for an HOUR and no one even answered. I will never again accept a delivery from them. If anyone tries to use them to delivery to me, I will either cancel my order or just refuse it at the door. I'm done with this bulls*hit company."

Worst company ever....and customer service is terrible.... gave my shipment to a 3rd party and have no idea where it is..... Gastone employee #71043 was rude and offered absolutely no help but to say Oh well.
Everytime something comes from Purolator its always a headache. I was home all day waiting for the terrible delivery to show up. What did I get? A sticker saying we missed you. How can you miss someone whose sitting on a couch beside the door they never knocked on?. Should be a requirement to have common sense to work at Purolator because everytime they come to my house its complete morons. I wish they would go out of business I really do. Shameful they're still a company. People take days off work just to deal with this crap.

"Would give 0 stars if i could. unbelievable that Canadians are paying for this Honorable company to exist!! whats the point of a delivery service that dose not deliver ?? dose not even contact me? had to drive 120km to pic up my parcel. they claim they tried to deliver but multiple people were home all day. call Websters cause the definition for attempted delivery is ""just drove by without looking"". this is not the first time . this company should be bankrupt but and run outta the country. literally cant say enough bad things as this miss-managed,poor customer service and snarky attitudes are shocking. Anyone that has a positive experience must be a employee getting paid to say that or happen to live right next door to the pic up point. any manager working for Purolator should smash the nearest window and jump to their death..."

Still waiting for my package which per order page where suppose to be delivered yesterday. Chatted with Purolator online and no apology for delay only a sad explanation that it just got delayed. I understand that’s a heavy weight item but no matter what get shipped with this company there is always an issue and the customer service is bad! They just don’t care! Avoid if you can.

"Ordered a laptop and it was on truck for delivery in my small town one morning. 7 days later they cannot find it. EVERY piece of electronics that I have ordered online and been ship by Purolator in the last two years has been ""lost"". Not shady at all. Never use them if you can avoid it."
"Can't tell you how many times they've had a failed delivery attempt because they didn't read my address well enough to see the buzzer code. When this happens with literally any other shipping company, they take it to a pickup point that's within walking distance from my house. With Purolator, they literally take it a 1hr bus ride away....most of the time, I could've done in-store pick up and it would've been easier. HORRIBLE customer service too. If the companies I order from told me they use Purolator, I'd never order."

They were holding it 7 days with a note incomplete address! No notice no call, how the hell was I suppose to know that!!! Absolute crap company, had problems before with them"

"It's simple, purolator is the worst courier service in Canada. I drop ship through the distribution channel and my disty's use multiple couriers and purolator is the worst. There's only one disty I have no choice to ship my client's orders through puro. All other disty's I specify to use Fedex or UPS.

They constantly lose packages and claim the were delivered. Pain in the rear to get credit for lost/damaged packages. Happens with purolator more often than any other courier. Totally unacceptable.

Purolator: Shape up or ship out."

I wish i could put à negative 100. You get an email saying at 8am your package is going To be delivered its in the truck. 6pm NO PACKAGE. WHAT A WASTE OF A DAY. WORST SERVICE EBER. Called company who use Puralatir and recommended they use another company. The service sucks and they seemed do think its ok to send out emails saying its in the truck and NOT SHOW UP. PURALATOR YOU SUCK AND I WILL NOT EVER USE OR RECOMMEND YOUR COMPANY.
"Only because this does not go below zero. I shipped 2. 60 pound boxes. Very well packaged with bubble wrap and foam. After arriving to the destination, some damage to the boxes and contents inside. The recipient was home to accept the packages. They claimed no damage reported during and arrival in transit. They claimed i did not use signature option which they know full well that that is not an option during Covid. Them they claim it would be a verbal agreement for acceptance. Then why would I also pay for signature option. Took extra money for insurance. Filed a claim for the damaged items. Claimed they don't know what happens when the parcels are left. They wee damaged when you brought them. Looking to file a news story to expose this money grab scheme if there's."
"Worst service ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the drivers are to dumb to read an adress properly ! they never delivered on time !!!! If amazon continue to use them ... im gonna cancel amazon premium and never gonna buy something there again ......to reply of your automatic stupid reply ...Its not one bad expérience with you purolator , its like 50 times and more ,i wish you gonna lose your contract with amazon ..."

Way better experince then averyoone! I bought 4 things from NewEgg (ships with purolaator) and had aan exxellenmt experience evrytime. Good condition and fast shipiing
"I used DHL and UPS before and I didn't run into so many problems. My apartment does not have a working buzz code so I tried to put my phone number with the tracking number so the driver can reach me. Instead, Purolator says their drivers don't call. What if something happens? DHL calls, Amazon delivery calls? I talked to three agents online already. The first told me they will reschedule and request the package to be placed in the apartment front doors. Then, driver attempted next day and left again. I chatted with another agent who told me I need to waive my signature. When I asked how to do so, they said you can't do that online.... Other major companies like DHL allow you to waive your signature online so why can't you do that? The pickup point is one hour away by bus, and now I gotta wait until next week for it to be delivered to a new address cuz apparently mine just never works...."
"Don’t open the small business account in Purolator. You never know how much you need to pay until the bill comes up.

When I go to the Purolator store, their staff weight my parcel is 1.5lb, their app estimated is $59, but end up they charge my parcel at 3.5lb for $67.66.

When I call their customer service, they said their warehouse weight the parcel is 3.5lb, they don’t need to provide it, they can charge you what ever they want.

Wow, I’m afraid next time they’ll charge my 1lb parcel for 10lb price.

Last time, they also charge my parcel around $15 for correct address. I call them I didn’t request any corrections. They said their computer shows it is. No arguing.

You never know how much is the unknown charge until you’ve a bill. You can’t find any service fee on their website too.
Their bill only shows how much you need to pay， no any details, such as the size of the box or weight. Moreover, even you’ve the recording, they’ll tell that your measurements is wrong.

I’m too frustrated with their service, I prefer FedEx, at least I know the exactly shipping fee, no unknown service charge."
"Ok, this is just for me the nail on the coffin.

I order a package that ends up being a bit heavy. They delay it one week and put the parcel on hold. I contact them and tell me the depot will arrange the delivery with me.

Two days after that, I call them again to see what happens. Now they directly deliver the parcel on a day that is super inconvenient for me instead of arranging the delivery.

Just simply don't use this company, sad that Amazon uses it as one of its main delivery services in Canada, they should 100% ditch them until they fix their problems."
"I scheduled a pick up for today between 10 AM to 2 PM. It’s now 3 PM and no one has yet shown up. I had to reschedule my appointments to make myself available for 4 hours for pick up and they don’t have common courtesy to update me if they are late or if they are even coming today.

I called purolator just before 2 PM and after waiting 20 mins I got to talk to someone. The lady was so rude and said it will be picked up before 2. And here I am still waiting. I called after 2 PM again and I was asked if I would come drop it off. After paying $25 and waiting for 5 hours I am asked to drop it myself.

Ridiculous service!"
This is not a delivery company. You have to actually deliver the package and they never do. I am home but they say I am not. I end up having to go pick it up somewhere. Wish Amazon would quit using them!
"From all my experiences, all over the world. THIS IS THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE ANYWHERE, EVER. Its a shame that its a default for many companies to use for delivery, But man, avoid them if u can. I have nothing but bad experiences with them. They find ways to mess up the simplest of the things. And their delivery people seem to be looking for reasons to not deliver.
If I could, I would avoid them at all cost, Pay a bit more and use someone professional. What a trash can of a company."
"They don't provide good services even after charging higher amount then other provider . Customer support is also not good , they advertised express deliver as same day/one day for me its already 15 days and package is not yet delivered"
"I received a notification on May 31, 2021 that my parcel was picked up from my pharmacy. On June 1st. I recieved another message that my parcel will be delivered on this day. On my account I stated that when the courier arrive to use my buzzer # which is also on the delivery label to let them in the building. Instead the courier left a note on my door that he missed me. I WAS HOME all this time waiting for my parcel. The driver didn't bother the use the buzzer which is also connected to my phone or call.
This is my 3rd.time that I had problem with the delivery because some couriers don't follow simple instructions. I am Very dissapointed with the service and I hope Purolator rectify these issues immediately."
Literally the biggest joke of a company ever. How is it 2021 and you can’t figure out how deliver packages? The only thing your business claims to do… I will go out of my way to not order from companies that use you
"THEY N.E.V.E.R DELIVER ANY PACKAGE EVER

During pandemic, I did have several package delivered at my place (apartment building), and Puro is the worst. They always find an excuse to not deliver my package. When I contact customer service, they blame it on me...

I think they shouldn't offer the service to personal/residential address if they doesn't want to do the job properly. It would save the customer and their team some work..."
"I would rate zero if it would let me
The worst courier I’ve ever dealt with
They say they made an attempt to deliver and they didn’t because they don’t want to drive out to my place
They are getting paid for it
They lied and said they attempted delivery never left a door tag or rang the doorbell I was home all day
Then eventually leave it at a drop off for me to pick it up
What a joke. They are the most unreliable service ever
Even the drop off place says they lie all the time
Never again will I have them as a delivery service. Use anyone else"

"Package from Calgary to Vancouver gets sent to Nanaimo (on the island) first? Seems a bit out of the way, no? And then the usual “Delayed in transit due to routing issue.” In other words, “We’re sending your package all over the place because we don’t know what we’re doing.” I wouldn’t bother writing this if it didn’t happen almost EVERY TIME with Purolator and Canada Post. Totally mismanaged companies (same company). I recommend never buying anything online before verifying who the courier will be. If it’s Purolator or Canada Post, tell the seller you’ll only buy it if they use another courier—unless you’re ok with waiting a month to receive your package."

"Would give zero stars if I could.
Chose purolator for important package basically because as bad as purolator is Canada post is even more useless, purolator has better tracking,
And every purolator driver in my town knows me. Doesn’t help when they contract it out to a different company though. Tracking changed from out for delivery to incorrect address. No delivery attempt made, confirmed by camera, virtual assistant completely useless, just said address doesn’t exist.
(Keep in mind I receive probably 100 purolator packages per year at this address). Was on hold for an hr, eventually gave up, online chat was also useless just gave me the option to retry delivery, just replays the same scenario again, or hold for pickup like 3 days later, After perishable package is ruined. Don’t put your company name on a product if you’re just going to contract it out to morons"

Their online chat never works, call centre agents are not helpful at all and so rude after being on hold for over 2 hours, and after all that, the only thing you get is the pathetic delivery attempt notice when there's absolutely no attempts made.

"Horrible delivery attempt by Purolator. I live in a condo and I was home all day (of course because we are in Covid lockdown) and my package was supposed to arrive yesterday , as i got the notification. I never received the package. When I check tracking that evening it said 'Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible' . Did they even attempt deliver? Usually I would get a call when they enter a buzzcode to let deliveries in, not this time. There are constantly Purolator trucks here making deliveries. I called support, and of course had to wait over 30 mins on the phone to talk to someone, and they can't even find where my package is, finally they think it's going to arrive in possibly the next few days. Now i have to wait 4 more days to get my delivery. The shipping depot is like 5 mins away with (no public access) This is a ridiculous courier company."

"I purchased a hot tub from Wayfair. I need it for therapy, with my arthritis and rehab. Wayfair shipped it from KENTUCKY, in a days time, with FED EX, when it got to Canada, Purolator took over.
It has been sitting at the depot 20 minutes from my home for 3 days now. When I tried to do online chat to discover the holdup, the bot that sends pre recorded messages put me over to live chat, and I was immediately disconnected, as it stated there were no agents available. So. I call. On hold for 53 minutes. To be told the parcel is too heavy, so we deliver it up to 4 days after anticipated delivery date. WHAT?????? Have you no dolly? Is this the first 100 pound box you ve ever delivered? Seriously. I demanded answers. I was told the depot would contact me. Surprise! No contact. Comical part is, they drove my hot tub right by my house, so it could sit in a depot for days while I am in pain and in need. That's okay I guess Purolator, you re more important than I. What a joke of a company. I've also informed Wayfair of your lack of customer service in Canada. I'm sure I'm not the first, nor will I be the last. You stink.

UPDATE: Please see the generic reply copy and pasted below. My delivery dates are now pending on Wayfair and Purolator. No idea when it's going to show up.
Who wants to bet I get a sticker on my door after I've asked to go and pick it up (and was refused) so I can go and pick it up?
To date, no call from the depot either
Purolator, never again."

"I wish I could give something below 1 star. I have never had a single good experience with Purolator delivery and I have to pick up the package for more than 90% of the time because the driver's didn't bother to ring the buzzer code or call me when they were there.

Furthermore, my recent experience was even worse when I had to speak with a supervisor who won't let me speak and keep cutting me off. To make it worse, I was expecting the delivery by an express service 5 days ago and I'm still waiting for the package to arrive.

This is highly irresponsible behavior from Purolator not to train or instruct their employees well enough with their responsibilities and give some sort of resolution when a customer reaches out with some issue. My issue hasn't been resolved yet and I'm still unaware when I'll get my package.

Very disappointed!"

I wish I could have given them this in place of any stars 💩. Absolutely terrible service!!! I have never dealt with a company so against trying to come up with a solution to their earful service. I was on the phone for over two hours and not one of the 5 people I talked to gave me any idea of how we could rectify the situation! I will never use them again and if I ever come across a company that uses them I will not order from them. It was that bad.

I don't even want to give them 1 star. Apparently they are saying my delivery address is wrong and they have 2 failed delivery attempts. Why would I provide them the wrong address? Neither they receive a call and nor they give us a call back. I am still waiting to know what the hell is going on.

"I'm totally disappointed with Purolator service and will never recommend anyone to use your service. I had a package delivered by Purolator and that hasn't reached me yet. Last Friday(21st May), the shipment came to my place, but returned due to a missing entry code. I confirmed the address right away by calling a customer service agent(after waiting 30 min). He assured me the package will arrive Tuesday(25th May). It didn't arrive, rather online tracking updated as missing Apt/Unit number(HOW FUNNY!!). I was pissed off and chose the pickup option with the help of your chat bot. Later I realised it's not safe to go outside in the COVID situation. Then again I called the customer service to ask for an update. Now after waiting 35 minutes, she said the driver missed the apt number. I again confirmed my address, entry code and everything and told her to change it from pick up to delivery to my place. She updated and confirmed with me of the change. Today morning(26th May) I saw the address incorrect notification again in the online tracking. I called the customer service again and waited for more than 1 hour to get hold. She told me that there is an incorrect address and the package is going to the pick-up point. I laughed at that kind of pathetic service as none of my previous updates worked. I wonder if they don't encourage a second attempt to the same address. It would be nice for the customers if they had mentioned beforehand that they don't pay a visit to an address twice. Or they could have updated the online tracker to pick up once the 1st attempt missed. Anyways, seeing a lot of negative reviews, I'm pretty sure you don't care about the customer complaints and hence my complaint would go in vain. But as I wasted my money paying for their service, I don't want anyone else to waste their time and money after Purolator. They are just PATHETIC, PATHETIC, PATHETIC!!!!!"

"I am starting up a home based business. My partner and I ordered a shipment from New Market. it was a sizeable order requiring 3 deliveries from Purolator. We received the first 2 deliveries with no problem on My 14th. The 3rd one is missing however. When we called Purolator they had told us to call the company we ordered from. I believe this is what they call passing the ""buck"".
When I spoke to Customer service last night (may25th) after 40mins on hold. Janet (Purolator rep) told me she could see that there is confirmation by GPS that the package was dropped off on my porch. When I had ask for confirmation that it was the same GPS coordinates as the first 2 deliveries . Janet changed her tune and just kept confirming my address and not the GPS. She kept telling me i show your address as.... I then asked her to escalate the issue to someone else. She claimed that she would make a ticket for the driver to get back to me.
This morning i received the call not from a driver but from another Customer rep named Sal who was very rude and said he will be closing the case as it showed by GPS my packages have arrived. I requested that the case remain open and have his Supervisor call me back. He insisted that they could email me back. Normally this wouldn't an issue but due to the amount my partner and i have spent on these items. I wanted to speak to a Supervisor.
Sal was still being rude and during this time speaking over me. (Some crappy customer service).
When I was relying the information over to my partner. Sal hung up.
So I am calling back.
Now as I my typing this I have been listing to their hold music for the last hour.
Purolator if these are the type of people you have manning your inbound calls and claiming to be Customer Service. There needs to be some retraining done."

"Purolator is a horrible delivery service, I have had only negative experiences with them. They don’t even bother to deliver the packages anymore, they just bring them to a pickup centre and then text me to go get my own packages. Ridiculous as EVERY other company delivers to my address no problem. Purolator drivers are simply ignorant lazy people I guess. I try to avoid purolator every chance I get but unfortunately a couple businesses I order from use purolator. Don’t think I’ll be ordering from them anymore. Not worth the hassle of dealing with purolator."

"Purolator service is so bad, Amazon.ca has in my settings to not deliver via Purolator or I will cancel that order. They too are on my S**T list bc they sent a very important, time sensitive order, using Purolator.
Purolator used to deliver right to my rural address. ALWAYS had trouble finding us even tho they would drive by every weekday. THEN, they dropped off my stuff 7 miles away, which was inconvenient. That place burned...there are other places tho. NOW they drop off a town away which is 1 Hr. 20 Min. round trip drive. There's the hassle of getting there, standing in line, all of that. Which means that not only is this totally unreasonable and horrible service, we have to include the time in that town just to get the package, which is a minimum 2 hour miserable experience. We are pissed. Service pretty much everywhere has become real crappy. They blame covid for everything and I have made calls to 'businesses' and in every case, the employees have been laughing and joking - and nobody can 'help' due to covid. This is pure BS and a problem which will be with us for years. I will never use Purolator again, unless desperate - in which case I will do without. BTW, their automated 'chat' specialist is too stupid for words. Never understands even the simplest question. I tried calling but after the automated response said THEY COULD NOT TAKE MY CALL - Purolator disconnected at their end.
Maybe it's time to support local businesses instead of online shopping bc most online shopping, in my experience, has seriously dropped in quality.
Because of Covid,...it's always Covid now."

"I just called and cancelled my purchase all because of purolator and its inability to uphold its only responsibility of delivering a couriered package on time. no tracking info other than some pandemic excuse, a collective 3 hours trying to get through to customer support, and the 'delivery' is far past the 'promised' delivery date. I will NEVER use purolator again, and if a company is going to send me something through them, I will find someone else. to be sure, this is the ONLY courier that can't seem to deliver packages, on time, or to the correct address. I hope you go out of business.

Dont bother replying purolator, although I know you will, your copy pasted reply is empty. when you DO reply, it will just go to further prove that you are not paying attention.

EDIT AND UPDATE
After this mornings confusion with the phone customer service agent who was quite nice, somehow magically the website had updated and showed my package was both picked up and out for delivery. Any buyers excitement that I had started to return, BUT...

They attempted delivery to the wrong address. They left a sticker (surprise surprise) that says they were there and I now have to drive 40km away to pick up my package, tomorrow. furthermore, my neighbour was home and did not hear a door knock or doorbell, just saw some guy creeping in her yard before racing away. I heard the truck pull up for no less than 20 seconds and as I made my way outside I was just in time to see the truck literally speeding away like the house was on fire.

I HATE this company. with a passion."

"I will never use this service again, and I hope whoever reads this, and the other negative reviews, takes it to heart. Like many, if I could give negative stars, I would. Even 1 star is too generous for this soulless courier.

I do a lot of courier/shipping. I have confidence that most couriers will get the packages to their destinations on time, if not before. When I am curious, I can log in to my account and see exactly where the package is. None of that sounds unreasonable, especially in todays technological world.

Don't expect any of this with Purolator. Their 'tracking' is inaccurate, and does not update properly with scans. Often, the tracker will return a result of ""In Transit"" with no attached estimated delivery time even whilst it is out for delivery, only to be updated at the end of the day to ""Attempted Delivery"" or (currently) ATTENTION.

Now, late into the pandemic, things are even worse. Packages often do not arrive, and IF they do, it is well past the expected (and paid for) delivery date. Their website and tracker is completely useless, with every package now inevitably stopped at a sorting facility likely very close to you, but hanging in limbo with an affixed tracking update of ""delayed due to the pandemic.""

I am now convinced the customer service agents are using the exact website you are to track your package, as they have no answers at all, ever. This might seem like a lofty claim, and I hope you never put it to the test, but the agent will read you word for word what you are already seeing on the website. pressing for more, they robotically and presumably read from a script a series of dead responses, with the highest escalation being an investigation, the details of which, an ambiguous thing the customer service agent can't even outline. The headache from using this company is by far the worst.

Like many in the comments here, I have now called amazon and asked to delist purolator, and have decided to take a moral stand against them, and will no longer use their service, or accept any packages from them. If future clients/companies/distributors insist on using purolator, I will find different vendors. Plain and simple. This company should be shut down, and long ago.

I am not a big review guy, and have had consistently horrible experiences with other companies before, and I have never written a review like this, ever. But this company is so frustrating and poor that I feel the need to waste more of my time hopefully saving whoever reads this from using them.

Dont copy/paste your bs response Purolator, all it does is show how empty and truly uncaring your company really is. instead, quit your jobs, find something better for yourselves, because I wish, hope and pray purolator goes bankrupt and crumbles forever away before this year is done.

For shame, Purolator."

"***UPDATE: so their tracing specialist got back to me after a week or so and told me that they cannot locate where my parcel is and considered the case closed. How can you lose a product that was 100 lbs and bulky?!!! This is scary, if you could lose a parcel that big what more the smaller ones and important documents? So frustrated and disappointed!

Ordered a product from amazon and was sent thru this courier. It arrived in their facility in Toronto and from there they seemed to lost my parcel. Had i known the seller will use purolator i would have not purchased the item at all! They are notorious and does not seem to care about the company's reliability! No credibility at all!"

"Truly the worst experience. If I could give negative stars I would. I paid 45$ for express overnight shipping from North Bay to Toronto (3 hours). It was suppose to arrive Thursday, it is now Saturday and my item has has 2 ""failed"" delivery attempts and is now sitting at the depot saying it cannot be delivered. This is a cheque for a company, and both days they tried delivering it after 7pm?? what office is open at 7pm??? Not to mention, I paid for the fast shipping AND I spoke with customer service multiple times who assured me they talked to the delivery people and it would arrive yesterday. Over all, this has been the worst experience I have ever had with a shipping company. Do not offer express shipping if you only intend on taking people's money and then not shipping the item in a timely manner. This cheque NEEDED to be there by yesterday and Purolator has screwed me over more than they realize! Do nooooooootttttt use this shipping company!!! I know I never will again"

"Wish there was a minus rating for this useless company. Phoned 10:30 am to arrange a pickup for 2 covid-19 test kits to be delivered to Switchhealth who told us to put test kits in refrigerator to avoid contaminating the test samples if left outside. Purolator told us they will pickup between 10:30 am and 18:00 pm but to leave kits at front door or they won't pick up. By 18:00 no Purolator showed so phoned (initial recording said we were past the pickup time), got through to a live person and was told there's no record of a pickup request even though they were able to pull up the profile that was created in the morning. Asked when they'd pickup the kits and was told the next day between 10 and 6. So now test kits would have been outside for 2 days and most likely end up being contaminated. Won't be relying on Purolator anymore."

"First off, the purolator delivery guy dropped off a package that belonged to someone else. I found them through fb and they picked it up. Secondly, same guy sent a txt at 4:30 am saying I was unavailable when he tried to deliver my parcel. Nobody delivers at that time. After talking with the manager, I was assured it would be delivered by Friday, then it changed to Monday or Tuesday. THEN I receive a voicemail mail stating they don't deliver to my area and to come pick it up. Umm what?! Suddenly this is a thing. They are terrible and have had nothing but wrong, late and no show deliveries. I will never order from Amazon again or any place that uses Purolator. The branch in Terrace BC is a joke and needs total revamping. Too many problems because of laziness and ignorance. They have one job to do and they can't even do it. Way too incompetent."

Purolator picked up my parcel from downtown Vancouver. And lost it less than 5hrs later. 4 days later and not one reply back from the investigation. Oh by the way anyone will wait more than 45 minutes on the phone.

"Two deliveries. Two issues.
First issue, the ONLY company to put 'address incorrect' on a delivery out of all the couriers I've gotten including but not limited to UPS, Canada Post, Amazon, Pigeon, etc.

Second issue, requested a pick up instead of delivery after driver didn't leave the package at door. It's been 10 days since then, three online chats and zero calls from a manager to get my package to their pick up location. Oh the package has since travelled two other cities outside my region too. It also seems their chat bot is pretty useless when you have an issue with your package. Funny thing, my package is doing more travelling than myself during these lockdowns."

CANADA ONTARIO- FIRST TIME I GET PACKAGE DELIVERED AT FRONT DOOR AND NOT TO MY PO BOX. MY PACKAGE WITH A 70$ HOME SECURITY CAMERA WENT MISSING.

ITS BEEN OVER A WEEK AND THEY WONT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL AMAZON FOR A REDUND N THEY WONT PROVIDE ONE EVEN THOUGH THEIR DRIVER DROPPED IT SOMEWHERE RANDOM. THEYRE NOT GONNA HELP THROUGH EMAIL DONT EVEN BOTHER. THEY WONT REFUND LOST PACKAGES WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. THIS FEELS ILLEGAL.

I tried to get something delivered to me. The first attempt at delivery was not tried cause the appartement number was unavailable cause it is VR03. I called to confirm the address and told the lady on the phone that they need to call my number so I can open the doors. Two days later the second delivery attempt was made and the driver didn't made a single attempt at calling me and left me a paper at the door. Worst delivery compagnie. I will never want anything delivered by Purolator in my life.

I have to think everyone at Purolator. We forgot to put the intercom number on with the shipment. I contacted someone this morning and they said that they will make sure one way or another they will get this package to us. And they did they went the extra mile to make sure it was delivered. It was an item that has to do with my father’s funeral. They were so accommodating well wishing and sympathetic.
"I ordered an item on Amazon.ca. Purolator was the chosen delivery service. Unfortunately the driver simply stuck a sticker on my door saying he was there and that I can pick up the item at a drop service store. The driver's hand writing was so bad, I could not decipher the Package ID#, nor was the dates correct on the ""We're sorry we missed you"" notice. He wrote down yesterday's date with a pickup day the next day, which is today. It took me 2 hours to sort out where is my package, what the package ID# is, having it re-delivered to me tomorrow, and waiting on the phone for a customer service. All this for a $9.00 item??? All other Amazon deliveries have been dropped at my door, but nooooo, not Purolator, need a signature, not to mention a knock at the door. I was literally 10 feet away from the door this morning when the delivery was made. I only noticed the sticker on the door when I let the dog out! Not happy with Purolator, there are much better services out there. Use them. Purolator is not recommended as you can see that they consistently receive a score of 1 in their reviews."

"This is the worse delivery company in North America. They do not fulfill their duties, do not attempt to deliver to the person's address, but rather always deliver it to a facility in the area, saying they attempted the delivery when that is not the case. They are not accountable for not delivering their packages. I was on a conference call with Amazon and Purolator and Purolator refused several times to transfer the call to their supervisor upon request and raised their voice to me. They provided conflicting information, which the Amazon representative corrected. My delivery was late (actually I have not received it yet). They said they attempted the delivery but they did not, and they did not leave a paper slip either which confirms it. We are under a stay at home order in my city and asking me to go pick it up at a facility is asking me to break COVID-19 public health measures, that state that non-essential activities are prohibited. I urge all businesses to please stop using Purolator as your shipping company."

"This has to be one of the most impressively awful Purolator incidents I have ever encountered and it goes beyond anything I have ever experienced before. I had ordered a mouse from a store that is about 4 kilometers from where I live, low and behold Purolator was chosen as my delivery service. Normally I would immediately cancel the package but by the time I had caught it they had already somehow shipped it. I thought to myself “Huh, maybe Purolator is finally making a turn-around, doing things like same-day shipping!” No dear reader, they did not make a turn-around. What ensued has been and still is an 8 DAY CHASE SCENE for one single package. So prepare yourself as this is a story that you’ll want to hear.
Act I, “Missed Delivery”
On the Monday the package was SUPPOSED to come in (as Purolator does not operate on the weekend and I ordered it on a Saturday) I had a bad feeling, there were no updates on the package tracker website for quite some time and there had already SOMEHOW been a missed connection. I rechecked my address and stuff like that just to make sure that there were no excuses that they could pull such as “not a valid address” or “unable to make a delivery” etc. All the sudden after hours of waiting an update sprung up that the package was in transit, overwhelmed with joy I awaited the delivery persons arrival by diligently staring at my computer screen for hours, searching for the slightest update, but the update never came, in fact nothing came neither the update nor the package. Instead, what I did for the rest of the night was wonder, wonder how beautifully incompetent someone has to be in order to miss a 6 foot tall board with the names of all of the tenants and contact numbers along with the keypad which is used to type the numbers and call them. I know! I’ll just restate what the customer service representative told me when I confronted them with the same question. “Our Agents don’t carry phones”
Act II, “The Pickup Debacle”
“Here we go” I said to myself as on the Tuesday I read that I had somehow managed to input an invalid address and thus the legendary phrase was uttered “Address Correction Required” thinking quickly and clearly I decided that a pickup would be the best use of both my time and Purolator's time so I had logically decided that a location CLOSEST to me which is listed as a pick up point on their website and was recommended by their amazingly incompetent robot was best. After waiting one day, on Wednesday, I had hopped on the bus and rode over to the pick-up point which, mind you, was about 15 kilometres from my home, but all of that is just details. Upon arriving there I had realized something intriguing, there was no Purolator office nor sign. I went into the closest shop and asked a nice lady where they think the Purolator pick-up point was and they had pointed me in the direction of a small corner store right beside them. Determined, I marched onwards and upon entering my soul had dropped out of my body. Not only was the corner store small, but there was no designated area for pick-ups, instead, upon asking the clerk they told me that this was, in fact, a drop off point.
Act III “The Bungle”
Promptly after I got denied by the store clerk I decided to call Purolator customer support and had sat in queue to reach a representative for over 25 minutes, I had given up so I signed up for their callback service and started on my trip back home. Not an entire 25 seconds after I had registered for callback, my phone started blowing up. On the phone a chipper representative whose mood quickly turned sour when I told him the address called me stupid in not so many words and had quickly let me know that he had submitted a hold request at a facility nearly twice the distance from the pickup point and nearly 10 times the distance from the store I had ordered from but again, that's just a small detail. And this story is only just beginning.
Act IV “Missed Delivery, AGAIN????”
Goddamn it Purolator, just when my trust issues started to go away with you guys you offer the same heartbreak as usual. Upon reaching home I knew I could relax as Purolator representatives were cautiously caressing my package and making sure it gets to the facility with the fastest, most efficient and safe way possible. Once I woke up from that daydream what I actually did when I got home was stress out because if Purolator tossed my package around and it broke I may as well have to deal with their service again. Over 24 hours from the time the hold request was made for my order some braniac over at their offices thought that Re-Delivery was what I wanted after 2 failed prior attempts. Suffice to say it didn’t go over too well. To leave off on some note, neither good nor bad my package is still in transit to their facility none of the representatives know where it is or when it’ll get there but oh well."

Worst delivery service ever!!!!!! I hope amazon would stop using their service at all!!! It's not only taking toooooo long but also can't rely on their cs and website updates on delivery information. It doesn't even deserve 1 star! If there's zero star that would be it! I called purolator cs but no help.. I called amazon regarding my order only to be informed that it got lost with purolator handling the delivery. Perhaps it has been taken by some untrusted agent and reported it got lost. How could it get lost if they picked it up and in the truck. Maybe that's why they don't update the status on the website. Fortunately amazon has replaced it!

"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Every time I get something delivered with Purolator, it is a disaster. They tried to deliver a package during the day, I was not home, there was never any attempt made to contact me before hand to let me know my delivery was coming that day. The day of delivery, I got a very rude call from an operator out of the blue, demanding I come to the door and sign for my package. I told her I wasn't there, and she hung up on me. No slip was left at the door, and no delivery reattempt was made until 4 weeks later, when a slip mysteriously showed up at my door -- this time, I actually was home, however the delivery person did not knock, ring the bell, or call me. I literally will not order something if I see that it is delivered by purolator."

"If i could give zero stars I would. I have never received a package on time from puralator nor had it delivered to the door. I ordered really important vitamins as my cat is very ill and going through treatment. Vitamins are supposed to be started right away to boost the immunity while fighting this awful virus. Paid 25 dollars to have it delivered “overnight”. The package was prepared and send to Toronto FROM CALGARY. Puralator managed to damage my package in Vaughan, like 30 minutes away from my house and now has no estimated delivery date. They don't know how damaged the package is and I was told they would investigate and get back to me on when/ if I can pick it up. They haven’t and I have no idea if I should just cancel and get my money back and try ordering again. Im so disappointed the one time I actually desperately need something to come in on time and pay for quick service, I get stuck with puralator. As SOON as I saw they were the delivery service I knew there would be an issue. I don’t understand how this company is still up and running and cant wait till they are now longer in business."

"I ordered from Roots for a package to be delivered to my home. May 4th I get a notification that my package is out for delivery. It never arrived. May 5th I get a notification my package is out for delivery. I have 3 kids in online school right now, so we are at home. I get an email saying I was not home for delivery. I see a slip on my front door that was left 10 minutes ago. Obviously the delivery person did not bother to knock. Then I’m told to pick up my package in a town 40 minutes away. They send an email saying that my package is delivered. No Purolator, my package was to be delivered to my home. I did not request a pick up. Now they say they will do another delivery. I’m stuck watching my front door because no one at this company understands how to deliver a package or knock on a door. FedEx, UPS, Canada Post, couriers have all successfully delivered to my home. Asking someone to pick up a delivery that was meant to be deliver to my home is a FAILURE to do your job. All other reviews give the same experience across Canada. So this is clearly an issue Purolator knows about and does not care to address."

"For Purolator to advertise themselves as a Courier company is Fraudulent, as a courier service they are inept, incompetent incapable and every other adjective. The counter staff are generally rude, incapable of transcribing an address or telephone number and then surly when you ask for it to be corrected. The Nanaimo office particularly so. I vve had two dealings with this office, firstly they tried to deliver an empty box (camera had been removed) and secondly the delivery address and recipients telephone number were incorrect. Try to contact them for a tracking update, no one will speak to you, write an email and they we will get back to you in 48 hours. By which time the package is being returned ""At Your Expense"""

"Pure garbage. Package was supposed to be delivered Monday. Got a message saying that their truck had mechanical issues, no worries that happens. Next day says it was out for delivery at 7:23am. By 8pm still no package so I call in and get told that the driver is still doing deliveries until 9pm and just did a drop off less than 6 minutes earlier right by my house. I wait at the front window until I get a message at 8:47pm saying it has been rescheduled again.

What's the point of giving a delivery date then doing nothing to actually meet it. Garbage company, not the first issue I've had with them and I'll never use them again, would rather pay for shipping that get yanked around and lied to again."

"What an absolute joke of a company. Whoever runs this circus should be ashamed of themselves...
They always say the delivery is on its way, never show up and then text me saying it's Ready For Pickup. I need to know how to have them banned from my address. Amazon has already de-prioritized them but I need to ensure I never deal with Purolator again..horrible, horrible customer service. I've never despised a company so much. Make a pregnant, home bound woman constantly pick up her deliveries. Shame on you, I can't stress it enough. Horrible."

"Always have problem with Purolator. The delivery was on time but the problem is the parcel was not delivered properly. It’s the second time that we missed our delivery even though we are home. We are living in an apartment (with buzzer straight to out unit) but it happened twice that there were delivery notice sticking in the building door (not even our apartment door). Our neighbour gave us the notice and we don’t have a clue that someone attempted to deliver our parcel. Is that how you deliver? Stick the notices and just leave?! Last time, we take a cab just to pick up the box and now the box maybe to big to fit in our car. Very inconvenient!"

"This company is terrible... horrible. Been waiting over 3 days for a shipment and cannot get any kind of update over the phone or through email.

"Honestly one of the worst company experiences I’ve ever encountered. My delivery has now been withheld from me for a 4th day in a row. First day, I made arrangements to be home during the specific time they told me, for some reason there were errors and it couldn’t be delivered. Second day, driver had it in the wrong truck? same thing happened. Third day I told them I would pick it up in office to avoid this delivery problem again. IT WASNT THERE???????? Driver arrived at the destination to drop it off so that I COULD PICK IT UP AT AN OFFICE and he was 15 minutes early before the store opened so he left. Now they are saying “no guarantees” it’ll be in by tonight or tomorrow. Oh and also good luck getting through to customer service, you will be waiting a minimum of 1 hour to get through."

"This is the worst shipping company in existence! Multiple times they have said they attempted delivery despite me being home. They expect you to drive to pick up your package at their pickup center. This morning someone told me my package was on the way, an hour later I get an update saying it's now at their pickup center. Now they tell me they will only make a new attempt in four days!

I have never seen such incompetence from top to bottom. Customer service people talk to you like you are a moron for not wanting to drive 45 minutes to their pickup center... I don't have a car! Plus there is a pandemic hence the delivery instead of going to the store!

I am usually a calm and understanding person and I hate acting like an entitled ""Karen"", this isn't about being mad at a company not catering to my every whim, I just want them to stop lying to me and actually attempt to deliver my package when they say they did! It has been almost a week of updates, speaking to customer service and never, ever, hearing a knock at my door despite being plastered to my window when the update says the package is on the truck for delivery! I never even saw a truck passing through the street!

I use delivery service alot and have never seen that ever. I know people can make mistakes and I understand there can be delays or other problems sometimes but being lied to and spoken to like I am an idiot because I don't like being lied to? Never.

If you are a business using Purolator, I am never buying from you."

"This is by and far one of the worst companies I have ever used. 100% should not be in buisness. Ordered a package from a farm about twenty mins outside of my city..... On March 22nd. It's now April 30th and in the nearly six weeks it's taken the package to travel 20KMs it has arrived at their sorting facility no less than six times. Never outgoing for delivery, just moving from bin to bin. No doubt what I ordered expired a long time ago. Note that the package has never been lost, told it will be out for delivery today dozens of times and informed the company that it has a shelf life... So to the person replying to these reviews hoping to remedy the situation.... just stop. Not a single person below yourself actually cares to fix these problems, find yourself a new job before you are on E.I."

"Worst Courrier Ever. I would give them zero stars if I could. They don't even attempt to actually deliver anything, just leave a notice on your door saying that they tried (when we were home) and that you can pick up your package in the next town over. This is completely unacceptable when their shipping rates are so high. First they lost my package for 8 days, then when they finally put a tracing ""expert"" on it they suddenly found it, supposedly ""attempted"" delivery, when they didn't buzz our intercom, and left a notice that I would have to pick my package up in another town, and their pick-up hours close before I get off work. So I would have to take time off work without pay and also be out $60.00 for return cab fare to pick up a package that I already paid to have delivered to my door. What a joke. Thankfully the company I purchased from was kind enough to issue me a refund."

"If I could put 0 I'd put 0! Purolator is the worst courier service I ever had to deal with! The driver's are disrespectful and rude and the customer service doesn't honor what they say they will do, dishonest!! How can you leave a recliner sofa in the lobby of an apartment after you had the driver take it back yesterday due to him refusing to drop it at your apartment door? I spoke with Walmart and also Purolator customer service thought the issue was resolved. I was told that the recliner sofa would be dropped at my apartment door! Now today my neighbor knocked on my door to tell me a recliner sofa is in the lobby for me like wt? Now today after calling Purolator the customer service rep telling me that due to covid they don't have to drop it at your door? Yesterday I spoke with you guys, why did you not mention this? And why are you guys taking orders for furniture if you don't intend to at least leave them at the customer door after notifying the customer? I never heard of such madness! leaving it at the door is no contact if your talking about covid! And how do you expect a customer to bring up a recliner sofa from in the lobby? You should not be so misleading with customers! If you have new protocols in place then inform the customer about it! Don't accept delivery of furniture's and then leave customer stranded! This is real craziness! And stop make up lies cause if you leave a recliner sofa at a customer door this is no contact! So stop lying about covid this is why! Like who order's a sofa to be left in a lobby like cut the b.s out Purolator!!!"

"The worst courier service I have had the displeasure of being a customer for. Days spent on the phone and their online self service bot and still the same issue. No other courier service has had issues with delivering to my home at all. Just Purolator.
Driver makes no attempt at all at delivering my package. No knock at all or even their Purolator vehicle in sight. Stayed home waiting by the door for nothing.
Would not recommend them for any package delivery."

"Worst delivery company in Canada hands down! This is the third time this year I've had to drive down to their pick-up location because the ""attempted"" delivery never actually occurred and no notice card was left. We have people working in our lobby 9-5 and they didn't even see a delivery truck pull up.

The agents in chat do little to nothing to rectify the situation and the fact that there is no customer service follow up survey after the transaction tells you how little Purolator cares about the quality of their service."

"Top Service At Kingston Ontario Location!

I was helped by a very friendly lady named Tracey. She was very busy- but was so professional- even when a impatient woman was being rude to her. Covid has everyone on edge and there is a limited number of people allowed inside at one time. She dealt with the rude person calmly and diffused the situation very quickly. The irate customer- then left happy. When it was my turn to be helped- the service was Prompt AND Professional. Tracey explained to me the different shipping options and the costs involved with each. Over-all just a World Class Customer Service Experience! Thank you!!"

"Probably the worst company for shipping packages. It seems every time I order anything online that ships with Purolator there are so many issues.

"My nephew sent my 90 year old Mom ( his grandma ) a gift last week via Purolator . She was on a phone call when driver called from the main door of her condo building Friday morning. She quickly switched to that call, but the driver had gone leaving an attempted delivery slip attached to the foyer door. The slip said the package would be available for pick up at 11:00 a.m. Monday morning at a specified local Michaels store. I called the store and asked if my Mom would have to be present for pickup, as she has been in no stores since Covid. I was told that the slip would enable me to pick up on her behalf. I went to the store at just before noon on Monday. No package ... The helpful staff did a thorough search, incl. out back.. Told me I would have to call Purolator . Tried to do that, and was on hold for a very long time, and eventually gave up and rechecked the online tracking which cryptically said there had been a sorting error. Apparently the package had gone to a wrong ( unspecified ) pick up location . :( And, much as we tried, we could not discover which one. The next morning, Tuesday, the online tracking said it was out for delivery...🤔 Did that mean to my Mom’s home ( which would have been the right thing to do.. ) or to Michaels ? Again, impossible to get through on the phone to clarify the cryptic online tracking ‘info’ ... Then the online tracking said it was at another location, but as I prepared to go there, my nephew saw that it was supposed to be at Michaels ... I went there and again presented the slip. Was asked for I.d. I ( slightly testily ) explained the circumstances as briefly as possible... and was given my mom’s package 🎉🙄 Our family is very underwhelmed by Purolator, as I hope you can understand."

"We would like to reach out to Purolator today! We have had excellent service by Ray the drive here in Summerland.
He always made sure we had our packages on time. We never had to go to the depot. If we were on lunch he would make a second attempt. He went the extra mile!
Swell guy! We are so sad he has a new route now. We wish him the very best."
"I'm convinced that you need to have a single-digit IQ to deliver for Purolator. These buffoons never even show up to deliver packages, and instead say that no one was home in order to reach a quota.

Of course, when I reach out to Customer Support, they are of no help, and can't even tell me where my package is or when I will receive it. They just tell me it's ""On the way."" My package arrived 6 days late for no apparent reason whatsoever. I have never had any issues to this extent with companies like UPS and Canada Post. Purolator is the literal worst delivery company that exists."

Anything I have had delivered by Purolator the box has been damaged. 2 out of 5 deliveries go back to the sender. I have no idea why any company would use them the losses must be quite bad.

This has got to be the worst shipper ever. My building requires a LAND line to buzz people in. That's why I called ahead of delivery to make sure the driver had my cell phone number. The agent told me he can't ask the driver to use his own phone to call. So I sat in the lobby two hours. I then had to use the washroom so I went back to my apartment for 10 min. I refreshed my computer before going back down and guess what. I missed the delivery. Ran down and tried to see if maybe he was still there. Gone 5 min before I got there. 180 lb package that they are now leaving in a convenience store. This is NOT SERVICE. But they charged me 136.00 with insurance. Pathetic!

"Your live chat is hopeless ! It can’t help you solve anything yet you want us to submit a review prematurely ! I don’t even know if you actually care bout solving our issues.

Your customer service line is close to impossible to get thru and when you do and I managed to speak to someone to correct my delivery address - I don’t see that being updated on the actual tracking site. So I don’t know if he’s done this at all now. In the meantime I wish to know if my parcel is still coming on time as it’s a birthday present for my daughter who’s birthday is this weekend !

You need to modernize your website. Do away with the archaic live chat and have a customer service line that allows your customers to leave their nos so you can call them back instead and DO IT at the time you promise like TELUS do."

"The worst shipping company ever. No surprise, 91% owned by Canada post.
I have an SNR sticker on my window for deliveries. The drivers don't even bother delivering. I have contacted customer service I have spoken with supervisors I have spoken to the depot, the depot managers. No one cares, and no one is willing help, or even deliver packages, they just leave them at the drop off location. I don't have a choice on the courier, I am stuck with Purolator. My suggestion to anyone who reads this if you have a choice, DO NOT CHOOSE PUROLATOR! Not for anything, I think someone at purolator upper management should be looking at these, and remeber where they get there income from. But again, even if they did see this, no one will ever care, ""I am going do this, and no further"", a typical Canada Post responce."

"Purolator is the worst shipping company I have ever used.

- Their customer service sucks
- Their online virtual assistant doesn't work half the time
- Their phone wait times are consistently over an hour
- I have never had a Purolator shipment get delivered without hassle - there is always a delay or an undeliverable issue that requires me to drive an hour to the nearest facility to pick up

Purolator you SUCK.

I created this account just to write about how much I hate your services.

I will never, ever choose Purolator by choice."

"I live in an apartment building, with a buzzer. The code was provided, yet the driver didn't alert me they were here. Instead, I luckily had another delivery from another company so I went downstairs and discovered my parcel in a public area where anyone could have taken it. Is it really so much to ask to be buzzed, especially when there's a note posted by the apartment management stating drivers are to contact us to receive our parcels? I'm very thankful my item wasn't stolen as it was prescription food for my pet. Please do better Purolator."

"I will try my hardest not to use Purolator in the future. The company I bought my package from mistakenly provided them with my PO Box instead of a physical address. Whilst this is an honest mistake for why the package is late to be delivered, I got the address rectified 5 days ago and the package still hasn't been delivered even though they said it would be the next business day. I called them again yesterday and was on hold for 45 minutes just to make sure they had the correct address which they do but the delivery driver is unable to find my address (Even though I get packages delivered here weekly in a suburban area). I asked them to leave the package at the receiving depot in my town yesterday so I could physically pick it up myself but they could not even organise that with the driver stating yet again that he could not find the address. On top of all this, they haven't even bothered to call me except for the first time about the address change and I have had to follow this up all myself. Avoid them if you can."

"Package was being delivered within the city on amazon prime.
I first get an 'oversized' delay, just says they'll contact me, but then the next day it's out for delivery on a truck. No contact. Great.
10:30pm rolls around and now the truck has had a mechanical delay. That was four days ago. Any request for an update is met with 'please check back with the tracking system'. No idea where it is, can't pick it up, because the support can't verify where it is.

My package had to travel a whopping distance of 20km.
I'm pretty sure it's lost, and if not, severely damaged. I'll be refusing delivery and getting my refund back from Amazon. At this point I don't trust them to get me my package in one piece."

"Against my better judgment I decided to save a bit and to give Purolator a shot at delivering a letter. Paid for overnight service (Friday morning) and they didn't deliver the package due to a missing buzzer code (which wasn't asked for on the documents I had filled out), No worries, ultimately this package could be delivered Monday. Used their online service (Friday night) to update the info and took a screen shot of the confirmation. Now it's Monday and the package still isn't out for delivery, claiming it still needs a buzzer code. I've been on hold now for over half an hour waiting to speak to someone on their customer service phone line. Lesson learned, always use FedEX if you want your package to arrive on time.
Edit: Finally spoke with a human and explained my unhappiness... they concluded the call by calling me “Steven”... looks like they really value my business. Avoid unless you really like a painful experience!!!"

Absolute ducking trash help line is $hit and workers are incompatant to the degree of not knowing how to do their job.

I literally wish I could give it zero stars. I’ve ordered the same thing with them twice and they refused to contact me both times about the delivery. Their excuse is they don’t give drivers company phones so it’s the driver’s choice to notify you of the delivery or not. And there’s literally no way for me to get my package from them cause they won’t contact me and they won’t leave it there for me to pick up later. Just a really frustrating company. The only way to get it is for me to physically go to the warehouse and get it. What a waste. I’m just going to get a refund.

Order was placed Saturday.

I would have chosen a different service if I knew Purolator would not deliver the service it promised. Very disappointed and not convinced I'll receive the item even tomorrow."

"DON NOT USE THIS COMPANY! This place is HORRIBLE! A lady calls me to tell me that my package was meant to come that day and I told her I was at the gym so she can drop it off. They don’t and say they will the next day. I wait and wait hoping to see my mail the next day and nothing and this package I was meant to be an emergency and now everything was messed up. My package is just running around, I keep getting notifications that it’s on vehicle at 11am, it’s almost their end time which is 4:30pm and still nothing and no word from them. So unprofessional."
"It's too bad that we can't choose who we want to have delivered our packages. Purolator is getting as bad as UPS. Not only myself, but others I know, are having packages ""delayed due to delay in ferry"" and ""severe weather conditions"" when the ferry isn't delayed, as I know people who work on the ferry. And the weather isn't bad. I checked forecasts in the areas where my packages are ""delayed"" and I say it's laziness. Getting paid by the hour I guess. Maybe you need to hire people who are willing to do their job and get packages to the destination on time with excuses. If they were valid? Sure. But ""weather delays"" when the weather is perfect is down right bs."

Absolutely the worst service I have ever had. Paid extra for 2 day service 13 days later still not delivered and after calling them multiple times they had no legitimate reason. Finally I was told it would be there on April 1 so we waited all day nothing .I called again they said cuz of covid they aren't doing deliveries they only drop a pick up card which had not been said on any of the other calls so then I was told can pick it up Tuesday April 6 all together 21 days if u have a choice use any one else for your own sanity

"My experience with Purolator is equally frustrated with the rest of the reviews. The first time, I ordered through Amazon, Amazon uses them. Their system says my goods will be delivered on a certain date but it comes a day earlier, I was totally unprepared. Of course, when I trying to reach their Customer Service there were more than 30 minutes wait. I gave up and cancelled my order, Amazon apologized and refunded my money. The second time, I knew they were coming as I tracked them. My intercom is not programmed as the building is new. I left a note on the intercom to asked them to call my mobile phone. Again, they left a slip that says they don't have a phone with them. who doesn't have a phone these days? Are they not allowed to call the customer for delivery? Amazon calls customer during delivery. Amazon can do it why not Purolator? Purolator, you better put your act together, or else you are going to lose all business!"

If you try to call customer service, you have to wait 30-40 min, you don't have any waiting number or estimated time. Just try and error. After this long wait, you are going to talk to a rude robot-like agent and their answer for everything is sorry, I can not do anything about this issue. Such a waste of time and money.

"Ordered kids rain boots from SportChek and they were picked up in Ottawa on 22 March 2021, by Purolator to be shipped to Belleville, 250 kilometres away. These boots were taken to Vancouver, 4700 kilometres away to a sorting facility then transferred to another sorting facility in the Vancouver area on 26 March. As of 31 March the tracker shows boots are still sitting there in Vancouver. Complained to Purolator and was advised boots should be delivered around the 5 April. Assuming I get them that will be over 2 weeks for boots to travel what should have been 250 km. These boots will have travelled over 10,000 km by the time I get them at which point they will be returned to SportChek for a refund as I already picked up some boots at Walmart."

What I like with Purolator is that they really put the emphasis on the surprise factor with your delivery. Pay for a 2-day delivery? You'll get it when we feel like it! Want a refund? Screw that! You paid for the surprise factor.

"I ordered a product at Best Buy Canada and since their partner business is Purolator (unfortunately), I was waiting for my package to ship to my house. I first get a notification saying that the product label was created. The day after, I get another email saying that the package was recieved from Best Buy and is in Purolator facility at Niagara somewhere. Then I get another email the day after saying that it went to the wrong location. I needed this product by Monday and I ordered it on Thursday. They passed my location good time and went farther to where ever they felt like going. So my package ended up arriving on Friday. It took LONGER than a week to get the product. In this case, it wouldve been better to just shop offline and get it right on the spot. Again, I NEEDED this product by Monday or Tuesday at latest. Wasn't able to use it since it didn't deliver on time. TERRIBLE experience and their service is a joke. DO NOT use their service. I wish I could give negative stars, cuz it'll be negative 5 stars."
"This company is a joke when it comes to delivering couriers. I was expecting some important documents from Indian Embassy (via BLS) which were regarding my passport and very crucial for my visa application. The Embassy sent me an email saying the documents are shipped. When I come home I see the sticky note fallen on the ground, luckily didn't get blown away with the wind. I end up going to the address mentioned on the note and they tell me that the package was sent back to the Embassy BY MISTAKE. When I ask for a drop off label to be provided as I had already paid of this shipment, they tell me to contact the Embassy. After multiple attempts calling up the Embassy helpline, they basically ask me to pay and create another label. The policy is to keep the package for 5 days, but in this case they sent the documents back the very next day. Now I have to go in circles looking for my documents or send in a new application if the package is never found. Such a waste of time and money. Massive disappointment.!!! USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK...!!!!!"

"Total incompetence. Paid for express shipping, the parcel was placed on the wrong truck so it didn't arrive on the expected delivery day. Contacted live chat, they couldn't do anything except tell me that it will arrive the next day. It was still early in the day, if they really wanted to honour express shipping and do something for a customer they could have done something to have the parcel delivered on the same day."

"Whenever I place an order online and upon checkout I find that it will be delivered by Purolator, my heart sinks. And for the very same reason for every single ""delivery"".

Even if you are at home, sitting right next to the door, you will never know that Purolator attempted a delivery. The only way you will ever know they were ever there is you find a ""Delivery Attempted"" notice. It was so bad with one company I dealt with, they dropped them as their delivery agent. They received so many complaints about the exact thing I am complaining about in such a short amount of time, they dropped them.

Now I know how this plays out. Purolator will play like they want to fix the issue and really deal with it, but nothing will actually get done. You'll hear the usual, ""But our drivers are instructed to knock on a door or ring the bell"". Sorry, there is an actual difference between supposed to do it and actually doing it.

I would strongly suggest that you do not use this company. Especially if you need a guaranteed delivery. It simply won't get to you during that promised time. And even though you've paid extra for expedited shipping, you're still going to end up picking the damn package up yourself.

Read the other reviews for yourself. This is an ongoing issue with this company and they've simply refused to try and rectify the problem. Despite years of promising to do so. I am in serious disbelief as to how this company continues to operate."

"Seems to be a theme for this company. I'm at home all day expecting a small parcel not requiring a signature, at about 5 pm check my mailbox and there's a slip saying the item couldn't be delivered ... Uh why not!?

They were perfect. The guy delivering it was very kind and when I asked about when my package would arrive customer support was very helpful... I was skeptical when I saw all the bad reviews but I guess it depends on who is delivering the packages..
"My experience is like everyone else. Received text notice that driver ‘tried’ to deliver my package but couldn’t get in the building. All the details about delivery are in my account so that’s nonsense. After a 40 minute wait on hold to Purolator customer service. I found a very nice csr who believed me: that I was home, no delivery was attempted and no notice left. She promised to forward the complaint to her manager. I also called Amazon and told them the same story. The Amazon agent told me that all the delivery complaints she receives are about Purolator. I had to wait 6 hours until the fake driver took it back to the depot and scanned it. Then I was able to drive 30 minutes to pick it up. The Amazon rep said Purolator drivers don’t like delivering to apartments. Please understand I’m talking about a 2 story building with 8 apartments, no security and really easy access. I do a lot of online shopping and Purolator is the only delivery agent that is a problem. If there are too many complaints they will lose the Amazon account. I can hardly wait for that to happen."

"The most terrible shipping company! I can't stress enough how poor their service is! They never delivered my packages, they only left sticky notes that they'd missed me! Although, I was at home all day but they never even bothered to call my buzzer! Then I went to a pick up location and it wasn't there! Some customer service lady promised it would be redelivered but they never came!! What a MESS!!! I had to chase my package and waste lots of time and energy! Awful company! Stay away and never open business accounts with them otherwise it will ruin your reputation too!"

"I'm surprised they are still around, they shouldn't be though.
I heard from a coworker the drivers don't even have a cellphone, no wonder...
As usual, it's management's fault, they have so many bad reviews all over the internet and what do they do? they hire a ""social media coordinator"" who only apologizes and posts woke crap instead of working on giving a good service. Anyways, the only thing I can do as a customer is not to buy from companies who use Purolator."

"The driver didn't deliver the package. Did not ring the doorbell at all. I could see the truck backing and leaving. Customer support is worst, they said there is nothing they can do about it and that we should wait 3 more days now. What a joke you guys are!"
"Horrible service.

The I saw the driver leaving from my window so I ran outside to get my package and what I see instead is a notice of attempt. The driver did not even bother to ring the bell and just decided to leave the notice of delivery failure.

Called the Customer service and surprise... they say they cannot call the the driver to come back to deliver when he was still in my area. And instead offers delivery on Tuesday, 4th day from today. Wow I mean wow...

Be aware and DO NOT i repeat DO NOT order any item being delivered by Purolator. Worst service ever."

we have to bring it back and pick up another one because we are not sure if it is damaged and would not be setting it up before June to figure out if it works or not so thankfully they will exchange it for us... have it all on front door camera!"

"Your above noted claim is respectfully declined as the guitar case was not boxed to protect it from being damaged. Also, this shipment was shipped OSNR (shipper authorized no signature on delivery) which is at the shippers risk, a declination letter is to follow.
In regards to the above, I have been involved in Quality Management for the past thirty years. Your decision to not accept this claim is deplorable and wrong. Having put my trust in your service was my first mistake, and will EVER happen again. I will also be sure to share my disgust in Purolator and it's whole customer service process to all that will listen.

At no time, did anyone suggest that my shipment should be in a box as stated. In FACT, the guitar was in it's own case (box) designed to protect the inner working of the guitar inside. Having put another box around the case would not have protected the guitar any more. As you can plainly see, the case was damaged by your service and by your poor handling.The guitar is also damaged as a result of rough handling. Why would anyone insure a thousand dollar with your terms?

As well, having to wait almost a month to have my claim even reviewed, is unacceptable and points to a poor customer satisfaction process, complete with no confirmation of said claim when it was started, and a total lack of accountability on Purolators behalf.

Your decision not to honour this claim is baseless in my opinion and without merit. Your terms and conditions are hidden unless you read the fine print. Why does Purolator have so many claims that they cannot even respond until a month later?

I am not sure if you are still ISO approved, but if you are, I will be making a complaint to the auditing body as well.

I put my trust and confidence in you to get my guitar to its safe destination, without even an apology as to the damage you caused, i am now left with a damaged guitar that most likely has a bent guitar neck from being dropped, and a severely damaged guitar case that was designed to protect the guitar itself, as well.

Thank you for the quality lesson on how not to serve the customer.

Purolator please do not respond unless you want to make this right!"

"As a bldg manager I must remind Purolator that due to COVID all deliveries must be CONTACTLESS. Quite a few of your guys are EXTREMELY rude and it may be your policy not to leave pkgs, as per bldg instructions, at a secure location in the bldg then u should not be making deliveries. We are often subject to verbal abuse by your delivery personnel and there will come a time when they will be banned from entering the bldg and have no other choice but to have your customers collect their pkgs at your hub."

"I would give 0 stars if trustpilot allows me to! Paid seller for expeditied delivery, and has been waiting next to the door of my house since I received the SMS notice. No doorbell, no knocking, no package left on the porch, but a missed delivery SMS notice and a slip on my door an hour later. Tracking says receiver unavailable, but I really do not know how I can make myself more available. The only explaination to this is clearly that the driver did not bother to actually deliver the package since leaving a slip is much faster.
Looked up the forum, this kind of issue has been prevalent for purolator for years. Then contacted customer service. They are largely unapologetic and kept restating the fact that delivery was attempted and no one was home, even after I told them about how I waited for my package. It is clear that they know themselves that the driver probably did not bother, but they cannot say it and the company has no intention to make up for the error to its customers. When I further complained to their representative, she closed the chat on me. Horrible horrible! I will avoid buying from sellers who use purolator, or sending packages through them in the future.
I use a ring doorbell so I have full evidence of the driver not actually delivering the package, by the way. Even in the face of this, purolator is still shameless enough to offer no compensation whatsoever. I will report them to the anti-fraud center.
Edit: 2 phone calls and 1 live chat later, they finally bothered to deliver my package 4 hours after initial trip."

"They never actually try and deliver to my apartment which is in front of the metro and no other company has an issue at ALL delivering. They also, always make me drive to a completely different city for my parcel. Every time, they don’t even have the courtesy to leave a pick up note, Purolator then marks in their systems “correct address” & “no buzzer code” when I called them hours before and the dispatch gave them the code I provided them. It is a complete SCAM and when I talk to the 24/7 chat bot, it does not even make changes I made for the address and pick up inside the system. It stays marked the same “correct address” then talking through chat to a rep, he says something completely different. It is a complete scam to pressure you in to make money, capitalist greed. They can’t even do anything when you contact them, it is ridiculous, It is a very unprofessional company and needs to be reviewed, can’t even delivery a package."
Worst delivery service. Drivers completely incompetent. There express delivery is you have to pick up and delivery your own package because drivers don’t have the competence to follow direction or find address which is the only two things there job is to do. Don’t waste your time or money there a joke.
"Their drivers are NOT using their brain. My package has a full address, and apartment nr, no buzzer code, the driver did not try to reach me, just left and until now did not receive my modem. What for a terrible management is there, they do not train their drivers to love their job."

"I had a problem, they said they would take care of things and my package was almost sent back because ""my address was not valid"". ??????????"
If I could give a rating of less than 1 star I would. I have never seen such incompetence. Even when you call the help desk and ask questions its like pulling teeth to get a straight answer. WOW how is this company even in business!! I would recommend anyone ordering online to ask the company to use a different delivery service!!! it will save you pulling your hair out.
"Purolator was supposed to deliver a package to my 90 year old grandmother on Friday as she cant' get to the post office. They left a slip saying they were there but didn't ring the doorbell. I called and they wouldn't go back same day so we had to wait till Monday. That is today and they did the same thing. I know she was home and awake both times as I called her to let her know they would be there soon as I received notifications before actual delivery. The second time she put up a note beside her buzzer number with her name on it in bold but they still didn't ring the doorbell. I was told today by Nadine a manager they once again could not go back to deliver it same day. I have now arranged someone to drive her to pick it up at the Purolator depot. Purolator is ripping people off by charging more for home delivery of items that don't take place. If people have to do to the depot to pick up, it is the same as Canada post for twice the price. Purolator should be ashamed of themselves, their poor work ethic, dishonesty and unaccountability. I boycotted this company for about 25 years due to massive issues with them before. I was hopeful things had changed but apparently not so I will not use them again in the future. Ever. There is nothing they can say or do to fix this. I am awaiting on a refund right now for service I paid for but did not receive. The most hilarious part is that Purolator is using Canada Post to send it via snail mail and it will take 4-6 weeks to arrive. When paying with credit card they can't issue a refund to the same credit card. I will be keeping all my phone recordings and documentation in case I don't get that refund. Incompetence at it's finest."

"Background information: I live in an apartment building which closed off access to the public for the safety of the residents in this pandemic. So far I've had 2 deliveries by Purolator failed because Purolator does not accomodate people in my circumstances. They do not call upon arrival, to be more precise they cannot call you as they are not provided cell phones. Since they do not have access and can't call, I have to pick up my packages from the drop off location which is very far from where I live. What is the point of paying for shipping if it does not get delivered?
Even if Amazon doesn't have access to my building, they call me so that I can pick up my package from them. Purolator why don't you?"

"If I could put NO STARS I would! This company is crap! I always ordered from an online clothing store and had no problem with them being delivered at my residence because...you know...they just leave it at the front door unattended anyway. That's okay cos I have nice neighbors. I decided to take a gamble and have it delivered at my work instead. So I am not too worried because I have had no issues with being delivered at my work through Amazon and then Purolator comes along and said they attempted delivery and their excuse was ""inaccessible!"" I mean what the hell is that!? Sure, it's a business building, but why is it SOOOOOO hard for them to just contact me. And also they included they attempted delivery...NOPE. I'm a receptionist! I can see everything at the front door or maybe their incompetent driver are just lazy. Also, DO NOT trust their chat! They are horrible. They keep telling me something else and after spending almost a whole day on the chat and then with the company I ordered the stuff for, I finally got a hold of someone who is really nice. She asked me to email her all the information and after spending another hour or so speaking with her on email, I tracked it again and tells me they are attempting delivery the next day. SO I was happy with that, but I check it this morning and now it says they were ""unable to deliver - returned to sender."" I mean...WHAT? It says here they apparently they attempted delivery 5:30AM. SO of COURSE no one is at the building.

DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY! I want other companies to NOT USE THEM!"

"Purolator, no phone call again, tracking number is 606783921806 item is no longer in Fort St John it is now in Prince George and heading back to seller apparently. These parcels have my mailing address on them and as such it would make more sense to mail them to me from Fort St John then to send them all the way back to where the parcels come from if Purolator isn't going to call me. What's really sad is that there is my name on the parcel and no attempt made at all to get in touch with me. I'm in the phone book in white pages and am the only person with my name on facebook etc. The number of times I order from Ebay and no phone call from perolator indicates that they don't value my business. They have a system that could easily have my name in it with my phone number so they could call me when parcels don't have my phone number on them. I still can't figure out how Purolator ends up with my parcels that were supposed to go to my mailing address which is registered on ebay under my account shipping address, and with amazon under my account shipping address. With my long History of not getting my parcels I at least know why I'm not getting them, and no Purolator I don't have a cell phone, but I have an email address. So good news with the package heading back to Ontario, I was able to contact Purolator and get package rerouted back to FSJohn at no extra cost. I am also now leaving special instructions with each seller to include my phone number so that the couriers can contact me. Thus far all the UPS parcels that don't include my phone number they take to Canada post to get them to where they need to get to, to me."

"So, I haven't received my package yet, and I may update this post in a few days. Somehow, my 1 lb package is now delayed for possibly 4-7 days for being ""oversized"" (same exact scenario as another poster), or ""due to pandemic disruption""- I can't tell which as they both appear on the tracking. I did call, and the phone agent was very polite and did his best to be helpful (hence why I am giving some tentative stars), but unfortunately he wasn't able to understand why the parcel was scanned ""oversized"" either.

Anyway, I'll post an update shortly. However, I did want to call out that the phone agent did his best, and that I hope folks go easy on call center agents...it isn't an easy job, they don't have a ton of agency, and often bear the brunt of the public's ire."

"So I order from Amazon Canada on a Saturday and its for delivery 5 days later as its coming from the USA. I'm OK with that. Then I see that its going to be delivered by Purolator who a day before the delivery date advise me that the delivery could be delayed by 7 days, the reason being the parcel is oversized. How the hell is a 1 pound package oversized!!! Get on time deliveries from Amazon from JoeyCo but with Purolator its most always late. Pathetic unreliable company that uses Covid as an excuse for poor service."

"Absolutely nightmare. This is a shipwreck mascarading as a company.
Everyone here is wildly INCOMPETENT and deserves to be fired.
4 pickups schedules, 4 missed and no showed. Endless hours on the phone, agents saying they would send confirmation emails they never sent. Managers supposed to call, never does.

Delivery driver comes on 5th time, absolute A-hole who swears and shouts expletives for asking about missed pickups. Everyone here is either stupid, mean or both.

The richmond delivery/pickup driver is this tall brunette kid who looks strung out on drugs with wild eyes and gets all aggressive, swears, after a simple question anyone would ask. Called me a b***, said he didn't f*** care, its not his f*** problem, you stupid c***

Their customer service does not care. Their managers do not care.
DO NOT USE THEM for any reason unless you enjoy wasting days and hours of your life and being verbally assaulted by staff"

"I have an expensive delivery coming. It managed to go from Brampton to Guelph overnight. Then it was at Guelph for seven hours before it went ""out for delivery"". Then, two hours later I get a mysterious note on the app that there was a ""mechanical delay/delayed due to pandemic"" and told to contact purolator. When I contact someone I get told that it was actually never on the truck and that someone mis-scanned the item.

I basically wasted my time following the instruction to contact Purolator - all it did was raise my blood pressure and give me even more concerns about my shipment.

Given my experience now and in the past I am seriously concerned that the driver either got lazy after realizing he/she had a busy day or my item (a highly-sought after item) ""fell off the truck""."

"Purolator how many time will you do the same thing to me? You keep claiming you have come to deliver my products meanwhile, you never showed up. The same old story all the time. I have been home since morning and only for me to see that you are claiming delivery attempt failed just as you did with my computer in the middle of COVID and you never delivered it so I had to risk my life and my little girl’s life in the middle of covid, spent more money as I paid for Uber for going and coming just to pick it up where you left it because you never wanted to deliver it but you claimed that you did. Now it is about another package and you are still pretending to be trying to deliver to me and never saw me. If I knew Purolator would be the one to deliver this product, I would not have ordered it at all because I already know you will only give me stress. You are very unprofessional and not straightforward so I cannot recommend anyone to use your company. I am still waiting for my product and you are claiming your fake delivery as usual. Stop faking delivery. Stop deceiving yourself by deceiving people. If there is any way to remove my one star, I would remove it because you do not deserve any star from me."

"Their 1-888-SHIP-123 customer service line never works. You wait forever to be hung-up on. When you call back, somehow... the system never takes you call again... like they filtered your number to go straight to GREET_AND_HANG_UP. I don't mind waiting in line... but don't hand up or reject my call. That's unacceptably rude if nothing else!

The FRAUD... is they don't deliver packages. They deliver ""Sorry, we missed you"" post cards. They don't deliver period. Your package was NEVER on that truck! I watched the driver walk up to my building with no package then walk out. A minute later I get an email alert that they could not reach me. My building logs ALL entrances.... they never entered!! My building's cameras have it on video... they walked up to the window and left their nasty ""post card"" only. Today with digital surveillance everywhere... how long do they think they will keep getting away with this?

The BEST PART: I was expecting my delivery tomorrow. When you call customer service you are only greeted with a ""due to COVID.. and for the safety of our employee and customers... expect a 1 to 3 day delay"". Well they got here 1 day early... without notice or warning. How was I to know, the EMPTY-HANDED delivery driver was there for me!?
And now... for COVID ""safety"" reasons... Purolator is FORCING US customers to leave self-isolation and ALL GATHER together as roaches in a small crammed ""pick-up"" waiting room. Purolator's ""disingenuous"" business practices during this pandemic is ENCOURAGING the SPREAD of COVID.

This is the kind of company that makes you lose faith in the whole system... that such a garbage service is even allowed to do business... makes you wonder just how BAD do things need to get... short of burning your packages at your front steps. I'm now insulted by anyone who uses them to send me anything!"

"Horrible unprofessional business and customer support, the rep actually argued with me that the driver delivered the package and it was someone else's mistake. They don't know how to deliver packages, they don't know how to enter apartments, if you call their phone it will ring for hours, I would not trust them to deliver anything of value you will not get it. You're probably better off picking up items at their facility because it will not ever find your home especially if you live in an apartment, they won't text or call you, or attempt to reach you or enter your building. I wish Shaw would stop using them as their delivery choice, I would much rather just go with Canada Post, at least they will put things in a mailbox."

"What a HORRIBLE outfit! I had 2 deliveries in the last 2 weeks and although I’ve been home for both, did they even attempt to buzz my apt number to let me know that they were here????NOT!!! What’s the point in calling yourself a courier company when I HAVE TO GO PICK UP MY PACKAGES ANYWAY??? You guys are horrible and if I’m ever in the need of a package to be delivered, I’ll suggest a different company and I’ll even pay extra for that to happen!!
Also, why do you ask people to sign up for the service for letting us know that a package is on its way when, YOU CAN’T EVEN GET THAT RIGHT!!"
Two weeks since item picked up in Fredericton and shipped to Halifax (4 hour drive) and item still not arrived!! They don’t even seem embarrassed. Must be the pandemic.....ha ha! Do not use!!!
"Definitely, the worst of them all. Was expecting an Amazon "" PRIME"" delivery today. Saw the Purolator truck in the parking lot.......waited for by suite buzzer to ring....nothing. He left.....Then...I Got an email saying "" Sorry we missed you crap"" . He didnt ring the buzzer, he didnt leave a sticker saying when and where I could pick up my delivery. This has been about the 8th time this has happened....to me! Apparently, this driver has alot of complaints in against him for this same stuff. Seriously....how does this company stay in business!!!!
I will be forwarding my last 3 tracking numbers....all of which I was home for."

"Purolator is the worst delivery service. I sent my important immigration docs via express on March 2, 2021. The status of package was still at SORT FACILITY after 5 days. When contacted customer service, they opened an investigation and few days later I was told that
""We have completed the investigation. We are unable to provide a valid proof of delivery as all search responses were negative. At this time We will need to close this case file, please accept our apologies.""

"The worst courier company in Kelowna. They do not deliver, text or call when packages arrive. Mine was returned without any attempt to notify me.

"Purolator notified me thru email that my package has been delivered. So I immediately went outside my house to see the package and to my surprise no package was there. So I checked their tracking website and it state that my package was delivered to to PUROLATOR GROUND at SHIP DOCK of MIS TRUCK 1115 CARDIF, L5S1L8 which is not the final destination of the package. Why will Purolator even say that the package has been delivered if it was not delivered to the final destination. Purolator is the worst shipping company that I dealt with. Not comparable to US shipping companies like UPS, FEDEX and USPS. I will not be surprise to see this shipping company go busted because of their poor service. They try to do everything to make their stats looks good even though it is not accurate. Very very disappointed with this company and will not use this company for any of my shipping needs."

"First, I put one star, because we cannot put 0.

We receive packages delivered by different companies. Only Purolator is not able to find the address...
Moreover, when you replan the delivery and give them your mobile to call you to help them.. they just don’t deliver, and they say the “receiver is unavailable” without calling you…

BTW, I really think they don’t event try to deliver as we have someone 24/24 at the reception….
It is not he first it happens with them, it is rule not the exception. That’s why I take the time to write this review and actually I have plenty of time because I try to reach their support by phone, I have been listening to their music on the phone for now 36 minutes with no estimates of how long I will have to wait.
Of course, they warn you that there is a punctual overload of people calling, but whatever the time you call you have the warning !!! (and the waiting ..)
So, I think we should all tell merchants to not use Purolator for their delivery, and if they still do, don’t order from them.
We need to push Purolator out of business, no one deserves a so bad service."

If the address is valid [not correcting to STN MAIN] when entering the information then the package should not make it halfway to the destination before they decide to force the customer to come and pick up the package. We were going to send it with UPS because they deliver to the address but Purolator said that they also deliver and at a slightly cheaper cost but it isn't worth it is the customer has to drive and pick up the package.

"We were shipping a battery, I have never put them in a box before(I've been doing this for 2 1/2 years) and it's never been an issue. However this time it was an issue. I left work after I was done shipping because I was ill. Didn't think anything of it until I check my messages Friday morning,only to discover it was an issue. I called the lady and explained what happened and that I was sick and not at work, asked her to please help this once and I'd make sure going forward to put them in boxes. She said no she was gonna send it back to me. This was 3 days after the initial pick up. We wouldn't get it back till Monday and the customer had already been waiting. I was very upset that she wouldn't help and told her so. I sent someone down to put it in a box. Which they did and Purolator left their tag on it so it still got sent back. I called several times and a manager called me back was rude and then never called again. Found out a day later the driver knew it wasn't packaged properly but still took it. He says he spoke to the new guy which he did, but he's new and barely speaks English so he didn't really understand what he was being told. Now Purolator driver's are driving over curbs and parking like fools when they come here. There is zero accountability and they really don't care that they provide horrible service. Both Chris and Tracy at the regina branch shouldn't hold management positions as they don't care about customer service and that's kinda their job!"

"Delivery has now been delayed over a month, I paid $35 to ensure my package would arrive within 3 business days. I understand there are covid delays, but I contact customer support and they assure me it will be delivered the following day, so I take time off work and stay home all day waiting in Ann important delivery, I have had friends come to my house from 8am until I am off work to ensure someone is there to meet the driver. Over a MONTH this has been going on! I was told the driver couldn’t find the address, then I was told it was failed to be delivered because the driver didn’t have a buzzer code. I live in a house! No buzzer code required! And the address is correct, I have confirmed it repeatedly with purolator. I called customer service AGAIN yesterday and was ASSURED my package would be on the truck this morning, then I get an email from customer service today saying it’s been returned to sender. If you have the option, DO NOT use Purolator. You’re better off using carrier pidgeon."

"If there was an option for minus stars i would use those..
Ordered a package off Amazon to be delivered by Purolator, got notification it was delivered yesterday.
NOT....
Tried to resolve the issue with both companies and was told by both, that i would have to wait for their ""investigation"" to be done.
When i asked where I could leave a review the agent would i was chatting with exited the chat without any answer or goodbye....
Crappy service and horrible customer service.
Will avoid Purolator at all costs from now on.

As for the socalled reply,
sending a reply that is done by pasting a preformulated response to make me go through the exact hoops i alrady had to jump through, is NOT helpful.
And there is no email contact that I could find for customer service complaints."

"Worse courier of all! It is owned by Canada Post - that explains it! Parcels sit in their distribution centre for days/weeks! It is worth paying extra if need be, to get different courier service - anybody but Purolator!

UPDATED 8 March, 2021
So received my parcel today! It appears my parcel had left the warehouse but Purolator had not updated their tracking! In the end, my parcel arrived earlier then expected - it automatic that Purolator issues a standard "" your parcel may be delayed 7 to 14 days......etc"" message to all recipients???? This should only be issued when it is legitimate ...... not standard with all shipments! And..... Purolator should update their tracking system so it can be trusted!"

"Garbage delivery service, tells you to contact them then doesn't answer. Embarrassment of a company. Deliver your packages yourself because they won't do it."
"The motto for Purolator should be: ""Purolator. The least is the best we can do!""
I cringe whenever I order something and it comes via Purolator. I will honestly pay extra for the vendor to use anyone else. Example:
Purolator Express (Next Day) shows up 3 days after expected, I've seen ""weather delays"" listed on the site, meanwhile it's been clear, no snow on the ground and plus temps, the depots within 2 hrs of each other. (Toronto to St Catharines).
Purolator Ground, let's not even try to discuss that. That's more offensive than a bad punchline to a joke.
If you desire to really upset someone, dislike your ex and want to teach them or have an enemy you are forced to send something to, use Purolator and give them the tracking number and sleep knowing they will be stressed looking at the most useless tracking site.
I've got plenty of tracking numbers I keep so I can show people how sad they are."
"This is the second time I have had the misfortune to have someone ship something using Purolator.

They are the worst delivery service I have ever had the misfortune to be the victim of. My package arrived at the sorting facility 5 miles from my home and as far as I know it is still there, 6 days and counting.

The item is urgent and I pointed that out, no doubt that will delay it further. All I get is ""we are trying to trace your item"". It is in their facility I can tell them that I don't need to track it.

I ordered 2 identical items on the same day, one was delivered on time (not Putolaror) the other, who knows.

They are useless, avoid using Purolator."

Received noticed that a package I was expecting was delivered and left at the front door. Was home all day and no package had been delivered. When I called customer service they confirmed the package was delivered and said they checked the drivers GPS and he was at my house. Interesting because the package was delivered the following day. So why was their driver supposedly at my house the day before because that what their GPS told them. Something is not right.

"I contacted customer support to indicate that package tracking showed it was delivered, although it was not was received. In my same-day response, I noted that I had checked my Nest Hello video and confirmed there was no activity. Three days later, I received a response, requesting the product information and a video copy. Of course, the video history was only five days, so it was no longer accessible. Purolator indicated they checked the route inspection and said the GPS shows the driver at my address. They asserted that they had confirmed delivery. Further, they noted that since the shipment indicated no signature required, I should contact the shipper. And, not unexpectedly, the vendor cannot help me because I ordered the package via Amazon. At this point, we have Purolator saying they ""confirm delivery"" and myself indicating that I had watched a video three times over for the entire day with no evidence of any attempted delivery. I requested a way to escalate my concern, at which time Purolator closed my send and sent me a customer satisfaction survey email.

I called Purolator customer service, gave the case contact number, re-explained my issue, and asked to talk to a manager. After some back and forth in frustrating conversation, I asked to have the GPS tracking information. The manager read me the coordinates. I prompted entered this into Google and discovered that the location was almost half-a-kilometre east of my home. I challenged the manager that this did not constitute a ""confirmed delivery."" He suggested that the driver probably put the package on a trolley several packages to deliver to multiple houses. I was baffled as I had never seen any courier ever deliver in this manner in my suburban neighbourhood. After some back and forth dialogue in escalating frustration, he bluntly asked if I wanted anything else. I asked for further escalation to an ombudsman, to which he provided the phone number for head-office. That phone number simply connects to an employee directory with no operator assistance.

My claims and customer service complaints are listed as follows:

Lack of timely request for the video. The email exchange with customer service could have requested the video right away.

Burden of proof on the consumer. Both agents made me feel that the burden of proof was on me by continuing to throw back the request for a video. There was never any suggestion, hint or recognition that they bore any responsibility.

Disingenuous regarding delivery confirmation. The customer exchange via email incorrectly indicated they had GPS proof of delivery to my exact address. This was a lie, untrue. Further, the manager escalation claim that the courier delivered it by foot 400m in the middle of February was blatantly a baseless tactic. No resident of my neighbour would claim to have ever witnessed this by any courier at any time.

Lack of empathy and argumentative. My interaction with the manager showed him defensive and argumentative, lacking any compassion or remorse in any form.

Disrespectful in requests for escalation. Requesting an escalation to have a case closed and asking for a further escalation but being directed to a generic company directory showed a complete disregard for concerns.

Presently, Amazon has refunded the $10.97 for the cake pan, which Purolator had lost or failed to deliver. I am writing this because Purolator should not be allowed to get away with treating its customers in such a manner. This has nothing to do with the money but rather an acknowledgement that Purolator has shirked responsibility for not delivering its service. And acknowledging that it had been both disingenuous and disrespectful in its customer interactions.

My claims are as follows:

1. Purolator failed to deliver a package, despite marking it as delivered to my address;

2. Purolator placed an undue burden of proof on the receiver and did not request key information in a timely manner;

3. Purolator was disingenuous about the evidence that it has delivered the package, misrepresenting that their data indicated tracking to my exact address;

4. Purolator has failed to implement best practices, such as attaching a photo to the delivery tracking, which has become commonplace during the pandemic; and,

5. Purolator acted disrespectfully in not providing the consumer with an avenue for escalation by closing an email case prematurely and directing me to call a generic business directory."

When I first read the customer reviews on purolator on March 3rd I was really discouraged. My package was picked up by purolator on March 3rd and not knowing what to expect I left a 1 star review pending when I receive my package. And at about 4pm today March 4th my package was delivered. So this is the reason for this review to upgrade my customer experience to 5 star.

"The customer service is good, however the delivery service is horrible, I wasted two days at home because they said they would be here, they never showed, I was willing to over look this due to the pandemic, that said when they lied and said they attempted to make the delivery but ""recipient unavailable"" I decided to simply go pick up the shipment my self."

"My order said it was delivered at 2:12pm to be exact but I never received it. Nor anyone buzz in. And i went to see the description from the tracking site. And it says “left in my front door”. But my order wasnt there. Idk how but i never seen a purolator truck pass by my house, nor even heard a buzzer. I was at my living room at that time and i never saw anyone came in, buzz in or even left my order in front of my house."
"We waited at home all day to receive a delivery today, purolator rang the bell at 17:30 i missed the call and called back in 2 sec opened the door to him but he entered the building and instead delivering the parcel to the second floor he filled pick up ticket and disappeared literally in 30 seconds! How do i know that??? Because i was downstairs in 45 - 60 seconds to catch him but he was gone! I called customer service but lady on the phone was just trying to justify delivery guys action by saying that i should have answer the phone and said something! Well when i called back the system buzzer worked and opened the door apparently, that's why he was in the building!! Baad service Purolator!"

"As everyone else pi** poor service I was sitting at home all day waiting for the package to arrive, they didnt ring the bell or knock on the door, no door knocker slip nothing, just a lazy ass driver that didn't want to get his ass out of the truck, he said he delivered at 4:19pm I was there I checked the tracking a minute later and tried to call purolator, on hold for 90 minutes before I gave up. I wouldn't send a pile of sh** through purolator, actually I should then not pick it up so they have to deal with the smell and dispose of it."

"I recently moved into a new apartment, so I ordered the needed things to furnish this apartment, in the past 3 days I have had 30 different parcels successfully arrive to my new shipping address with absolutely no issue and no delays, none of them handled by purolator.
This parcel for some reason was given to purolator to deliver to me.
This parcel was flagged as ""incomplete info/address"". despite the shipping address being the same exact for all of my other parcels, and me already receiving the rest of the parcels just fine.

I checked my email, they did not reach out to me at all, not even a automated email to try to warn me, I had to find this out through checking the tracking number, and was not scheduled for a re-delivery until I managed to make my way through the fake bot support agents and FAQ pages to finally reach a real person, and request another re-delivery, telling them that my mail is handled on the lobby floor.
and of course, its gonna be days until they try again. how did the delivery people even miss this? there is a massive wall of mailboxes with big parcels sitting in front of them, the first thing when you get inside the lobby."

"Unreliable at best.

Delivery driver in a major city with many, many high-rise apartments apparently can't figure out how to dial an apartment number on an entry pad. Seems to be a common theme amongst delivery drivers from different couriers. I'm guessing these drivers are just straight up not even attempting deliveries and giving some excuse as to why... such as customer not home or no entry code given. Since when have apartment buildings had entry codes? They have buzzers... connected to my phone. These drivers aren't even hiding their contempt for their job anymore. I would have preferred if they just gave a notification that they didn't have time to deliver on a certain day. Don't even get me started on using their online system to try and address the issue. Absolute disaster.

Canada Post may be slow with non-existent customer service, but they've never missed a delivery and they're cheap."

"Had a horrible experience with Purolator
During the pandemic
Purolator guy took off with my package even though I spoke to him from my balcony and told him I was going down to open the door I order to pick up my package
That had a impact on the delay of my package for another 3 to 4 days
I had to speak with a supervisor that insisted that the drivers have a few minutes to deliver and that's why the guy took off

Horrible service"

"The worst shipper ever
I shiped a very important papers and paid more so that it arrive on time and it didnt reach till now"
"2:57pm- “ Shipment delivered”
4:39pm- “Unable to deliver,Receiver closed”
4:57pm- “Address Correction required”
5:17pm- “Scheduled for delivery next business day”
10:47am-“on truck out for delivery”
10:11pm—-apparently still on truck out for delivery—- literally no other information.
Is this a joke?
No but Purolator is, that’s for sure. Why have my phone number on the shipping label and NOT USE IT? My street, my postal code has LITERALLY ONE SINGLE ADDRESS registered to it. No other, even if there was a typo in the address, which there wasn’t, Puro gives zero...ahem.. to even attempt to find the correct one. Horrible service. I contacted the shipper, they’re sending me a new order and investigating how they delivered my single package but still has it on their truck a day later. I’m contacting all my regular shippers and requesting no Purolator. Terrible."

Second time a delivery has to be picked up after the day it was supposed to be delivered because they don’t make the effort to properly call me through the intercom in my building and say i was not available.

We placed a pick up with Purolator last Wednesday ..for the past few days it was showing the package arrived in Mississauga..when we called the customer service we were informed that there is no information abt the package in their system from last few days and somebody will contact us within 24 to 48 hrs... extremely disappointed with the service...Canada Post was much much better..if there was a zero rating I would give that....The package contains a very important natural medication which I have been waiting...Now I am not sure I will ever receive it

"This is the worst shipping experience I ever had.
I order a computer part off amazon and I pay express because my computer is fried and I need that part to be able to work. Keep in mind as a self employed entrepreneur in a pandemic, work is very scarce and I can't effort to miss deadlines and lose contracts.

My delivery was scheduled for tuesday morning. Around noon I get an email telling me my package couldnt be delivered because my street is closed. My street is NOT closed. I got a package from intelcom and from canada post the very same morning. But there is construction on the corner so I understand it might be a little confusing (even tho every other delivery service never missed a delievery). So I call and explain the situation. The person understood and put a note to the driver and even left my phone number if he's confused. She GUARANTEED my delievery would be there in the morning.
Its kinda messing with my deadlines but its ok, I'll manage.

Day 2 around noon I get an email saying the same thing. I call again, explain again my street is NOT closed. The person called dispatch and GUARANTEED the truck would come back around 3pm.
3pm...nothing.
I call again (keep in mind its 45min on hold everytime you call). The person told me the driver is late and GUARANTEED he would be there before 6pm.
6pm...nothing.
I call again. Now they transfer me to a superior. Very nice lady, she understand that the driver is an idiot and have no respect for his job or the clients. She said I could pickup the package at distribution center. I drive 30min over there only to be told the package is in the truck and they cant give it to me.
I call back the supervisor and she GUARANTEED the package would be there first thing in the morning. I even get an email saying the resolved the issue with the driver.

This morning, I get an email at noon telling me the driver can't access my street...I call again, this time I speak with a super arrogant supervisor who tells me that my adress is not good and he can't do anything for me, that im not allowed to come pick it up and that I need to contact the sender and hangs up.
I call the sender its a full voicemail. I can't do anything.
Later the same lady as the day before calls me and tell me that the other supervisor was basicly telling bullsht to get rid of me and that I needed to come pickup my package at the distribution center before the curfew at 8pm.
So drove another hour to pick up my package.

I spent more than 4.5hrs waiting on the phone, had to drive for 2hrs, ended up losing a contract because I couldn't meet the deadline...and I couldn't get a refund for my shipping.

Do yourself a favor and never ever deal with Purolator."

Not a cloud in the sky from here to where there package is being shipped, yet is being delayed for “extreme weather”. By extreme they must mean too nice a day to work. Wow . Huge fail purolator ... again"
"For 2 days now my parcels have been out for delivery... End of the day, I get a message saying... Weather delay... I seen them in town the last 2 days doing deliveries. I wish that Amazon wouldn't use them and stick to Canada Post. For the last 2 months, it's happening more times then actually delivering the parcel. I am not the only one here in this town either.

It would be appreciated if companies would stop using this courier. Purolator is the only one that fails to deliver on time or even at all. 90% of the time the address is not read correctly or there was no actual attempt made to ring the buzzer. So basically I paid $30+ to receive added stress in my life rather then 1-2day delivery

Amazon should reconsider using their services"

"I'll start off by saying I ordered a monitor from Dell and I have no clue why they use Purolator but whatever, the package is suppose to arrive on Tuesday, I check the tracking around 12 and it says package is delayed. On Wednesday I get my monitor but the box looks like the driver ran over it with his truck. Sometimes I wonder if the drivers just go to the back and start stomping on all the packages cause their is no explanation to why my monitor box looks like its been through World War II. Now I'm praying to God that they haven't cracked my monitor screen and thank goodness they didn't otherwise I would've made a personal visit to their headquarters and taken a fat dump right in the lobby, what an absolutely dog company"

"My package that was supposed to be delivered by Purolator never arrived. The tracking status said that there were delivery attempted but this was never the case. I have a camera on my front door and despite ""delivery attempt made"" this was not the case at all. They redelivered on a different date and I was waiting for it and same thing happened--no delivery made even though website said they attempted to deliver. It's been over 2.5 weeks and this service is disappointing. Now I have to see if I can pick it up. I never had any issues with Fedex or Canada Post. Will definitely not recommend Purolator as a courier service."

"Probably the most useless and incompetent delivery service you can never count on to deliver inside of Canada. I truly have not had a good experience with Purolator and they've never been on time. They don't update tracking, they delay packages for no reason, and don't provide any decent customer service for when one of their parcels inevitably doesn't arrive on time. And honestly I feel like the purolator drivers use my packages as a punching bag as they're always mangled. Purolator needs to seriously get their act together and start providing adequate logistical services to their customers. I wish I could choose who carried my package when ordering on Amazon, id pay money to not have Purolator touch it.

You're honestly better off trying to throw your package from the place of origin to the place of destination than to ship it through purolator; the thrown package would probably arrive sooner and in better condition."

"Tracking my package of paints the tracking stopped at Peterborough. I live in Bancroft, for days the package didn't show up here. It was expected on the 18 and yesterday I found it behind a snow shovel on my deck. Not knowing the paints had made it to Bancroft I just assumed they were lost. I don't know how long they were sitting on my deck maybe a couple of days. Purolater should be sending out updates so you know when and where the package was put especially during covid when you can't be in contact with the delivery guy. Package could freeze this time of year. Other couriers give you the option of texting or emailing you to tell you it is on the way and that it is delivered, some even say where it was put, like garage, backdoor etc. On the Purolator site it won't let you set that up unless you are a business. In my tracking it still says Peterborough 😳"

"Please stop using Purolator. Every time I've used this company it has been a disaster. Two examples. First, needed a Visa and paid for next day service. Purolator didn't deliver until 3 DAYS later! I then complained and got the typical canned response: ""we're so sorry blah blah. Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to help"". An apology isn't helpful and you can do what you were paid to do for the service you contracted for. Swore to never use them again. But companies keep using them to deliver. So next example, bought some items off newegg. Paid for 3 day service. Took eleven days!! They managed to be SLOWER than regular post! How is that possible?! Then, instead of delivering the pkg, they left a door knocker saying I wasn't home. I work from home! I was waiting! So I needed to drive to the warehouse in nowhereland to get it. This company is worse that useless, they are going to cost you. Do not use them.

EDIT - And there it is!!! The BS no help reply made to my post one day after. Nothing helpful offered. Just a garbage canned reply to keep their statistics up, making it look as if they actually respond to customer concerns. Take note! This should tell you all that you need to know about this company."

Again... I would concur with most of the reviews here. Terrible!
They have a package sent with a gift I purchased for my son, the address I’ve used for years to send him gifts via various couriers. But this company cannot find my sons address and trying to get it resolved is infuriating, no one gets back to you. The ‘chat’ facility is computer generated and you can not speak to anyone.

I called many times and requested just find out the truck location so I can go and pick my packages. I have very important documents and required for my travel. But they have same reply all the time, they are working on that.

They are not able to find truck it means they lost my packages. Such a big liars."

"This is Purolator's most frequent answer: We're sorry if we disappointed you and we apologize for the inconvenience. Rather just say ""we don't care"".
Every of my shipments' late or has been delivered to a wrong address, no exception. I am not angry at the drivers, the standard is 11 delivery stops per hour. Really, is that reasonable???
Stinking management."
"It seems Purolator (Nepean, Ottawa) is just delivering slips saying they missed you and asking customers to go to a brunch far away to pick the package up. I have been working from home all day long and cannot miss anyone knocking the door or ring the bell. I spent 50 minutes calling the customer service and they arranged a re-delivery but another slip of paper was secretly delivered to the door. Unfortunately, I do not have a camera that records how they deliver the slip instead of the package. But according to many complaints, such practice is being done by Purolator too often."

"Second time an order is delivered by them, second time it fail to reach, no knock at the apartment door, no text, just a slip asking me to go pick up my item at an hour where I CLEARLY WORK. I often require headphone to do my job and cant hear a knock , especially if they don't ring the bell of the apartment block, or bother coming down to my personal door to knock rather then knock a full floor above me at main door."

"I routinely get deliveries to my house from UPS, Canpar, Fedex, Canada Post and Purolator. For some reason, Purolator is the only one to consistently have problems delivering. Usually it goes to one of my neighbors (there are 5 houses on my street, next to the highway) and I have to watch until Purolator tracking says 'delivered', then I go around the houses looking for it. Today was different - the delivery was 'Out for Delivery' yesterday, but was 'Delayed in transit due to disruption'. Today it was out for delivery again, but this time they dumped it at some pickup counter in another town, and I will have to go and get it within 5 days. Looking back over the last year, all the couriers have done ok except Purolator, which is averaging 5 in 10 deliveries to my house go to the wrong address."

"Very unprofessional and delivery not to standards.
Contacted customer service it a forever wait to get through, I specified that a phone call needs to be placed in order to get access to my floor. I was told no, that it is part of the delivery and they do not call.
The notice for my parcel was left at the front door of the building stating the time of delivery, which I was at home through the whole time. My neighbor picked up the notice and handed to me an hour and half later.
Other delivery service have no problem calling, giving a estimate time of parcel arrival and even emails are sent out throughout the process of delivery.
Customer satisfaction and quality of service is very essential to any company.
Not impress with Purolator!
Purolator needs to focus on customer satisfaction and update their way of delivery."

"I am a disabled senior who depends on delivery services.
An Amazon order was to be delivered but I got the ""inaccessible"" BS in an email.
My building manager has been locking the outside door since the weather got cold due to a homeless problem in my area.
EVERY other delivery service has used my telephone number PLAINLY on the shipping label to call so I can go out to open the outside door for them and receive my delivery. I rebooked the delivery and left the message about phoning me on their useless automated system.
Purolator, on the other hand, does not allow their drivers to carry cell phones ( ??? - what do they do in an emergency, send up ()&$&*&% flares? ) due to ""security reasons"". I received that information on their chat line with a live person - after going through a bunch of garbage to get to a human being.
So - they dropped my package off at a pickup location. I am disabled - I don't drive and in these Covid times do not want to ask a friend to put their health in danger.
Could the driver not contact their dispatch (surely they are in some kind of contact with dispatch) to have THEM call me so I could open the door? Apparently not.
Next time I see a Purolator delivery coming I will cancel/refuse the delivery.
CUSTOMER SERVICE??? I think not."

"Despite all the difficulties I have experienced in relation to my package delivery, as well as the inconsistent information provided by Purolator CSRs, and Supervisors. I must say, when I was transferred to Tammy, one of Purolator supervisors, she was welcoming, warm and amazing; as a result, I just want to take the time out to update my experience with her since Monday, February 15, 2021.

Tammy was a game changer from the get go. The moment I spoke with her I felt relief but cautious at the same time because I was constantly being misinform by Purolator staffs. Notwithstanding, Tammy took the time to listen and showed empathy throughout our entire conversation. She looked at her system then asked me a few questions to which she paragraph my answers to ascertained the information. She told me that the depo was close due to Family day in Canada but she will send an email to the depo and follow up with me as soon as she receive a respond from them and guarantee that I will receive my package on Wednesday, February 17, 2021.

On Tuesday, February 16, 2021, I emailed James, social mediate coordinator who replied that Tammy was working on it. About 12:01pm that same day I missed a call from Tammy, she left a detail message on my voicemail, after listening I immediately returned her call. Once again she showed compassion and assured me that I will receive the package on Wednesday then verified my personal details for the driver to have.

On Wednesday, February 17, 2021, I received a telephone called from Purolator driver stating that he was here, I immediately rushed downstairs to get my package, the driver told me you don't need to rush we exchange a few conversations, he was very polite.

I just want to thank Tammy for being so compassionate, for showing empathy, being transparent and efficient. Thank you for going above and beyond. You walk me through the process, you called and updated me along the way even the very day of the delivery. Keep up the good work!

You're amazing!"

"Ordered an item from a seller with next day delivery and I have now been waiting around three days with no tracking updates and no one will tell my where my package is. Last update says it was in Montreal but that was 3 days ago and they just won't deliver my god damn package. This happens over and over and over again with Purolator. I do not know why sellers continue to use them, they are by far the worst carrier in Canada. They deserve to go bankrupt with their criminally poor service."

"How does this company even survive with such a terrible customer service. Purolator should be rated the worst company (carrier) in the whole world. I always request my sellers not to ship through Purolator as they always lie. Driver never show up and leave no labels. When you track your package it says ""undeliverable as customer unavailable"". You call their customer service and they ask you to pick it up from some locations. Why am I paying the shipping charges then."

"its a hit and miss. some days they would say you don't have a buzzer code, when in fact there is always a list of buzzer codes in almost every residential building. some days they will say attempted deliver receiver unavailable when on that aforementioned time, there was no calls received announcing somebody in your door. The chat option is not working as well. tsk tsk. not too reliable.

addendum:
wasted my days off waiting for a package that never came. No notice, no buzz. lots of excuses. Customer service is just thru social media. you can event talk to a real person. I d rather avoid them if possible. It saves you the stress and the agony of waiting."

"Had to write my second review, for a package expected on January 28th.... it is now February 16th and i still haven’t received it... who’s to say when i will either. I’ve requested them to just hold it for pickup whenever it gets back to their depot instead, but i’ve also done that before and they literally blatantly ignored it and attempted to deliver anyways. I just want to show when it sat in there sorting facility for 8+ days when it was already 5-7 days late from the initial date of the 28th

Wed. Feb. 10, 2021 - 4:19 p.m. TORONTO (EAST/EST), ON Unable to deliver - delivery date rescheduled
Wed. Feb. 3, 2021 - 3:31 p.m. MISSISSAUGA (WEST/OUEST), ON Arrived at sort facility
Tue. Feb. 2, 2021 - 10:41 a.m. TORONTO (EAST/EST), ON Shipment transferred to authorized agent
Tue. Feb. 2, 2021 - 12:10 a.m. TORONTO (EAST/EST), ON

From February 2nd to February 19th nothing basically happened with my package, and i requested to pick it up from before that on the phone with a CRP and it’s like they just completely ignored it and took my package to Mississauga. I am currently in contact with a tracing specialist and they apparently got an incorrect address with attempting to deliver it on the 14th, but when asked to update it they read out the same address i was about to give them... no errors, nothing... so now i’m basically waiting for that driver to bring my package back to the depot and hopefully not ignore my request to pick it up cause i don’t even care to deal with this company"
Save yourself a stressful experience and do not buy anything through Best Buy with Purolator delivery. It’s unrealistic for purolator to use Covid as an excuse for delayed deliveries a year after the pandemic. There is no assurance or guarantee that you’ll receive your order in time. They keep pushing the delivery day by day and each customer service rep promises a new delivery date. Purolator is unable to deliver. Makes sense that 90% of their reviews are one star.

"Ordered a mattress on Amazon Prime, with an estimated delivery date of 1-2 days. It was to be delivered from Woodbridge to downtown Toronto, a 35 minute journey.

It took Purolator TWO WEEKS, and only after I contacted customer service multiple times. They refused to do anything until 10 days had passed and I pointed out it had just been sitting in the sort facility about 10 minutes from its final destination for over a week. God knows how long it would have taken if I hadn't explained to them repeatedly how to do their job.

AVOID if at all possible. And Amazon, please stop using this garbage company or you will start losing customers."

"A 2nd day delivery from Canada to Europe has taken a week and it has NOT been delivered yet. No excuse. No refund. If you need reliable service there is only FEDEX, Maybe UPS. Don’t gamble with Purolator or DHL. Don’t get me going on DHL....."
"This company and service is terrible. After waiting for a pair of shoes that I had ordered, the tracking software said “delivered” but my package never arrived and I was home all day waiting for it. After calling Purolator, I was told that the gps signal reflected that the truck was close to my house and that they couldn’t do anything about the missing package and then continued to blame my neighbours for potentially ‘stealing’ my package. Four days later, my package showed up on my front steps, the plastic was ripped apart and the box was torn into pieces and had tape all over it. Someone had clearly gone through my package and then tried to tape it but did a terrible job. It looked like it got ran over and went through a shredder. I do not trust this company and would NOT recommend to anyone. Will be avoiding shipment from them at all costs."

"I paid an extra $20 for expedited shipping. The purolator delivery personnel claimed they ‘attempted’ delivery 2 times (while everyone was home) and didn’t even leave a notice of attempted delivery. I called the customer service twice. The first time they told me my package was in a facility in Langley and that I should attempt to pick it up. They told me they wouldn’t send my package until Wednesday (today is Saturday), far later than I paid for. The second time I called they told me my package would not be ready even if I went for pickup, and it wouldn’t be ready until Tuesday. I asked for an email or phone number for the facility but they told me there was none and even if they had one, they wouldn’t bother answering anyway because they’re too busy. Never use these guys for anything that is time sensitive.

EDIT: I was contacted by purolator and able to locate my package for pick up. Thank you."

"Worst service ever. They were supposed to deliver a package that I bought at BestBuy. They never called me and didn’t want to leave the package with the building concierge. They left a paper with the wrong address for pick up. My package is now in a different delivery centre from the address and 1-hour away from my home address and I am supposed to go there and pick up. This is the worst service you can get. Completely useless. Also, they don’t have any customer service available on Saturdays and the virtual assistance platform is even more useless.

I purchased a TV from Amazon with prime guaranteed delivery within 2 days yet Purolator already crossed that timeline. And on contacting their customer service via lengthy chat process and unanswered phone calls, an agent confirmed to me delivery on same day on the 3rd day. An hour later, I find that my shipment status has been amended to reflect expected delay of 4-7 days due to being oversized shipment!!! You can't deliver a 50'' TV in 2-3 days? why are you in business to start with then!!!! such a failure of a company."

"First package that was sent to me was lost by Purolator. No updates, no notifications, nothing. Every day, Just looks like it will arrive by 8pm that day.

Second replacement package actually gets routed through Purolator's system - but instead of the 2 days that its supposed to come in, no notification and guess what, doesn't arrive on day 3. However, on day 3, I learn that there is an either 2-3 day delay due to the pandemic or a 4-7 day delay due to the package size. so what is it? 2-3? 4-7? or is it (2-3) + (4-7)? Am I just supposed to sit around everyday and wait for a package all day from day 2 to day 10? Seriously pathetic. I get there are complications due to distancing and C19; however, this service is appalling.

go with any other service provider."

This time, I had to wait 7 days just for my item to be put on a truck, and that WHOLE day I was home, but the driver decided he didn't feel like delivering my package to me so they said there was an address issue, saying I didn't provide my buzzer number, which is TOTALLY UNTRUE.

"Ugh so upset with this company I mean seriously can your drivers actually attempt to even come to my address at all???

I ordered a package a few weeks ago and when it went out for delivery it said that I wasn't available...I am home Monday yo Friday until 5pm at least only leave to go grocery shopping because I'm not working and my hubby is, we only have one car, I don't take public transportation due to the pandemic so everything has to wait until my hubby gets home from work so I can use the car..so i was I fact home on a Monday morning lier.

I called talked to the most unpleasant customer service person ever and she said it was missing a buzzer number...lies again... I triple checked I put it in there because I have worked in shipping and know how important the entry codes are but whatever!!

then she gave me some BS story of how it would be marked to reattempt but they could tell me when because of the pandemic...not even a rough idea come on people...I waited 5 business days still no package so a caved and went to pick up my package (which had my buzzer number typed on the OG label clear as day) and the lady at the counter was like ""oh good thing you came in today it was marked to be returned to sender tomorrow because it's out of hold days""...no phone calls no nothing. What happened to my reattempted???

then my amazon package told me it was coming via them...guess what??? I had to pick that up too because apparently now my address doesn't exist...I don't live in a new building or on a new street ether and the address shows up in Google maps and you were allegedly able to find it with the first package so I say...YOU ARE JUST TO LAZY TO DELIVER MY PACKAGE...and your customer service is crap. They all sound like they hate their jobs that they don't even do apparently."

"The company takes no ownership of lost packages, they don't care. All they need is a gps reading and other than that the package themselves does not have to make it to you and you will not get anywhere with it.

The responsibility is thrown into the shipper. Don't use, ever. The delivery company does not promise to actually deliver your items, you would have better luck asking an average joe to do anything.

Don't send me to your customer service that has already told me off. Additionally, I forwarded all emails and corespondence with your customer ""support"" and the shipper company is now committed to no longer use purlator services. I hope that the damage the company took financial is worth your lack of accountability and responsibility."

"Over the last couple of years I have had items returned to sellers on ebay etc with no reason given as to why items was returned just a refund. Today I have reason to believe this may have happened due to Purolator not giving me a phone call or email to let me know item has arrived. Currently this is the 10th day of Feb and I see an item has been sitting at the Fort St. John Depo since Feb 5 with no phone call to let me know item has arrived, they only keep items 5 days then send them back. I think it would be common courtesy to let the customer know when their order is in. Well today Feb 11 I went in to pick up my parcel and turned out there were 2 sitting there about to be sent back with no phone call given to me for either. This is not performance. Tracking details
Pitney Bowes Tracking ID: PBXSA008156385, with phone number clearly visible by my address, 2nd item Purolator pin: 332713943055, also clearly shows my phone number just to the right and below my address. I don't own a cell phone but do have an email address and a land line. In follow up with them their reasoning was that only 2 digits of phone number were available to their employees, however my full phone number is clearly visible on both. It makes sense that when items are shipped to a shipping address that would be the shipping address to be used. Therefore before a shipping company takes on parcels from USPS they would ensure that all of a phone number is visible before they would take on the responsibility of handling the package and that they don't cover up vital delivery info like phone numbers with their own label before ensuring that info is on their label, better yet, let Canada post deliver it since that is Canada's equivalent to USPS."

"Terrible service, impossible to get an accurate response from them. My urgently needed shipment is already 7 days late, and Ive been told that it wont be another 7 days due to special handling requirements. It has been sitting in their Toronto warehouse for almost 6 days without budging. It has created a lot of inconvenience for me, and my project. Would give them a minus review if I could."

Missed delivery 2 days in a row now because the driver never even tried to knock on our door. I was up since 6am waiting for the package only to get a missed delivery notice at 8 after no attempts to actually deliver. On hold with customer service now for 30 mins with no sign of getting any help and on top of everything my package isn’t even available for pick up so I have no choice but to wait. Extremely unprofessional and borderline unlawful. If it was a bigger order I would be considering talking to a lawyer about the legality behind being able to do this.
"Would not recommend!

I checked my tacking history wondering were was my package (Iphone) and it said that someone tried to deliver my package and that it was sent at the wrong address. I checked with someone from Customer Services afterward to confirm the address they had and it's the right one !! My package spent days a Purolator and no one tried to contact me to talk to me about the address issue (that in the end, wasn't an issue since it was the right address).

The Customer Service person told me they couldn't do anything to know where is my package now, so in other term, it feels like they lost it or maybe the delivery person faked to deliver my package to keep it, since I was there at the time of the ""delivery"".

Very weird situation and disappointed about their Customer Services."

"I can't believe the company hasn't gone out of business yet. Why should they be graded for customer service? They have no service at all! The delivery man's attitude is terrible, lazy and awful.
They usually ring your doorbell and then leave right away without a phone call. When I went downstairs, the Courier had just left my door, I said hello to him and wanted to get my delivery, but he looked at me and then walked straight away. My roommate couldn't believe what I was going through."

I was at home waiting for my order and after 1 hour when I check status again it was saying receiver unavailable like seriously I don’t receive any call I was at home no one comes.

PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY"
"I do a lot of online shopping both for personal and business going on over 6 years now.
Of course Covid has had a terrible inpact on receiving supplies which may out of stock and the delays.
However even before the pandemic Purolator has more often than not been quite inefficient regarding deliveries.
A few times my orders were in the wrong truck, delivered to my neighbour causing a lot of stress.
I deal mostly with Amazon and have asked them to use another shipping company.
They did this and guess what......never a delivery problem.
Now when I see Purolator on the delivery notice I prepare myself for some sort of problem.
Used to be a great reliable service but now Purolator is not good at all.
Sorry but the service is rotten.
Glad I was able to vent......"

"Every apartment building has a mail room ro recieve packages when people aren't home. Almost always this mail room requires asking the front desk for access. Over the last several shipments I've ordered that were shipped through purolator (not by my choice) this is just way too difficult for their drivers to figure out. After pulling up in front of the building, looking at the doors and immediately giving up, they send my package to the absolute farthest away location for me to pick it up. There is a purolator store not 15 minutes walk from my building, but I have to bus for an hour and a half one-way to pick up my packages. Every. Freaking. Time. This is the laziest, most disorganized, crappy shipping company out there. That they haven't failed and gone bankrupt is truely astounding. I hate getting packages through them so much I might have to stop ordering from my favourite store because I know they'll ship with these clowns."

Other wise, I have same issues, I wish we had a choice who to ship with as I would have paid more for better service. Yes my item is very large TV, but there should be something setup that if a shipping company is behind or cannot handle large shipment, that the system would jump to one of the other competitors. If your owned by Canada Post and have a history of poor shipping, this is what will destroy your business because your infrastructure is not made to handle high volumes??? It's been a full year since covid and you guys had lots of time to vamp up to keep up with demand! We pay for Prime & and other shipping fees for a reason.

Two days for a package to travel from downtown Vancouver to Burnaby, and I still haven't received it. Waited for 30 minutes on the the phone for someone to tell me it's on the truck and they deliver up to 8 pm...... THEY CLOSE AT 730!!!!!!

"Avoid using Purolator during pandemic times (and likely altogether) if you need your package in a timely manner - a default 4 to 7 business day hold will very likely be placed on your package if it's anything other than a small mailer. As you can see from other folks' reviews, this delay is likely to be significantly longer. No other carrier has imposed these sorts of delays on any shipment of mine, particularly in-province, even during the peak of pandemic situation. The typical response of 'we are prioritizing medical and express deliveries' will be given, with only the offer to open a trace if it exceeds. I will avoid using the service for personal and business use moving forward."

"I would've preferred to give no stars.

Absolutely atrocious company with no regard or respect for its customers. Simple tv delivery has been tried to be delivered three times now, the latest encounter was a 'recipient unavailable' moment, even though I was home. Moving from Europe here lately, a Co like this would never exist back home or be allowed to treat customers this way. I think the worst part is reputable companies like Amazon, Best Buy etc who delegate delivery responsibilities to 'companies' such as this one... Assuming they probably undercut every other courier to the contract and balance this on their end with a crappy, cheap and disorganized service.

I kept checking the tracker so I wouldn’t miss the delivery but I eventually found out that the delivery truck did pass by my apartment building only to leave a “we missed you” slip. No phone call or anything and I was home the whole day, as most people since it’s a pandemic, so there really isn’t any excuse as to how I have to go out and get my package from a pick up location when I opted for a service that delivers packages straight to your house.

Christmas was hard enough and then to add this on made it over the top.
They put out a search and said they couldn't find it. On top of that they said they do not take any responsibility.
The agent w used said they should repay cost of delivery plus $100.00.

"It took 5 days for the shipment to arrive from Vancouver to Toronto. The package has been sitting at a sorting facility in Toronto for almost 3 weeks now. Ironically, the facility is only a couple of km from my house. However, I can't go there because the item hasn't been sorted yet.

Update:
Tracing investigating was opened on Feb 3rd. We exchanged some info throughout the week. On Feb 10th, I was told to contact the sender. The package could not be located and the case was closed. It is unfortunate that in this day and age, Purolator is struggling with on time deliveries and lost packages."

"""Delivery rescheduled due to missed delivery"" even though I was actually home all day and could not possibly have missed the delivery and the second day it was not even on vehicle for delivery.

Attempted to call to get some answers and hold at the station for pick up locally but the hold time was longer than 45 minutes and then they disconnected me while on hold. It's almost like they are avoiding dealing with people and potential problems on purpose. You also do not have the option to hold at local location on their site. Their tracking is also significantly worse than the other couriers.

Out of all courier services active in Canada right now Purolator is by far the worst, even worse than Canada Post (yeah I know, didn't think it was possible). If you can choose any other service it is in your best interest to do so."
"Hi Henry,

Thank you for this review. We apologize for the inconveniences. Missed delivery means that we were unable to make an attempt, most of the time, due to extremely high volumes.

"Delayed 2-3 days because of pandemic and 4-7 days because the package was oversize. I have lived in three cities across Ontario and in all three Purolator has been far and away the worst delivery service of the several available (CanPost, Fedex, UPS, etc.). If you want some insight into how they respond to criticism, take a look at the customer service responses below--boilerplate responses that offer no new information, no attempt to solve the particular problem, no assurance that Purolator will improve."

Called their customer services and the lady on the phone told me that the driver was not able pick it and the will delivery next week.
Advice them that I took the day off today because I’ve been advise by them that it will be delivery today, she just keep saying well story but is nothing that we can do.
Now I have to tak Monday off as well hopping that this time they will show up.
Horrible custom service. Hope that Best Buy stops choosing them as their delivery company."

Had amazing experience a few years ago while working for Executive Furniture Rentals. Currently unemployed and the residential delivery service is awful.

"This was my first time using purolator. And will be my last time!! I ordered some delicate Christmas snow village items from a shop in Ontario. I am in Manitoba. I watched the tracking of my package. Picked up on January 7th. Went to two different sort facilities in Ontario the same day. Now in transit to Manitoba. I was thinking YAY this is going to come quickly. NOT!!
January 12th arrives in Manitoba. So I wait and wait and wait some more for an update. Finally the 18th (six days later) I do the chat with a rep..oh not sure why it hasn't been updated. Wait another two days and then finally see its scheduled for delivery the next day. Next day comes...I get notification its on the truck and on the way to me. Few hours later I get another notification saying address is not in delivery service area. I am rural about 40 minutes from city. What? So call them, nope don't deliver to me. I said okay drop it at my daughters (in the city) Ask for her postal code...nope not there either. Pardon me?? I ask ok where is nearest pick up point for me then? Then I am told a town that is about 1/2 hr from me (which is fine) I did say soooo you are going to come from the city and go right past me to get to that other town. I said you do realize that town is farther from the city than I am? Oh really? So fine. Thats the package destination. I wait and wait a few more days. Chat again on January 25th...whats the hold up? It was on a truck before, now where is it. Not sure I am told. OMG...put it somewhere and I will pick it up myself from the city facility. Ok but that won't be available today! Ok tomorrow then?? Tracing specialist (ya ok) will call you, I will let them know you will pick up. Two more days go by, hear nothing! This morning get a notification that it is on the truck for delivery. Ummm delivery to where??? To me...to the other little town, to the facility in the city?? Again get on the chat to see where it is going. Last entry was for the little town....ok then. Finally makes it there, and I drove 1/2 hr to pick up. Its sad really because I plan on ordering from that shop in Ontario alot, they lost a potential repeat customer. I will not deal with them again. Only five days to get from one province to another...and then two weeks to get to me, or should I say for me to get to it, since it was dropped nowhere near convenient for me."

I and my family had a lot of bad experience with them. One time they deliver my packet in the wrong building. The other time, they placed my wife's packet outside of the building and it got lost.

How is this company still in business? They arrive 2 days before the day indicated by the retailer. I can't get through to their customer service - 25 min and holding.

"I was supposed to get an email with shipping details for a modem I was sent. Never got it. Only found it out after I called the telecom company.

Turns out Purolator had not knocked on my door (I was in) and instead walked through my side gate into my back yard and left a package that clearly says is a modem outside in the rain for 2 days. All they did was lodge a service complaint, like that makes up for the days' work I'll lose due to not having internet.

I've had negative experiences with them before. The other company used them, though, so I had no choice in it. This is the worst example of their terribleness. I'd give them 0 stars if I could."

"Purolator's customer service representatives are the best. Purolator's deliverers have to be the most brain dead individuals I have ever encountered. What are the requirements to get the job? What is the hiring process? My package was supposed to arrive on the 21st. They said the driver claimed the address was invalid, I called in, the agent said it was their mistake and that the address was valid all along. He also said they wont be able to deliver it the next day, so I had to wait that day and the weekends. It's now the following monday and tracking information is still saying address correction required. I called in and was told that the request was not viewed yet, and that I'll have to wait for tomorrow."

Purolator Courier may have cost me quite a bit of money because they decided to deliver a package to someone that was not me on Thursday afternoon shortly after 4:30pm. I was home and they did not buzz my apartment number and it contained a very expensive item. I am livid to say the least. They were not so supposed to redeliver anyways as they tried on Wednesday when I was not home and left me a pick up slip with the location. I went to the location on Thursday (On the slip it said anytime after 9:00am and I went around 3:00pm) to be told it was not there but at a different location. I went to that other location and the same thing. I tried to call and I could not get through. I did not even know that it was delivered until I checked online. I feel victimized and violated by this experience and I am very vocal about it. I have been contacted by someone in the company who is looking into it. This review will stay as is in the meantime unless there is a miracle.

"Don't ever use this company for anything at all, I don't know why Purolator still exists. I have lived in many countries and used all kinds of mail, this is by far the worst mail company I have dealt with in the entire world.

I have ordered critical items like a furniture for work, my bed, and they give an initial delivery date and once failed to meet that they will update with a ""2-3 days late"" late message. Might as well put 2-3 years and hope you forget! It has been WEEKS for multiple packages and nothing. I call them and all they tell me is to wait another 2-3 days. They also say they won't check on the item because they ""can't"". I have still not received my items, these items together are worth about $2000. As business owner, I have instructed all the businesses and contacts I work with to also stop using Purolator."

"The story starts on December 30, when I ordered 7 computer parts from Newegg. 1 arrived via UPS with no problem at all at my door, 4 arrived at a Purolator point after 10 day and 4 Purolator contacts.
2 still remain hostage at the depot in Winnipeg. In the meantime the computer company has opened a claim and Purolator has tried to deliver, but the put the parcels on wrong trucks, for 2 days now and now we are back at the starting point, where they do not know our address..."
"I had never ever received a package at my place with Purolator. Today, I had a package supposed to come to my place. Knowing what was coming, I had signed up on their website, logged in and updated my profile so my signature wasn't needed to deliver the parcel.
Now, okay, I don't have a buzzer at my apartment as I recently moved. No matter that, I never ever had a single problem with any delivers. I had even put a note for the driver with a note saying: ""My buzzer DOESN'T work, please call at... "" and my phone number there.
Regardless all of this I got a message saying that they had missed me and the parcel had been sent to who knows where.
The only positive thing, is for the person that attended me via phone. She was competent and at least sent the package to the closest destination possible to my place."

"This is the fifth time they cannot deliver to me, yet I've watched them drive past my house. They have even been unable deliver the package to my workplace, yet it is off a major highway.
The biggest problem with the organization Purolator is that you cannot contact the local office to pick it up. I am not sure where the package is because I'm talking to a human somewhere in some city in some country, not a local company. I like to buy local because of this issue, but could not buy the product.
I live 30min. away and just want to pick up my package. I would not recommend shipping with Purolator. I would recommend some other carrier. I have had nothing but fast an reliable service."

"Such pathetic service. I ordered from Hudson’s bay on January 2nd and the delivery date was January 7th. On January 6th, the status updated that the shipment will be delayed by 4-7 days because the shipment is oversized. I call the customer service on 4th day and they said to wait till 7th day. I called the customer service again on day 7 and they said they’ll need to trace the package and don’t know where is it. No update till today even after tracing request. They asked me for description of the product and I provided them within 2 hrs but still nothing. This is the worst service one can imagine. I’m not sure if I’m ever going to receive my shipment. Lost all hope."
"Hello Supreet,

Thank you for this review. We're sorry for the inconveniences. Due to extremely high volumes, the delivery of heavy/oversize shipments can take more time. If you can please email us the tracking number, we'll verify the status of the trace case for you.

The worst customer service experience. My package is showing as reached sort facility on January 3rd .When I contacted customer service they only say they are investigating and will update you soon .this is happening for last two weeks. If I send couple of emails I will get vague reply like “ I am still working on your case and will keep you updated.” this is same reply I get every time.
"Hello Arya,

"How is this company still in business? Give up! You're not wanted throughout the world anymore.. considering 90+% of your ratings are a 1 star!
How can you afford to keep your company running if eventually everyone is going to boycott you? I will no longer use a service that ships with Purolator..
For example. Just past before Christmas and I understand that there is delays before a holiday season.. but the day after it snowed.. and then receive an email that delivery was attempted.. yet.. no footprints in the snow on the driveway and no card left.. the driver didn't even attempt to deliver my item. This is a crock of sheit.. give up Purolator.. what do you have to say for your company?"

"I ordered a fridge from a local Best Buy a month ago - and it still hasn't arrived. Purolater frequently stops tracking it and despite getting on the phone with the company, and even opening up an investigation, there has been no communication on the status of the package - the service reps write something different than what the tracking has said - and still no luck. I have waited A MONTH in order to have a fridge, and it still isn't here. Absolutely appalling and the worst delivery experience (or lack thereof) that I have ever seen."

Constant delays on a delivery to the point I cancelled the order. Do yourself a favor and tell Amazon you will never accept packages from Purolator. They will note your account and that will take care of that problem. If enough people do it Amazon will drop them like the pathetic company that they are.

"I am honestly appalled at the carelessness that goes into this company. I'm a university student, and unfortunately because of COVID, my textbooks were shipped to me. I was awake and at home when they 'delivered it', but they just left a sticker on my door without knocking or anything. I had to speak to 3 customer service people, and finally found that they had (2 hours later) delivered my $525 package of brand new textbooks to some random persons house!! I planned to spend the weekend reading and studying, getting assignments done, but it has been 2 days of checking and calling and still nothing. I am behind on important work and my $500+ package is at some random persons house. How hard is it to get a driver to pick it up and bring it to the right address? I can see exactly where it is and so can they. Terrible, terrible job Purolator. For sanity's sake, DO NOT ship with them if you can avoid it. This is unnecessary and avoidable stress."

"Purolator is trash. Ive been waiting for an important package and once it said out for delivery Ive been checking out the window and waiting by the door. I kept checking the tracking and door once it said out for delivery. No one ever came to my door but my tracking changed to attemped delivery. THEY NEVER EVEN CAME TO MY HOUSE.

The return trip to BestBuy is still sitting at Purolator. It has been over 6 weeks and until now I am still waiting for a credit.

"Ordered a TV and wall mount from Best Buy Dec.13. TV picked up by Purolator Dec 14 in North York, at sort facility Dec 15, Dec 17 delayed 4-7 days for oversized package, also delayed 2-3 days fo pandemic. No update on tracking since then. On line chat just let's you know it is delayed, same as tracking information I can look up. Now multiple phone calls (hours of wasted time on hold) and they still just tell me it is delayed. Finally get a phone call asking what the package was as the don't know where it is. It's been almost a month and the are now at least looking for it. I should have risked getting covid and drove the hour to the store that had stock or waited until now as my local store now has stock. UPS had the wall mount delivered from Quebec in 4 days. Looks great on the wall with no TV. - UPDATE -package finally received January 18th, 1 month 3 days after it was picked up from the store."

I gave the address to them 3 more times, didn't help. I spent 4.5 hours trying to reach them, talking to them, chatting with them, calling the expeditor company for help. Only thing that worked was requiring reimbursement from sender"
The only good part is their customer service employees are nice - my package was supposed to come on a Monday and they claim they tried to drop it off but couldn’t because I wasn’t home or something even though I was waiting for my package in the living room (where I can see my driveway and both doors) all day. Now they claim they can only drop it off by Friday even though I needed it by Monday. Ridiculous

"I have previously shipped a lot with purolator anytime there is an issue on their end (lost package, etc.) all of the labour to correct the issue is put on the shipper. Make a claim then they take ages to approve it once that's done you need to fill out an extremely convoluted form that asks for the same info over and over. This seem intentional difficult. There's no place to just put in your case number or auto fill info from your profile.

Since the pandemic started Shaw had to use purolator as a delivery service and they could not be worse at doing the one thing they’re meant to do.

I ordered something off amazon a few things and one which was being delivered by Purolator hahaha they said it was out for delivery on wednesday and here i am at another wednesday and they just dropped it off at some place an hour from me after countless emails to them i finally received a notice saying it was ready for pick up an hour from house. purolator dose not deliver anything where it is supposed to how they are still in business i will never know. I will never use them or buy anything from any company that is going to use purolator as a courier.

I have been waiting for packages from 3 different curriers over December. The one arrived on time and one arrived early.

Called them, got sassed out on the phone, and was told it would be a few days because people are dying. smh."

"Parcels are ALWAYS late with purolator. Seriously, there has not been a single time that a parcel has been delivered on time with them. Tracking is spotty at best. Poor customer support. Why bother ? I'm not sure how they're still in business when there are better and more reliable shipping options.

*Reply: I contacted your customer service personnel and gave them tracking info regarding my package. They literally told me nothing more than what was stated in the tracking app and could give me NO additional information about when it might arrive. It has been sitting in a depot here in Vancouver for almost a week ! Absolutely terrible service. I will NEVER ship with Purolator again, nor will I shop with retailers that use Purolator as their shipping method. If this parcel does not arrive this week, I am prepared to escalate the matter further"
"Poor service, I had a parcel from Amazon, delivered by Purolator, the driver called me to open the door. When I go downstairs to find my parcel at the lobby, I found my parcel with 2 other parcels I assumed those were for other apartments left outside of the building in the snow!!! too. so I took mine and the other parcels inside the building"
"I would like to give them 0 star but it doesn’t let me unfortunately, worst delivery company ever, I was never delivered my orders by them, I had to track it, seeing the same excuse as ever “Address Missing” and pick up my order at their location.
I really hate them. That’s too bad that I can’t select the delivery company when placing an order."
"If I could give less than 1 star I would.. The worst courier service on the planet. Destroyed my packages 2 seprate times and simply just disposed of it the 1st time. 2nd time my pakcge got lost and couldnt be found for over a week only for them to finally trace it and inform me that it was damaged and so would be sent back to me and so I had to go drop off the package myself. And these parcels were express (next day) within Toronto. With blanket apologies - avoid them at all costs.

Terrible!"
"Ordered a charger from Bestbuy and was told the item would be delivered the next day (sweet!). Everything went to plan until the driver knocked on my door...I opened the door and to my surprise there's no package or driver. I have never experienced something like this before in a span of 5 minutes this all played out! He came at 2:20, I called Purolator by 2:26 to figure out what just happened. To add insult to injury the agent asked if its possible he left it in the lobby of my building rather than come up ...After repeatedly explaining to her that he actually knocked my door and I answered🤔. I think the bigger question is where the hell did he go so fast?!"
"Wow...just wow!!!

I just received an item that was shipped on the 31st Oct 2020 from the USA to me here in Canada.

That's 70-days to ship an item that weighs 0.030lbs.

That's got to be a new record for bad service!"
"Most horrible experience ordering my package. The delivery guy came, didn’t call, nor knock. Now have been waiting almost three weeks for something that should have been 3 days. Not a cheap package neither. Never will use or go through Purolator again."
"I have a very bad experience every time I have a shipment with Purolator (at least 3 times so far). Such an unreliable customer service and also hardly reachable! Wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Actually, other companies do way better even during the pandemic. So the pandemic is not an excuse."
"The customer service at Purolator is just a joke. Ask them a question regarding delivery status, they basically repeat back what you can see on the tracking page with the tracking number. Both Rhonda and Suzie L I believe, waste of my time. I would never choose Purolator with these unhelpful customer service reps."
Doesn't even deserved any star. Purolator didn't even one single successful delivery in our apartment. They just leave the failed delivery note on the door every single time.
"Purolator is the worst company ever, Their drivers don't even know how to ring the buzzer and then a few minutes later you get the text message that we missed. I've never seen a company like that."
I was loving puralator When Danny was on my route but since they moved him to another route PURALATOR sucks. ☹️😫
"Purolator, drop off our boxes at the incorrect address, leaving it at the front door while no one was at home..how is that possible, can't they read properly the address they were given..what about leaving a slip to pick up at their nearest location..what happened to their tracking service.
Poor service, you dont deserve any credit.."
"I would put zero if i can.
They always mess up the address, and ive been on hold for an hour and a half.
Truly terrible"
"If you enjoy tracking late/undelivered parcels or having to drive to your local purolator depot to retrieve your packages, this is the courier for you.
Any/every other courier is better."
"Shop app tells me a delivery was ""attempted"" but they couldn't find my address? I find that funny because I have an Amazon package that also came today and they managed to find my address just fine, the address was entered the same in both deliveries. The cherry on top was I called Puralator and was left on hold waiting for a customer service FOR ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR OF LISTENING TO THE SAME SONG OVER AND OVER. And then it hung up on me before I could even be transfered to someone that could help me. Amazing"
Worst shipping company ever. Peloton sent me my accessories and used Purolator as the delivery company. My accessories have been sitting at the sort facility 20 mins from my house for the last two weeks since December 24. I know there are shipping delays but this is unacceptable. No help whatsoever.
Im a small business owner with who got Royally screwed by purlator. In a span of 4 days they lost 4 packages totally 15 orders for $2000. Never ever drop anything in their dropbox they lost at least 6 packages last year and when it comes to making a claim they hide behind there was no scan when it is their drivers who are the ones not scanning the packages they picked up. Im not crazy i know i dropped off every package that i did because my livelihood depends on iy! Now their telling me their no evidence i dropped of the packages when they fully told me they were backlogged for scanning packages over the Christmas break. Never ever again!!! Worse shipping service ever
"30$ to ship 2 small computer chips just to realize after a week (and the day of projected arrival) that it hasn't even left its state of origin (IL) and that they will just let Canada Post finish the job when arriving in Canada??? Is it some kind of a joke? Total SCAM.

Pretty sure it would have taken the same time via a 5$ international shipping... Never doing this mistake again."
"I had 2 packages coming from them, 1 of which was $1000+, it was left on my porch without any signature, didn't knock, ring doorbell; absolutely nothing. Thankfully, 4 people were home and we found it relatively quickly. 2nd package has yet to arrive, never given an estimate or delivery date. It hasn't been updated in 10 days. Customer service is a robot which restates what the website tells me. No live service was available (at noon PST? Really?). Stay far away from Purolator, absolute garbage company."
After checking my security cameras it was evident there was NO attempt made at delivering my package. No delivery truck even showed up outside my house. I don’t know why companies keep using this system as their delivery service. I am now being forced to pick up my item weighing in at about 75 lbs worth 600$ from a location half an hour away from me. So an hour drive there and back plus loading up my items into my truck. I will be returning items for a full refund. Thanks for wasting my time. I think the whole premise of having an item delivered is so people are able to save TIME. Not so they come home after long days of work only to have to deal with this b****s***.

"worst service ever,charged 24 lbs for a box that weighed 1lb maybe ,from reddeer to nisku cost 54.00 ,NEVER AGAIN AM I USING THEM ,"
"I ordered a package on the 23rd of December 2020 and I have been waiting for 17 days for my package to arrive and it still hasn't, I also paid for express shipping and the package has yet to even be touched by Purolator. My friend recently ordered the exact same thing as me not too long ago and it only took him 3 days to get it with Purolator so I don't know what is going on with my package."
"Once again, I ordered something and the seller to my fear used Purolator and funny as hell, for the fourth consecutive time, the shipment not only missed its expected delivery date by a week, but is sitting in their stupid depot in Toronto status unchanged. I have had zero deliveries from Purolator that have actually made it to me on time or at all.
One has to wonder what kind of joke management runs this outfit but then I am reminded its Canada Post that owns them. Time to pressure the seller to give me a refund or put heat on Purolator to find my expensive package. What a bloody crap-show Purolator is"
"Not only did the driver not deliver the package to my door Dec 18 as indicated by them, they went about dropping it at Penguin Pick Up where it sat for 5 days. Then they returned the package to Dell. I had no idea any of this happened until it was too late and my laptop was returned. My security camera proves that the driver did not come to my house, where I was home anyway, and simply lied! And even if the liar had come to my house, he left no notice that the package was dropped at Penguin. So he is just a dumb liar. When I called customer service, they told me it was partially my fault because I should have been watching out for the package with tracking it. Aside from the fact that the Dell website said delivery is not expected until Jan 6th, it is incredibly rude for the service person to tell me this is partially my fault because I wasn't tracking and watching. Trust me not everybody is tracking their packages online, and not everybody knows a package is even coming to them! So Dumb!

So the driver is a liar and the service agent is just rude. Problem is I have already stopped using Purolator because they suck so bad compared to FedEx that I am left with no recourse other than to write this review!"
"Absolutely horrible horrible horrible. I’ve told Amazon if they use them for my delivery’s I’m canceling my account.
3 times they sent notice they couldn’t deliver and it was the wrong address. Now the 4th time they left a notice at the door we had to pick up our parcel, a 1 1/2 hour drive from where we live. Instead of leaving the notice they could have left the parcel, it weighs 2lbs.
Absolutely horrible service."
"I missed a scheduled delivery just because the driver was too lazy to ring the doorbell. If you can get to my doorstep and put a notice on the door, you can at least ring the doorbell. How am I supposed to know that our package is here if you don't indicate that you arrived? Now I have to go to Purolator to pick up a package I could have received if the delivery man just rang the doorbell."
"I always lost shipments from them through amazon.ca, but now Newegg and Dell shipments have been lost too. It just says item picked up but there is never any thing else reported on the item, so it takes me twice as long and a lot of customer support chats to get the item I ordered. I hate that things get shipped by this company I tried unsuccessfully to request other services, they still ended up getting shipped through Purolator. Like do people just steal Sh!t from this company that easily or are they that unorganized. I never had lost shipments for online orders till I moved to Canada and sh!t started going through them."
"Completely useless - booked next day delivery (1600km away) and the item arrived 11 days later. Sorry just don’t use them so they run out of customers and have to close down. Only power consumers have is not using and recommending.
Contacted them for feedback and got clear don’t care attitude."
The worst service...never trust this people because they will never deliver the package which the clam they delivered
"I have a very unique one here: Couple of days ago I phoned the purolator facility in London, ON. They physically confirming they had my tracked item since Wednesday 23rd Dec, they noticed like 6 delays and on holds since without any attempt of delivery.

Then I phoned/chatted Amazon same hour, and they've emailed Purolator to prioritise shipping.

Today, somehow the tracking webpage on purolator shows an attempt has been made and a notice was left at my address.

I was at home all day and I live in a residence that has intercom system and mailboxes and never had any problem in receiving Amazon or other couriers.

I phoned the facility locally in London, they said they have no way of contacting the driver who has the item (25KG item). I told them no notice can be find at all at my address.

They advised me to call customer service team who would be able to contact the driver for a re-attempted delivery today.

I phoned customer services (25-minutes waiting time, listening to the hold-on music which Shazam failed repeatedly to recognise). I then managed to speak to a very interesting Purolator representative, who told me that the facility staff do not know what they are doing and it's forbidden to contact the driver and he would never arrange such contact unless it's life-threatening like a bone marrow transplant sample !!!! he said he only goes by the book and his phone calls are recorded and seems quite confident, over-confident shall we say.

I took his name, but refused to take his ID when he dared to give it to me, also refused his offering to file a complaint on my behalf about his own company!!

The representative has a unique ability of regurgitating terms and conditions in an attempt to circumvent the simplest of answers you'd hope to hear, in addition to a discouraging ability whilst disturbing your thoughts and distracting you at ease with any irrelevant information.

I simply had to finish the call politely, I could not understand why a migraine was suddenly building up in my head listening to the representative. I basically wanted my item delivered, that is all - I did not want to complain.

Anyhow, I phoned the facility and told them about my interesting encounter with this gifted representative. They were shocked, furious and upset and kept apologising to me about something they have not done themselves. Yet, the problem is not solved, and it's likely that a driver is going around in town with my item, if allegedly attempted to deliver as the website says. At the end of the day, no delivery notice left and no evidence to support their claims.

Purolator: please stop insulting our intelligence us customers, and consider respecting your staff and the business you are supposed to honor and perform to the best of your human abilities. Also, train your staff not to complain and badly critique their colleagues, it's hard nowadays to hold a job so the priorities for your staff are:

be nice, kind and polite.

Thanks."
"Every time Purolator is shipping my Amazon package, there is a delay. And worse, they indicate an attempted delivery and that they didn't find me at home. I was home all day and I was waiting for the package. They don't want to pay delay fees to Amazon that's their problem. This is frustrating. I am not surprised to see all these bad reviews."
"My Amazon package, which was a Christmas gift, was ordered on Dec 13 and due to arrive on the 21st. Not only did it not arrive, but I had to spend hours on Perolator very bad customer service line to try to track it (it was last recorded being out for delivery on Dec 15 and then nothing - and the website wasn't updated). I finally convinced someone from customer service to put a tracer on the order after Christmas and then it was next registered to have arrived at a Mississauga warehouse on Dec 31. I spoke again to customer service (twice) on Jan 2 to see if they can tell me when the package would be delivered and they said, that no, they couldn't tell me. It may be delivered the week of the 4th. They don't deliver over the weekend(!!!) and they didn't deliver on Monday, Dec 28(!!!) and this is a busy time so it all depends on when they might have a truck ready. ARE YOU JOKING ME???? Amazon, seriously, you cannot continue to use this company! I have never heard of a delivery company that picks and chooses when they will make deliveries and doesn't work weekends!"
"1. Email Amazon support - request Purolator be deprioritized on your Amazon shipping profile. Wait two weeks
2. Enjoy parcels from every carrier other than purolator. delivered on time.
3. ??????
4. Profit
5. (optional) check quarterly for increased losses for purolator and revel in them if it happens"
"Tracking shows an item I ordered online has been with the local Purolator network since 10th December, it is now 1st January and there has been no tracking update since 14th December (delayed delivery) and no estimated delivery date. I have raised a query online and have received no further information. There is no option to arrange to pick up the item as an alternative to waiting for delivery, or any information on expected delivery timeframes or when to claim for a lost item."
"Soooooooo I have a history with Purolator. My husband’s Uncle works for them and he knows the absolute Moron who is assigned to our route. He began this history of hell when he wouldn’t deliver a package because my dog ...a senior lab who is beloved by—literally—EVERYONE who comes to our door to deliver, and who barks a little out of excitement (and also...duty!! Hello that’s his job) when someone comes to the door—anyhow when my dog barked at him from (get this) INSIDE the house. Good grief—the terror!! He put a note on my package that the dog was barking and I had to pick up my package. Obviously I called and complained. This did nothing but tick him off and the vindictive jerk will NOT deliver to our house on the premise that my dog (who can barely get up by the way) is vicious. I found out from my Uncle in law that Purolator drivers don’t have to drop off at the house if they use this excuse, but still get paid for the delivery just the same, so this guy is just skipping every house he can and dropping them off at the depot. Here’s me—pregnant with a toddler in a snowstorm having to go downtown (a town with hardly any available parking in front of the depot forcing me to walk far and carry heavy packages far distances) during Covid—a time when I am ordering mostly online to protect myself and my unborn child —and don’t even get me started with how incredibly rude the women at the depot is. Whole other issue as they absolutely refuse to try and make things in any way easy —they get mad if I drop in to see if there are any packages for me when I happen to be downtown—God FORBID I try to be proactive and cut into their standing around with having to check for me.
Back to my issue at hand—complaints don’t work with this company, there is “nothing they can do” —I’ve even got a hold of the head office. We thought we reached a solution which was to always be leaving my poor dog inside. I’ve left my dog inside on nice days when he could have been out—he still won’t deliver and finds ridiculous reasons—like he “can’t get up our hill because of snow” we have three access points to our house, one of them is a straight drive into the driveway, no hill required.
The tip of the iceberg for me was when I called head office and they asked if my neighbour had a dog. I almost lost my mind...like seriously? So even my neighbour can’t have a dog? By the way, she is also 12 and can barely walk and is a total sweetheart. Dude...if you have this many problems with dogs it’s one of two things: either you are an absolute lying jerk (my guess) or you are some sort of creepy pedophile and dogs are picking up on it.. And thanks to you Purolator for giving absolutely zero cares about people’s convenience or the reason they order things online for convenience in the first place. They are the absolute WORST COMPANY EVER and I urge every business not to order from them with hopes they go under. Sorry for my Uncle in law and everyone else but hey—I’m sure Amazon is hiring"
"I ordered a jacket from amazon and realized I ordered the wrong size. I contacted amazon and they told me that I can contact Purolator and ask them to stop my package from arriving. On my first call, the person told me they can't stop the package from coming yet because it is not in the same province yet. I am in BC and the package was in Ontario at the time. Called again just now to check if they can cancel it, and now the person told me they can't cancel the package until it gets on the truck on the day of the delivery. Why are they saying different things? They told me that I can refuse the package when it gets to my house but these guys never knock. They always just leave the package at my door. When I saw that the majority of the review for Purolator were negative, it explained a lot about them. Hopefully amazon never picks these guys again for my future orders."
"Seriously, what's wrong with Purolator, why your delivery never ring the bell? Now you leave the notice AGAIN and ask me to pick it up from so far away facility during pandemic?"
purolator is the absolute worst. says no one was home during delivery but I was standing near the door the whole time and there was no knock. avoid ordering if purolator is shipping
Worst service. They don’t deliver parcel on time.. you will be home all day waiting for the parcel and they will miss delivery saying customer not home.. worst worst service
My package was on the wrong truck and purolator had a routing issue. It will apparently take twice as long (even longer) for what I paid because my package is now really far from its destination. Adding the fact my item has been already delayed 3 times and it is an urgent one.
"Package was supposed to be delivered yesterday but was not even attempted, I tried online chat but my request was cancelled because no one was there to talk to me, I will try calling later today. There are no updates on where my package is or on if they will even attempt to deliver it."
"Had to give it one star as there was no option for zero stars. Ordered a package from Amazon. I live in an apartment, When they came (and left), they said there was a problem-they couldn't get in the building. Well duh, its locked! They didn't try the buzzer number, just left. When I called the customer service, they said there wasn't a door code so that's probably why. I told her(and also left a notice for them to use the door code on the Amazon site), to use 118 to get in(my apartment number). I don't know why a courier/mail service wouldn't know to try that when delivering packages??I told the customer service lady that they could even just phone me and I would come answer the door in case they couldn't figure out how to do the buzzer. Two times and they failed both times. And yes the buzzer works fine. I tried it and so did my manager. You can push 118, #118,*118,118*,or 118#. As long as the number ""118"" is pushed, it works!
When I was in the lobby trying to check for a note, or to see if my buzzer was an issue, my manager(and a couple from upstairs) were there. They all remarked at how horrible the service is from Purolator.
Neither time did Purolator leave a note. I tried after the second attempt to pick up my package in person, but due to Christmas, I spent over half an hour on the phone and gave up.
I am heading to a closer Purolator center to arrange to have my package delivered there, where I will pick it up in person."
"I paid 14 dollars for next day delivery. My package required an address correction ( my address was correct) but they never sent me an email, message or anything for me to know it needed attention. I went into their website to track my package after the 3rd day it was not delivered. Their website was not working and i had no information or the whereabouts of my package. I had to call a few times until someone actually helped me track my package. Now its been 9 days and I haven't received my package and I have to go pick it up , not only that my package is not ready for pick up until next week. So i paid 14 dollars to do their job....great. I will never pick purolator for delivery."
"Hands down the worst currier company ever! I received an email notice that There was an attempt delivery and a notification was left with instructions, actually there was no attempt as I was home all day and there wasn’t any notification ether nor of the where about of the package. Absolute bs. I was placed on hold for 1 hr with customer service explaining her that this was the 3rd time this has happened with there delivery service. Never will I ever recommend them to deliver any packages to anyone. Now I need to go pick up the package because the poor delivery driver can only do it in 4 business days from promised delivery date, What a joke of a company. I really hope they look at this as a review."
"Original post...Ordered a hard drive from newegg.ca on Dec 17, 2020. Order shipped on the 18th and was in town on the 21st and would be delivered that day. Did not come. Tracking said delivery missed and would deliver the next day. Did not come. Item has not arrived as of Dec 31 and no further updates after Dec 21st. Can't reach customer service to find out where the item is. VERY poor service. Update. Was able to finally contact customer service to my satisfaction. Parcel was delivered on Jan 5. Took 18 days for a 120 mile trip. Not impressed."
"the most rotten service
looks like they have one truck that drives the whole town
the driver decides whether to deliver the order or not
they deserve 0 and not one
I hope this company improves or disappears"
Unbelievably and undoubtedly the worst experience I have ever had. Sent a package the morning of the 23 . Was told it would be there the 26. It was one of two tablets for my twin granddaughters for Christmas. Paid 32.00 for overnight and was told the 26th the latest. Well its now the 30th and my package that was going less then 100 miles away is now over three thousand miles away .It was from Vancouver to Vancouver Island both in BC now its four provinces away in Ontario and can expect it i don't know when but now are saying January 8th. Are you kidding me? What a joke.
"Horrible service , don’t even deserve 1 star . Pathetic."
"How is this place still running in business? I wish I can give 0 stars. One thing they do right is maintain consistency on terrible service. I was able to get “real time” tracking for my package so I waited all day for it (not like we can do anything else during confinement anyways). And it was literally so close to my house (it actually is still close to my house but in another location). Purolator said they attempted to deliver (they most certainly did not lol). And they wrote online: Unable to deliver - receiver on vacation.. LOL ok how and why would they assume anyone is on vacation? And why didn’t they leave a notice? I was definitely home LOL.

I called to speak with a representative and he was just unhappy the whole conversation (makes sense, since Purolator has bad service, the company probably doesn’t treat its employees any better). He was also “shook” this happened and kept saying “it is what it is.” How philosophical LOL. I told him I’m able to pick it up it really doesn’t bother me, but guess what? No pick ups allowed in Montreal. How convenient!

He said he’ll try to get my package re-delivered again but was not sure (UMMMM TRY??? Ya you better try!!! the tracking still says you have my package! You better damn sure make sure you try LOL).

Anyways. Always and forever horrible. They need to just phase out Purolator. They are actually in the business of causing trouble."
"Lol if I could rate 0 I would.
Was suppose to receive a package, changed my plans to wait for this package as it said it was in transit. Look up my tracking later in the day and said it was attempted to be delivered. Driver never buzzed my apartment, nor did he leave a notice on my door to reschedule. Later that night I look at my phone, and I had a voice mail (weird cause my phone never rang) saying it was purolator and that they needed to me recall to reschedule delivery. Tried to do that and was on hold for over half hour until I hung up. Tried using their virtual assistant and it was poorly built and is not helpful at all. I called today to reschedule and they said the earlier they can get my package to me is Jan 4th, like come on people, so now I have to wait an extra week."
"Purolator were given the task of delivering a 95pound spin bike from Amazon for Xmas. Shipped on Dec 21 with delivery date scheduled for Dec 24. Shipping from Milton to Guelph ON (distance under 25k)
It is now Dec 30th and customer service still cannot guarantee delivery before the New Year.... Pathetic!!!"
"Purolator gave me 3 notices for the same tracking number. The 3 notices have different address. I came to the 3 addresses and they always told me that the item was not available here. Now my item was returned to sender.

I still dont understand why this company is still on the market. What a shame."
"Horrible customer service. The agent I spoke with was sooo rude for no reason - all I had asked her was when will the item be picked up. She goes ""excuse me you cannot tell us that"" all i was doing was asking a simple question politely for which she got soo rude and disrespectful for no reason. She raised her tone on me. My package has simply been sitting with them for past 15 days. She could have politely told me the process or informed me about the date that the order will be picked. Sooo disappointed. Had to wait 45 minutes to connect to a disrespectful, rude and arrogant agent who did not even help"
"0 star, if you live in an apartment and saw the courier is Purolator, cancel your order. If you don't, you will spend more time waiting, tracking down, or even fighting for your order. Do not ruin your daily life, or Christmas, or any holiday.
If you have to pick up the package from them with frustration and anger, just control yourself. Even if they might act arrogant and rude, their life under pandemic could be worse."
"Terrible!
Did not bother to ring the doorbell nor knock to announce arrival."
"Worst delivery company in Canada. Sadly owned by Canada post.

Always late. When it is not late drivers can't find addresses. What a joke.

Would recommend dell.ca to stop using this company for its deliveries."
"This company should cease to exist, or find itself a buyer. As a Canadian, I’m really ashamed. It’s Christmas of 2020, right in the middle of the COVID pandemic, and while I can appreciate running a business is more challenging in those difficult times, you can’t say you didn’t see this one coming, did you? I.e. Covid pandemic + Christmas (every year, duh) = more people ordering online. Guys, you had plenty of time to double up or triple up your staff to face the extra workload, it’s as simple as that. So many people have lost their jobs, they would jump on the opportunity. But no... let’s just cash in the big profits and too bad if Canadians are disgruntled, eh?"
"I was told my package would be delivered the next day, 8 days later and still no package and no estimate on delivery date. Customer service is horrible, they simply have the same info. as the customer in the Purolator tracking system.

Go with UPS, I have never ever had any problems with them."
"I think every package I’ve ever had delivered by purolator has been delayed in some way, shape, or form. I understand weather delays but when my package is in the city I live in and then it gets delayed by over a week after the storm it’s really unacceptable service. My package was supposed to be delivered on the 23rd but it still says weather delayed on there website and has not been updated since the 22nd is super frustrating."
"Worst company in history. Drivers decide if they should drop off the package or not, even if it is mentioned to drop off the item at a safe place without signature. They then tell us to pick up the package on a date that they are closed. Seriously, this item was shipped from the same city I live in, i got another item from another country before this one. Both were ordered on the same day.
Nice going Purolator 👍🏻"
"We missed our package on Friday (December 25th), and the slip told us that we had to go to an address to pick it up on Monday (December 28th). We went there today, however the yard was closed. They didn't notify us about it not being open, and we will have to go back tomorrow to get our package. Unbelievable, either their employees don't know what their own times are, or their whole company is terrible with shipping, pick up and drop off. After tomorrow, I will never patronize this company ever again."
"Ordered from Amazon.ca on a date that was safe for delivery before Christmas 2020.
Ha..... delivery trusted to Purolator. They missed the date it is now Dec 27 and still no package. How imbarrasing when you have to tell a loved one on Christmas morning there gift isn't here yet.
Website tracking is pitiful, says picked up Dec 16 in Toronto. THAT IS WERE IT ENDS FOLKS. Was told on Christmas day it will be here in 48 hrs, well guess what, yea no package.
I hope this company isn't involved with shipping Covid 19 vaccines when people's lives are at stake."
"Terrible service. I have been waiting since December 16th. Ordered another item through Canada Post, came 2 days before Christmas. Awful, awful delivery company. Now mechanical delay. Now I see its just like the old crap others are complaining about!"
"Purolator is a joke!
Only courier that I've had any issues with. Their tracking and customer service is useless. I ordered a product on Dec 12th as a Christmas gift... It's coming from a warehouse 30 mins from my house but still has not arrived. It goes through 2-3 locations before even getting delivered. The tracking says missed delivery and will be carried out in the next delivery day.. Ya that was 10 days ago. I call their customer service and they can't tell me anything bc they have no clue either. I even offered to pick it up myself but they said it's impossible because they wont be able to find the package with all of the ones they have???!! Honestly pure joke, and it's like they don't even care or do anything about it. Avoid this mess at all costs. Pay extra and use someone else"
"Purolator drivers consistently mark packages as an ""attempted delivery"" without actually trying to deliver the package. Then they require that you either pick up the package at a depot that's very out of the way or reschedule a delivery. They put the responsibility on the receiver even if the driver lies about the delivery attempt. When ordering from Amazon, Amazon marks this outright scam as ""delivered"". So you are forced at this point to deal with these crooks."
"Missed Christmas deadline... The tracker said “due for delivery until 8pm” on the 24th until the time passed and they didn’t deliver. As they don’t work on the 25th or 26th either, there is no Christmas present this year thanks to Purolator."
"thank for your terrible service so my Christmas gift for my hb still playing around somewhere outside.
December 21 estimated delivery day: waited whole day and nothing came, checked again day after and “not available “
Today December 24 estimated delivery day again: i stay home waiting and now check again “ Not available “ again
🤣 you guy not even deserve 1 star for your service, so terrible 👎"
"Hands down worst delivery service. They were to drop of a larger item to my apt building and the expected date of delivery was Dec 17th. They did not even make an attempt to deliver the package (item is a couch from Wayfair) once .... Instead just left it at a pick-up center. I called and spoke to one of their agents who said she didn't understand why they didn't make an attempt to deliver but told me my package would arrive on the 21st/22nd Dec. It did not arrive on the 21st, I called again to inquire if it would be delivered the following day as I didn't want to lose another day waiting at home. The rep said that yes it would be dropped of on the 22nd, which as you can guess it was not. I called again on the 24th only to be told this time that the earliest I would receive it would be the 29th of Dec but more than likely it would be sometime after that... 12 days after the expected arrival date and still not even one attempt to deliver. I have now made other arrangements at personal financial cost to myself to retrieve my package. I would rate lower if I could, only saving grace was that their reps were polite on the phone."
"The Purolator online tracking function is useless. It is now Dec.24th and the tracking was last updated on Dec. 11th, assuring me of delivery the next business day. But still nothing. The central office told me the item is in my hometown Purolator office but the local office says it is still in Mississauga, 200 kms. away. People in both offices have also lied to me about when I would receive the delivery. If it was an option I would give zero stars to this business. I will also avoid making future online purchases from any online retailer that uses this shipping company."
"December 17, a week ago, we paid Purolator $130 to ship a large box to our son Thomas, working offering front line healthcare in Nova Scotia. We could have gone with Canada Post (remarkably, we still had time) but wanted to be ""sure"" Christmas would arrive for him, and were comforted by the clerk's words, ""It should be there by Saturday."" Perhaps we should have asked which Saturday. It's December 24, a week later, and Purolator has no idea where the package is. I know there are those whose Christmases will be much more difficult than ours. And Thomas is in the care of much loved family in Nova Scotia. But I've been awake since 3:15 with a mixture of anger and sadness over this. Next year I'll use Canada Post."
"The driver lied about ""attempted delivery- recipient unavailable"" if you are just working from home.
It's so unprofessional, there was no note left on the door."
I wish i give no star to this company...no credibility at all...i ordered a sofa from Wayfair since November 25 and i've been told my package will arrive Dec 4 ..i called customer service many times...Different scenarios ...Just bunch of liars ....no sign of my package....
"Purolator has a Printable sticker that you attach directly to the envelope which has drastically reduced the plastic consumption I use. Because of this, I now choose to use Purolator exclusively! Well done!!"
For sure the last time i will ever work with that business ever. Lack of humanity
Crappiest courier out there. Leave packages on the driveway - no updates - they lie and tell you they attempted delivery when cameras outside show nothing / zilch / nada. The absolute worst - don't use them.
"Terrible experience, two times with different deliveries in the past couple weeks. Absolutely no way to reach anyone to find answers to where packages are. On hold for for 30minutes+ every single time minimum for about 6 times now, different times of days, no answer. I end up giving up. Their online tools don't work either, tried the app, the online account, chat, nothing works. No way to get actual answers to where my packages are."
I asked to have a package picked up and shipped to our office. First they said the package cannot be delivered because the office was close - they delivered it around 8pm of course the office was close. Second attempt they said office was closed again and it was 1:11 pm - the office was open and there is a phone number why they didn’t call? This is totally unacceptable and our office is just beside Mississauga head office. They didn’t leave also a notice that the package can be picked up and now they are returning it to the place where I asked the package to be picked up. Unreliable service.
Package was suppose to arrive with another package Dec 21. One was delivered and the other never showed up. Tracking says delivered got missed. Contacted customer service for only them to say it never went out. Don’t understand why it keeps getting missed and why it wouldn’t go out the next day?
"Ordered package on Nov 30th, I was scheduled to receive in on Dec 9th. I get an update on Dec 11th saying it is oversized and will be delayed(4-7 days). Its been way past 10 days. Called customer support and they told me it would be delivered on the 20th, no show. Sent PM on Twitter and rep told me on the 22nd, no show. What the hell is going on??"
"The worst service ever from a service provider!
Is there a negative button?? Like others, the package is in Richmond warehouse, no updates on tracking site, CHAT service is hit and miss with available operators, no phone operators. CHAT agent when available confirmed that there is no information about when the package will be on the truck for delivery, the party must be home and the tracking updates go out at 10:30 am. The recipient must hurry back from work to sit and wait for the delivery. What kind of service is this? Like others this year, several packages had to be sent out via different services. Canada Post, UPS, FedEx all managed to have their stuff together. All overpriced but, at least helpful. Companies show their commitment to customers in stressful times. Shipping delays may be acceptable if they can at least provide information for the date when the item will be delivered. Not even being able to do that is NOT ACCEPTABLE."
"This delivery service is a BIG NO NO. unfortunately I have had them deliver packages to me from online other three times. All three time the delivery person never bothers knocking on my door (I can see from my house camera) and they just leave a pick up sheet which has inaccurate information. This resulted in me wasting my time in search for the package all three times!!!! Do you self a favour people, do not EVEN BOTHER USING this company. Safe yourselves the stress associated with their crap of a service."
"Purlator was on the plus side of good service. My package stayed a shipment center 2 hours away for days, but after finally arriving in my city 5 days later, was shipped same day. Courier kindly rang my buzz code ( I’ve had several who don’t ring. Just drop and run!), and instead of putting it in lobby in front of mailbox, (likes a few others do), actually dropped off at apt Door! ( I was working so wasn’t home). Overall, fairly acceptable service, it is close to Xmas, so I understand the slight delay..😁"
"The worst service for the longest time...to bad there are not negative stars to give. I know companies who use them - why would you subject your customers to their terrible service. As a consumer, I am waiting for a Wayfair delivery....I ordered two identical items. One was delivered a week ago by FEDEX (Love!), the second seems to be stuck in the freaking twilight zone of the Purolator depot. No updates on tracking website, no CHAT available (no available operators) NO phone customer service reps available. I spoke to an agent yesterday finally. She could not tell me at all when it will be delivered. I finally asked 'just tell me is it at the local warehouse?' and she did say oh yes, its in Richmond at their DC but has no idea when delivery may happen. I don't want to shoot the messenger, it isnt the fault of the CS agent, but management, GET IT TOGETHER!! hire more staff, revamp your systems or whatever you need to do!! If USP and Fedex can do it, why cant you? The worst..........."
"I ordered from BestBuy and item was shipped Dec 15th from Brampton to Hamilton and it has been just sitting in their truck since then. Constantly updating next business day to next business day but nothing happening since Dec 15th. Horrible service. Worst company to deal with. Ordered from Amazon and many other sites after Dec 15th and delivery came from Intelcom, Fedex and UPS without any issues. Purolator sucks and i hope no one uses them in the future."
"Avoid this company like the plague. I ordered a package the 6th, and it's been in Mississauga since the 12th. I live within a 20 min drive, what is taking so long? Plus they tell me that I can't come and pick it up myself, my expensive TV is sitting somewhere in a wearhouse probably being tossed around. Never again."
"I would give them 0 stars if I could. I've always had problems with Purolator. I always get notices saying they attempted a delivery but no one was home, which is a lie. There is always at least one person at home and there was no knock or doorbell when they ""attempt"" their delivery. Now, they lost one of my packages and did not even tell me when I contacted them and simply gave me a generic answer of their delays. They are definitely the worst carrier I have ever dealt with."
"My package was being shipped from Toronto to Winnipeg, with an estimated delivery time of four business days. The day it was supposed to be delivered, tracking system pops up ""Weather delay - service will resume, weather permitting,"" at which point no further delivery estimates were provided. The package was eventually delivered 11 days (including four weekend days) after it was recorded as having left the sort facility in Toronto. Shipper might as well have dropped it in the mail, for a lot less money."
"Purolator back at their business for the Holidays. Three important packages I was supposed to get last week. All three were “on the truck for delivery” Thursday- then rescheduled for the next business day for no reason. All three were “on the truck for delivery” Friday, not delivered, rescheduled for the next business day. Yesterday Monday- all three were “on the truck for delivery” and does anyone want to guess what happened yesterday? Oh, yep- not delivered. Rescheduled for the next business day which is today. Wouldn’t it be easier at this point to deliver them? Zero chance I’ll get these by Christmas it seems. Already had Purolator deprioritized on Amazon and this was why. No more Amazon shopping for us, not when this terrible company is allowed to do whatever they want with our packages every day- except deliver them.

Update: Still no packages. Gonna be tough to explain to a 10 year old who will be missing out on his main gift. We tried to avoid this re: de-prioritization with Amazon. We’ve now decided we will just no longer deal with Amazon so we can no longer have to deal with Purolator."
"It's the same story all over again, but what surprised me was that there was a delivery notice left. I've been home all day waiting for my package, and I see a missed delivery notice. There's a doorbell right where the notice was left. If I'm going to always drive to the airport to pick up my package, why do I even wait for the delivery. Purolator obviously doesn't care about their costumers, otherwise they would of done something about this."
"Do they even deliver packages anymore?
I'm sure they just mark them delivered.
3 times now get a notification saying delivered
With not a package in sight, Brutal !!"
"Worst services ever!!! Order a PS5 and BestBuy did a great job by have it ready next day. Actually they just need to pick up from Brampton and deliver to Richmond Hill. I wait a few days and got no update then have to call the customer services. They know nothing but just create a “ticket”. The tracing specialist gave me a reply saying they will investigate. Then a few days pass until now I realize my package went to Vancouver!!! My home just 40KM away from BestBuy but they shipped my item to 5000KM away and still no response. I feel my package is literally being kidnapped. Absolutely garbage services, don’t understand why this company exists. And as customers we cannot do anything, feel so frustrated."
"Used them for my business 20 years ago for a short time. Terrible... beyond belief.

Recently have had a company ship a purchase to me by Purolator. It was deemed necessary by Purolator to contact me to arrange delivery. There has been no contact for six days."
I ordered a ps5 and it’s been 5 days and still never got it ? What the hell
"Please sign this petition against purolator.

http://chng. it/yWMQzwSJ"
"""Lost"" a 65"" TV, no communication, and just a terrible company. Would give 0 if I could.

EDIT: TV finally arrived 1 month late, and was cracked. Shipping box was damaged in multiple areas, and it was left on doorstep with no signature or anything. I'm amazed Purolator still exists (at least as of this comment)."
"• Purolator Lies.

They pretend they “delivered” the product but all the driver did was to get off his van, stick a notice on the main glass panel of the entrance to my building and leave. A camera and recording system in the building shows exactly what he did.. Purolator will say.. he did his job.... (what, a sticking job???)

• Purolator is lazy.

They will ask you to get a package that was paid for with shipping cost by you from a sender. The Purolator van parks in a handicapped parking, (even more violation)..in a large mall parkade.. There the driver sits waits with his coffee and Subway sandwich. He plays with his cell phone.. really busy. His thumb and fingers must be truly injured from his cell phone use all day..Sorry, he can't deliver. He just sits there despite the fact that the package says “deliver to _____(Address)

• Purolator delivers packages- broken and unsealed…

if there is liquid inside, the liquid spills

• Purolator- hit and run...
Will deliver your package and leave it outside the building. They will register your package as delivered. But someone stole the package and you’ll have a hard time contradicting them because they will lie. But I have a camera and tape in my building.

• Purolator makes you sick.

Will contribute to overwhelming Canadian health care system.... will cause you high blood pressure, stomach upset and other ailments as you will get sick spending money to buy something from Amazon yet Purolator does not deliver.

• Purolator drivers are magicians...

They're faster than the speed of light ..will ring your building buzzer once,, then the lazy driver hangs up and posts a notice on the outside building door. The camera shows he rang the buzzer then, he disappears. Wow- like magic..

• Purolator drivers are lazy and it's your fault!!

Their call center now makes COVID as an excuse for non-delivery, for waiting too long on the phone before they answer and it’ s your always fault.

What solutions can you do to avoid Purolator?
• If there is a Canada Postal Office near you, you are better off going to the PO and claim your package when you can. The PO will hold your package in their storage and will wait for you to pick it up.
• Use other services
• Don’t order from Amazon if Purolator is part of the deal.
• Don’t give Purolator the chance to make money because it is your money not theirs and they have to earn it to get your money’s worth,
• The message is plain and simple: PUROLATOR, don’t be lazy. Be honest. Be considerate. The people you deliver the packages to are paying customers. Give them their fair share of the business- they are the buyers and you are only as good as if you stop being dishonest, lying and provide good service."
My shipping was thirty bucks and my package got delayed twice and still don’t have it. So I call and I’m on hold for a hour. Not impressed at all and won’t be using this shipping company again
Very bad company they stole my parcel I didn’t receive it but I have received message it delivered and I called them they said may be someone took it they are liars and thieves please be careful don’t deal with them fraud company
"Whenever I order something online, and they use Purolator as the courier, I immediately give up all hope of receiving what I ordered. How this company is still operating is a mystery to me. Why do company’s like Amazon use Purolator. I have never received any of my orders when Purolator have been involved. A 1 star review does not justify just how bad they are!"
"They delivered my package to a different city and never respond to my request and case!

The first time is in July, I purchased a piece of fitness equipment from Amazon that worth $200, the shipment was delayed (as always) and then delivered to the wrong address. I filed a complaint and they said would reply to me by the end of the day, July 2. Not a word till now.

On Black Friday, I ordered a therapy table worth $200 and again, Purolator is the carrier. Again, the shipment was late 2 weeks and no surprise delivered to the SAME WRONG ADDRESS! I wonder who's the lucky family that has been receiving my orders. Probably someone working for that company, what a nice coincidence."
"My package was just thrown into the soil in the garden and my parents almost thought that it was garbage and was almost thrown out. I’m not too sure why it couldn’t have just been put on the porch, or in the mailbox. Bad experience ! I don’t like the experience !"
"This is the worst carrier in the whole industry. They always mislead customers, often give wrong tracking information and always late in delivery. I will never use their service in future."
Say they tried yet my camera has never seen a driver at the door. Even left a note for driver to ring twice. Lazy drivers that don't want to get out of their vehicles.
"I understand sometimes a package takes longer than usual. But why can't you get an answer from purolator.
They insult your intelligence with their chat bots. The tracking said ""Delayed in transit due to missed connection"". What does that mean? No one knows. Not even purolator."
"If I had a choice I would not use Purolator for delivering my packages. After speaking to the Driver and calling Purolator customer service, the driver continues to leave packages at the bottom of our driveway, regardless of the weather conditions, although I would understand if there was a foot of snow. Imagine ordering an electronic device and it is left in the pouring rain under a tree. :(
Purolator's Customer Service just responds with; ""It is up to the Driver's discretion.""
While I agree our driveway is steep and long, other curriers; UPS, FedEx and Canada Post all drive up our driveway and walk up our path to deliver the package to our front door. Not to mention their trucks are bigger than the Purolator truck that delivers to our place. So I fail to understand why this particular currier will not deliver our package to our front door?
Unfortunately I am not able to instruct Amazon on the curriers they contract with. If I could, I would not recommend Purolator."
"Had a package stolen from me, the driver ended up taking the package and fabricating evidence that it was dropped off. they stated that i signed off on the package when we never did will never order with them again considering a lawsuit"
Why they do not provide an option to drop the item at door and the pick up location is 11.3km away?
My order is still in another province it hasn't moved for almost 2 days now. They also messed up my order I had to contact them twice to change the shipping address which I still don't know is updated or not. Don't waste your time with them.
"The worst delivery company in the world. I ordered $500 from bestbuy which they delivered to the wrong apartment and then marked as handed to me, yet it was on their door step. Regularly missed deliveries, pickup points are miles away, and worst customer service ever.

Any company that uses them loses my business."
"Reading the reviews I don’t think I can add anything new to the worst experiences by customers before me. My package was delivered and dropped off at a totally different address and left at their door. Luckily I was able to see the address on the tracking. It was about ten minutes drive from my place and my husband rushed there. The people there did not take my 73 LB bookcase to their home yet (along with their own order). So we managed to save our $400 purchase.
Purolator hires anyone who own and drive a car as shipping business is booming now. The worst part is that despite the thousands of disappointed and furious customer reviews they are still in business. I wonder if their customer service reads reviews and follows up on them. Probably not."
"On the day Purolator said my package was out for delivery, their tracking app said that the address was incomplete: missing buzzer number! Does anyone really not know that if there is an Entryphone at a condominium building, enter the name of the person you wish to speak to and the buzzer number will be provided? Anyway, after several “Chats” I provided the buzzer number. The next day, the Purolator app now said that my address was incomplete - it was not! - or incorrect - it was not! After several more “Chats”, I gave up and had the package delivered to a “convenient” Purolator pick up site and picked it up there. From now on, I will refuse to purchase any items from vendors who say my items will be delivered by Purolator."
"Purolator never misses a chance to disappoint you. Every time they manage to get 0 stars leaving you frustrated. This company must be kicked out of the courier business. No idea where the authorities are and why don't they monitor companies like PURO-LOOTER

Every time when you place an online order, make sure your order is not delivered through this company.

It was a shocking reality for me that Puro-LOOTER is a subsidiary of Canada Post. Disgusting service, they do everything to not to improve their service."
"Dear lord! How is the company still in business and why do companies continue to use them to ship their products?!

“Delivery was attempted, no one was home” BULL! I was home all day, I have a dog- so even if by some reason I went temporarily deaf and missed the doorbell my dog would hear someone at the door and go bananas. He slept soundly all day. I really think the drivers just park in different neighborhoods and then mark all the packages as “undeliverable” and then move on. I’ve had to deal with this mess of a company three times and each time they have just messed up the delivery or not delivered it at all. The customer service is also a joke and no one gives a damn."
"Terrible service to say the least! Upon tracking my package I notice it stated that it had been delivered the day prior without any call for me to meet them at the lobby of my condo and that they handed it to an individual?? I received absolutely no call that Purolator was even in the building, let alone me being downstairs to receive my package! I currently do not have the package that I have payed for and they are refusing to take responsibility. The company I ordered from pays Purolator to take signatures prior to releasing the package to the receiver, however, they didn’t take a signature nor ask for an ID??
I genuinely do not comprehend how they are still operating. I will make sure to AVOID any orders that are delivered by Purolator!!!!"
2nd part of my order arrived today - this time to the correct address!! But THROWN on the doorstep- no one knocked or rang the doorbell!!! Glad it wasn’t breakable!!!
"A shame, a disgrace, a waste, whatever about the true demonic you can neme.
It must be FIRED!"
"They sent my parcel to the wrong place, as clearly demonstrated on the proof of delivery. However, their agent, after days of investigation, told me that he didn’t know what happened. He told me he would just close the case, and asked me to contact the shipper. I told him that I didn’t know how to contact the shipper but he never responded. Simply the worst :P BTW, the pick up service is messy as hell, too."
"Less than zero.
The delivery truck in front of my apartment and I'm waiting for the package. How much of a surprise when I checked the online tracking said attempt delivery - receiver unavailable, the guy even didn't leave a notice where I can pick up by myself. Unbelievable"
"Worst delivery service I’ve ever dealt with. After requesting to pickup my parcel, they held onto it at the pickup location for 3 weeks before saying it was ready to pickup. Upon receiving the package, the box had multiple tears in it. The box was extremely beat up and looks like it was purposely beat up to get back at me for calling multiple times in regards to them holding my package for so long. When greeted to pickup my parcel, the service people were extremely rude and did not seem like they wanted to be there."
"On Purolator website's is saying ""On vehicle for delivery"", for my surprise I was on my apartment window when I saw Purolator truck at the corner; I ran out downstairs in order to meet the driver, but miserably the truck was gone. I then put a post it to Purolator on my building's front door, saying I am home all day long and my Building Code is xxxx, just buzz me and I will meet you there. Let's see if by midnight today I will receive my package that was supposed to be delivered by Newegga.ca on December 07."
"If there was a zero star, I would give that. They do not attempt delivery, but updates that they did. Never call the receiver. This happened in all three time the sender used Purolator. They are not honest. Also, they do not have any customer support."
They don’t even have a customer service. They don’t pick calls. They have no agents for online chats. There’s no way to monitor a shipment. Do not use this under any circumstances.
I’ve had Parcels dating back to November 27... keeps saying- purolator didn’t get the package in time to put it on the order... no tracking information being updated. I get covid is slowing things down but it was just as bad pre-covid. Terrible slow service.
"Package arrived in Canada on Dec 10th, they had it for 1 hour 25 minutes and it ""missed"" a connection and is delayed. No updates for 4 days now, looks like its not a missed connection but a missing package. Why would a top of the line gaming monitor go missing.... the AI is useless, the Call in number waits are over 30 minutes, no call back option. I have had to abandon my unanswered calls to Purolator. Never has say Fedex treated us this way."
"My parcel shipped November 30th and has not updated since December 3rd due to a mechanical difficulty. The one time I got a hold of costumer service they just copy and pasted ""4 days late due to covid"". Like a lot of people I am questioning if they even have the ability to deliver parcels.

Edit. Now it is going to take 5 more days and they acknowledge their tracking does not work and won't update but you should sign up for their text notification. What a joke."
Purolator is the worst courier service out there! The latest is they have flagged a 2kg package as oversized and say that is reason to delay delivery by 4-7 days. Oh and they are really busy so there is nothing they can do about that. My package has been sitting at the depot in Toronto for almost a week now. FedEx had a similar package to me in 2 days! I will be going out of my way from now on to make sure as little as possible gets sent to me via Purolator...
Can't believe I have to give a star! I wouldn't p*ss on you if you were on fire purolator! I'd look for a can of gas ! Lying crooked worthless company. U guys should be sued and out of business . I cant believe a company so bad is allowed to operate. U should be shut down !
"AMAZON NEEDS TO STOP USING PUROLATOR OR THEY WILL LOSE MY BUSINESS!!! I'M DEAD SERIOUS!!!! I ORDER AT LEAST 10 ORDERS ON AMAZON PER MONTH AND I ONLY EVER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE DELIVERIES MADE BY PUROLATOR, OR SHOULD I SAY NOT MADE. THEY ALWAYS SAY THEY LEFT A NOTICE IN MY BUILDING BUT I'VE YET TO FIND ONE. I NEVER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH CANADA POST, AMAZON DELIVERY, PITNEY BOWES, INTELCOM!!!! ONLY PUROLATOR ALWAYS HAS AN ISSUE. WHEN I SEE THAT PUROLATOR WILL BE DELIVERING MY AMAZON ORDER, I JUST FORGET ABOUT THE PACKAGE AS I KNOW IT WILL JUST BE TOO STRESSFUL TO KEEP TRACKING IT. THEY DRIVE IN THERE TRUCKS ALL DAY AND CAN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THEIR SEATS, LAZY AS F***!!! IF I COULD GIVE THEM A ZERO, I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD. I WOULDN'T USE THEM EVEN IF IT WAS FREE. SHAME ON YOU PUROLATOR!!!"
They outdo their own unprofessionalism every time...
Why can’t a major shipping company get their act together. Purolator is struggling to deliver my package. This has been the worst experience. No relevant updates and the damned tracking says that the package is on the vehicle for delivery and yet the delivery never comes. I will be calling to request to pick up the damned package myself - otherwise it will be continuously lost in package purgatory - forever ‘on vehicle for delivery’.
"so purolator sucks... i would not recommend buying from a company that uses purolator as a carrier (ask if there are other carriers available) here’s why: my package was supposed to arrive on nov 30, i checked the website and it’s delayed (covid reasons), fine. same week i check again, nothing, monday (dec 7), nothing. i decide to check on the status on tuesday (dec 8) and see that an address correction is needed, so i try calling purolator to do so, on the phone for about 30 mins to 1 hr, i give up. i try again the next day (dec 9), still nothing, the same day, i resorted to just calling zara (i ordered from them) and getting them to handle it. my package FINALLY arrived yesterday (dec 11), BUT the packaging was damaged AND the box was opened...... overrall, a terrible experience with purolator, so would not recommend. their email team is somewhat helpful but not really."
"AMAZON SHOUD NOT USE THIS SERVICE. VERY BAD SERVICE , TRY TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE WAIT ON LINE 1 HOUR, NO ANSWER !!! I WILL MAKE SURE THAT MY COMPANY DONT USE THERE SERVICE ANY MORE !!!"
"Missed Delivery. 3 times.

How do you missed delivery when 6 of your purolator trucks went by in a span of 3 days?

I'm starting to think Purolator just get off on negative reviews. -_-"
"COPY OF EMAIL SENT TO PUROLATOR MGMT
Customer Complaint! Your company provides the worst customer service of any organization that I have dealt with in the last 60 years! When are you going to get your “SH#T TOGETHER” and do your job??? I called to request assistance from Purolator Customer Service on Thursday with an expected delivery, only to be told that there was nothing that could be done about a “Signature Required” Policy for a package that was to be delivered by Purolator on Friday at my location… The customer service rep was extremely rude! I then logged into my account and set the “NSR”, and then proceeded to change my schedule for Friday to make sure that I would be here to receive the package – Because the last time this happened, your company lost my package for 2 WEEKS!!!!!!!!! Someone decided to cancel the delivery and send it on the NEXT BUSINESS DAY!! So I had to let another one of MY customers down due to the failed delivery by Purolator AGAIN ! Thanks for such stellar service you total jacka##es! It is obvious that you are 91% owned by Canada Post.   Sincerely ..."
"I ordered an expensive computer monitor from Amazon on Black Friday, November 27. Amazon says to expect it December 8. November 29 I get the notification that it has shipped. Check Purolator tracking, it says ""shipping label created."" All seems good.

Check back a few days later to see where it is. Still says ""shipping label created"" with no other info. That's less good...

Check on December 7... still says ""shipping label created."" Still looks like it hasn't left Alberta for my address in Ontario.

Amazon says I have to be at home to sign for package. I called Amazon, and tell them Purolator doesn't show that it has moved. They tell me ""don't worry, it will be there today, you should be home to sign for it."" I make arrangements to be home... No monitor.

Call purolator that night. After 40 mins on hold am told by the rep ""yeah, I don't know why that is... I can only see the information that you have."" Yeah... thanks a lot.

2 days later, still nothing. Call Amazon. Amazon has cancelled the order and is sending a new one but will not be available until mid January. Guess I won't have it by Christmas. Not sure whether to blame Amazon or Purolator, but at this point I'm thinking Purolator."
"""Amazing"" (not) delivery service!
First they schedule pickup time range within 8:00 am and 9:00 pm and when you had spent whole day for waiting courier it never came. And there wasnt Any notification or call that it wont come! Burn in hell!!!!!"
"If I could give zero stars, I would. My packages came 15 days late without any explanation and their chat service is horrendous. They lie to you to reassure you that the package will arrive (when it clearly doesn't) within 1 - 3 business days. In addition to their terrible chat service, their delivery service is just as bad. They are the laziest people on the entire planet as they missed delivering to my house 3 times within the span of two whole weeks due to construction on my street. They did not even bother to park the truck and deliver to my house. I had to stand outside and chase the delivery truck to get my package. Whenever I see a product I like but ship Purolator, I say hell no."
"the delivery drivers often don't even ring the bell and just leave a delivery notice while I'm at home all day. The customer service is horrible, I recommend to avoid purolator at all cost 🤮"
Avoid it all cost.I've ordered computer from newegg its shipped on dec 7th with express shipping.Supposed to come be delivered next day.Been waiting for 5 days now and no update.Absolutely irresponsible and poor customer service.
"Red Deer, Alberta (Queens drive) has the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Make sure you track your parcels as they DO NOT phone you or email you or contact you in anyway when your parcel arrives at their depot and its your fault if they send it back. They sent 2 of my parcels back cause apparently I didn't pick up?? Christmas Season?? I didn't even know that Amazon sent with Purolator and didnt' receive any type of contact letting me know they were here. Trying to ask the lady at the office questions about it this morning, she was rude and very unprofessional. She cut me off as I was trying to speak, blaming everything I said on me or a ""glitch"". Would not get a supervisor, accused me of yelling when I couldn't even get a word in. She was a total ""B"" and should NOT work with the public. I would NEVER use them as I've never had a good experience, just wish we had the option of who are items are being sent with. Especially with all the online shopping being done this season."
"Had two shipments with them. Both still haven't arrived days later than expected. Delays without notifications. ""Out for delivery"" and then not delivered. So much for ""promises delivered."""
"I wish I could give Purolator zero. The delivery is🤮awful. They don't even attempt to drop off your package before they place it in their pick up location. I already paid to deliver my product,now I have to pay uber to pick up. Outrageous. And their online staff is sooo rude. Disgusted."
"I ordered a bunch of yarn to make blankets for Christmas, all of which were ordered from Michaels and therefore they were shipped with Purolator. I've made about 3 blankets so far and my 15 balls of yarn came no problem. I'm trying to make another blanket and have the 4 balls of yarn and I'm still waiting on one more. On Nov 24th I got an email that there was a pandemic delay of 2-7 days. It is now December 10th, and I've chatted with the most useless customer service people. I also now have a case open, where again the people running the case are USELESS. I'm so fed up at this point. The customer service person told me that it's because my package is and I quote ""Heavy and Oversized"". Now this surprised me because on the product information it says my package weighs 1.93 POUNDS. So how does that constitute being heavy and oversized. Please if you have a choice to not go with Purolator, do yourself a favour."
"I ordered a blanket from hush it was shipped with Purolator, i received text message updates regarding my shipment. On dec 3, i received a text at 10:23 that my package was delivered i check my garage entrance and front door and my package was no where to be found. I called Purolator right away to report this, i waited 40 minutes on the phone and additionally a week for them to review the case only to have them lie to me. My neighbour received my package we have very similar addresses i reported this when i called yet they dismissed their mistake and said it was delivered correctly to the right address. They basically implied there was nothing wrong because the shipper did not request a signature to release the package. If my neighbour did not inform me they were the ones to receive my package i would be out $279. This has happened twice now with Purolator and never with any other delivery company. I would advise anyone to avoid their service as they are liars, unreliable and take no responsibility for mistakes they make."
"Purulator is the worst company to have deliver your product. Their customer service department is horrible as for 3-5 days they have not changed my mailing address so my package remains in “change address” stage meaning it doesn’t leave the delivery centre even though I speak with them on the phone and they assure me it has been corrected. You also wait on hold for 45-85 minutes just to speak with someone which has happened to me at least 6-8 times. As well the delivery drives to do not leave notices or make any attempt to deliver the packages.

This is by far the worst shipping company and I refuse to voluntarily deal with them."
"I wish I could give zero star. It says on the tracking on the 1st day thatit was on vehicle for delivery, then rescheduled, 2nd day on vehicle then rescheduled again. 3rd day it says already delivered. I was at home all day but no package showed up. The tracking says rescheduled again. How is that possible delivered and rescheduled. I called purolator and they said it was delivered on the wrong address lol..Worst company ever!!! Never again.."
"Total garbage. They have my address and code to get in the building but repeatedly don't deliver because they claim not to have access to the building. I've waited one week for a one day delivery and still don't know when I'll be able to get my package. At this point, it looks like I'll have to take an hour long ride on public transit, during a pandemic, to the warehouse to pick it up myself."
"Purolator has had a package crated waiting for pick up for 2 days, I have tried calling the 1-888 number and put on hold for over 45 min. on 3 attempts. I than requested a Customer Service Rep. call me, that's impossible. So I requested online chat. After attempting to provide my info, the topic of request couldn't be high
lited so the line was discontinued. This is not acceptable."
"Lying thieves, claims to have delivered a large parcel outside the door at 9 PM, Which is a bogus claim. Most likely they just stole the parcel. I have never had this happen with any other courier service.

DO NOT USE PUROLATOR!"
"Had two orders shipped via Purolator (not by personal choice). Both now state (Delivery Attempted - Receiver Inaccessible) and show no estimated delivery date. This is crap as there has been someone at this location for the past four days during which they claim they've attempted delivery.
Try to call them to get an answer? Yeah good luck, I spent over an hour on hold, finally get through to someone and all they can tell me is basically 'sorry we've tried to deliver but looks like for some reason they couldn't so just wait and see'. Look I get things are busy, I understand the situation we're in right now but this is just down right unacceptable. I would honestly give them 0 stars if I could because there has not been a single part of this delivery service that has been good.
If possible I highly recommend using any other delivery or courier service. I've never had issues to this degree with any other shipping companies in the past."
"Same review as the hundreds below, these clowns received my order Nov. 30th it then left Montreal but missed delivery whatever the f@ck that actually means?, then took 4 days to arrive at the Toronto sorting facility of doom which is 4 hours away where upon it appears to have disappeared up Poopalators a$$hole. Contacted customer services 3 times it takes almost an hour to get through and routes through to India meaning you’re faced with a robotic scripted advisor that has zero knowledge of the order the item or what day even year it is. Finally received an email from some monkey addressing himself as Tracing specialist which basically said “I’m looking into this, goodbye”.

It’s now 10th Dec. the item is still apparently at the Toronto sorting facility there’s been no further update no further correspondence from the tracing specialist, perhaps he’s got lost in the sorting facility too?

All in all an absolute joke, how these guys are still trading and why reputable retailers are using them is beyond me. Next time instead of ordering an item online I’ll write a letter to Santa at least you know where it’s coming from and when it’s getting delivered.

Avoid these guys at all costs!

Just to update on this already shambolic situation I thought I’d try customer service one last time and actually got through to a Canadian speaking man, he has now told me that the backlog at the doomed Toronto facility are working their way through 22 unloaded trailers *great* then went on to tell me that once unloaded sorted and loaded my item will then go on to the Guelph depot they have a backlog of 18 trailers and it will then need to be unloaded sorted and loaded again to get to me in New Hamburg

You just really can’t write this sh@t, one item 3 depots and at this rate probably no delivery.

Absolutely useless the worst of the worst, should not be operating."
Left a note and sent me to the wrong pickup location. Says online that they tried to contact me but never got any calls or emails. Forced to use Purolator several times and never have had a good experience. Not buying from any retailers who continue to use this trash service
Was home all day. Never even came to the house. Got a message that my parcel was taken to Stratford shipping area for pickup. I don't even live in Stratford. I'm 50km. away from there and don't drive. Very poor !!!!
"Worst shipping company ever. Driver just passed through our house and didn't leave any notice at all. Now I don't know where my package is. The site doesn't update live, and notifications in your email doesn't get sent in time. Why do we need to deal with bull?"
"Garbage Service. I was unavailable when they try to deliver my package so they took it back without leaving any note or a call. I received an email later which say a note will be available at the door with pickup details (nothing I can find). When I called to confirm (that call was on hold for 40 minutes), they said they have no idea where the box it at the moment. I did request a re-delivery and they have no idea when they will be coming to deliver it but want me to be home so I can sign the paper.
Useless people, either leave the package at the door or if you really want a signature then at least give me a time when you are coming to deliver it. Above that when I asked where the package is so I can pick it, they also do not have any idea where it is.

Bunch of morons running a company like this. Save your time, use UPS, FedEx or Canada Post cause these morons have no idea what they are doing."
"Worst courier company ever. Not sure how they deal with all the shipments they do not deliver. I saw some 5-star good reviews, but I think they are fake too. Do not bother calling; nobody answers anyway. I hope they go out of business soon so we can get our packages on time."
Item shipped out on Dec 2nd.. no updates whatsoever on what happened to my package and it has been a week. The only update I got was my package is delayed due to weather. What a joke.
"I know there are a lot of bad reviews on Purolator, and I was reluctant to use them. However, I sent a package off to Alberta, over night, Fort MacLeod. It was Christmas baking for my 80 year uncle, so I wanted it to get there fast. The woman that did the transaction, said they cannot guarantee it, but we will do our best. Our best?? I got a call the next day (23 hours later) from my uncle and it had arrived! Thanks Purolator!! Great Job.. not to mention above excellent friendly customer service! :) I think her name is Wendy, at the customer service desk at the main warehouse in Port Kells (92a)
Thanks again!! Merry Christmas."
This company is a JOKE. How are they still working! They need to be out of business like now. The most hilarious thing about this scam of a delivery company is the fact that you CAN’T even contact them. One number and I have waited for over 30 minutes and decided to hang up because of no answer.
"My package is not moving since two days but it is in the same city, and I have no ways to pickup the package myself or to contact them since all the numbers provided don't even ring, even the chat says no agents are available, I don't know what to do. I'm thinking of cancelling my order and get my money back."
I think they don't even delivery...
Do i even need to add my name? 3000+ reviews already speak for itself buy my $550 package has been lost for 5 days as of today and Purolator has no answer except for giving you the run around story. Their agents and even managers keep ignoring your complaints. I currently have no idea where my sold out item is and whether i will ever see it again and yet Purolator refuses to compensate me for my loss!
"My god Puralator is utter trash service.

1) Learn my brand new Spin Bike SITTING OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT. My 60 year old neighbor had to drag it in for me.

2) JUST LEFT A BRAND NEW 60” TV OUTSIDE MY PARENTS. IN.THE.RAIN.

Someone has to do something about these guys!!!!"
"There were no attempts at notifying us of the delivery and no attempts at ringing the buzzer. It said that there was no entry code provided even though our apartment building does not require an entry code. This is the second time it has happened. The first time, it was said that there was no receiver even though there were 3 people inside the house, and no attempts at ringing the buzzer or alerting us was made. We had to pick up the package over a 40 minute drive across the city. Both times, a phone number was provided as an alternative way of alerting us of the delivery, though I never received a phone call. Very disappointed of the service provided by Purolator. I will be wary of ordering online next time if I know that the courier is Purolator."
"Ordered some supplements from a company in the U.K. which sometimes utilizes Purolator. I was provided with a tracking number that provides me with absolutely NO information.
I have been checking back every few days (it has been approximately 4-5 days) and all it says is ""picked up at shipper's origin location"" and ""in transit""; however, there is NO information about where my package departed and where it currently is.

By far the worst delivery service on this planet. What use is a tracking number if you can't even track your package?"
"Out of last 5 Purolator deliveries through Amazon, they've;
1. Completely lost package ( been 5 weeks and counting when package was only 3 hours away)
2. Changed guaranteed delivery time on THREE ORDERS so that they could take and extra 1-7 days (defaulting Amazon's 2 day delivery, which needed Amazon's intercession to correct the situation and they were still late twice)
3. ACTUALLY BROKE the door handle on my exterior aluminum door forcing it open when it was locked EVEN THOUGH INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO LEAVE IT BY BACK DOOR.

AND COMPANIES KEEP USING THEIR SERVICES!!!!"
"My package is shipping from Toronto, says they picked up up on 30 Nov. Still sitting at the sorting facility with the ""Delayed due to weather"" that was only added yesterday after they responded to my email asking when they would begin actually shipping me my package. Seems like if they miss your package on one day they push it to the bottom of the pile and ship it when someone realizes it wasn't sent out.

Update to this, they said it won't arrive until 22 Dec and that it may even be later than that. That's almost a month for me to get my package, I know they're busy this time of year but there's no way a delivery that usually takes 5 days is now taking them 1 month.

Maybe they should take their own advice and read their own article on ""The High Cost of Poor Customer Service""."
"There's nothing else to be said that has not already been said. Clearly they are a 0 out of 5 stars.

They are now outright lying saying: ""Weather delay - service will resume, weather permitting""

Asides from the fact that there are 0 weather issues. Their service is utter trash, nothing they can do, and if you request to pick up your package to speed things up they offer you at least 3-5 business days in delay before its ready for pick up!

Unsure why they are still being used as a shipment method, nor why they are in business - as they clearly do not want to be in it."
Mind boggling how this company can still be in business!
"I was waiting for 2 Deliveries in 3 days. The first one was left for the wrong unit (one of my neighbours tracked my name on the interphone to find me). The second one, the driver did not even try, he just put a notice of passage on the door and left... I was waiting at home and saw the update on the website. Now I need to go to pick up my shipment by myself, and I can't drive. Thanks, Purolator."
"if i could 0 stars i would. I dont believe they are actually able to deliver anything. hoping they go out of business soon enough. they cant even be contacted via phone.. I've been on hold for 40 mins for the past 4 days then just gave up. Wish I would have crossed the border myself and picked my package by car, would have been easier"
Package has not moved a city over for a week. Package ordered a day after from the US had been delivered already.
"This has been the worst WORST service I have ever encountered. They make absolutely no attempts to deliver or even use a buzzer!
I have lost my week’s wage due to their incompetence in not delivering the packages.
I have not had a solution for the issue. Gave them my address and were incapable to deliver. Then gave them another address to make things easier for them and nothing !
It is ridiculous to say that they could not deliver because I was not home as I am in quarantine and am unable to go out!!
This is so frustrating!
Does anyone know who to contact ? At this point I am loosing my daily wage due to their failure to deliver my work materials !! Please has someone been able to actually get their package ?
They won’t even give me a pick up place"
"Worst company I've EVER dealt with anywhere. I live in Victoria, BC, we have great weather and my package is 'delayed due to weather'? So laughable. When I called the sort center, I got some kid with attitude who couldn't have cared less about my issue. Now I've been on hold with the same 5 second loop of the worst music ever for nearly an hour. I will NEVER use this service and will never buy from merchants who use them either. This company needs to go bankrupt."
"Terrible experience with this company. Honestly don't know how they remain in business. Calling their number, you are presented with the same lame excuses starting a week ago. I've been calling all day and yet to talk to anyone. Shipment arrived here in London a week ago and tracking says ""arrived at sort facility"" 3 times yet no updates and no delivery date. I had one last week around Wed. But nothing now."
"Delays and delays. I don't mind that considering the current situation. But at least keep the tracking up to date. The system almost never updates and is very vague. Just be straight and clients will at least appreciate it. Don't give me another ""it's a pandemic, sorry"". The pandemic is worldwide yet Purolator is the only one that uses it over and over as an excuse for awful/terrible/pukeworthy service."
"Yet another FALSE ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"" stunt.
Was at home all day, have security camera facing front door, was able to triple check no delivery was ""attempted"" .
Can't even count how many times this terrible company lied about ""attempted deliveries"".
Shame on you Purolator."
"Just keeps using weather as an excuse. There is not even a single cloud in the sky,no snow on the roads. How can the weather delay your service for over 1 week? and I still haven't received my item so I don't know how long more I'll have to wait..."
"Worst Courrier possible. I have had at least 15 packages delivered with them this year, and every single one arrives at my cities sort facility and then goes out for delivery everyday for over a week and never gets delivered. No option to pick up the package, and no help from customer service. So pathetic"
"I am expecting delivery of an Amazon phone case through Purolator. My tracking information indicates that my package,which has arrived in my city's sorting facility, will be delayed due to ""weather"". It was sunny and 0°c here today, so ""weather"" my rear."
Nothing but issues with Purolator. They used to be pretty reliable when my work place used them but now they are unreliable. I have been waiting days past by my delivery date and they keep coming up with different excuses. The first excuse was “delay due to weather”. The city it was being shipped out of and delivered to has great sunny weather right now. The latest update says the delivery date is unknown and that it’s “delayed in transit”. I am waiting on a time sensitive package and everyday that passes I am being charged money. Beyond frustrating. I received a package from UPS that wasn’t even on priority and they still delivered it 3 business days early.
horrible delivery delays. I will stop ordering from companies who uses purolator.
"I went to check the tracking for a parcel and saw that they had ""attempted delivery"" the last 3 days and determined ""receiver was unavailable"". They have my cell phone number to contact me but never did once. Why did they keep coming back for 3 days knowing they would get the same result? Why not just contact me after the first delivery attempt? I tried calling multiple times a day every day and waited 45 mins each time and never got connected to an agent. Then they call my cell at 8pm on a Friday when I'm not near my phone and leave a message saying the address is wrong and leads them to a building that's under construction and isn't in use. However my address is correct under the tracking details on their website...Seriously a waste of time. Why are they SO hard to get a hold of?!?!? Virtual assistance is useless. Worst customer experience so far.."
"Tracking said unable to deliver due to bad weather, I live 10km from the sorting center and the weather was perfect. Don't use this service."
"THE WORST DELIVERY EVER!!!
They lie, they don't deliver on time, they just keep postponing the delivery!!
I will never ever even recommend it to my worst enemies...
It's just unbelievably trash!!
Just sell the company plz"
"Purolator is the absolute worst. I've had the experience of waiting for a large package from Amazon (75 inch TV) and seeing the tracker on their site go from ""out for delivery"" to ""failed delivery /receiver not available""

Looked out the window of my apartment to see the truck just drive down, turn around and leave again. The guy didn't even get out of his truck to attempt delivery.

This happened to me twice. I contacted within 10 minutes of seeing the updates / notifications, they said next delivery needs to be rescheduled and can not guarantee. I have then decided to cancel the order with Amazon."
"What has happened to customer service? Purolator was unable to deliver a package to a condo complex located at one of London's busiest intersections. The driver either was at the wrong address or didn't even attempt. No door tag, no missed call, no Purolator period. When Rogers asked them to redeliver they left it at the facility and wouldn't deliver it. I am disabled and unable to leave the house, this is how we get treated. I had to cancel the order, it was a gift for a friend. Thanks for putting a damper on my Christmas. Be aware, don't shop if they ship with Purolator. Also, Purolator has blocked their phone numbers, you can't even reach them, it hangs up after the overcapacity recording. What if someone was unable to get to the internet? Horrible."
"Package has been on vehicle out for delivery for over a week! Worst delivery service. They opened ""investigation"", haven't heard back. Package has a new phone upgrade, was supposed to be birthday gift now is late."
This is the most ridiculous experience I’ve ever had with a shipping company it’s not even tracking it’s said on route for 3 days now and I tried to go text a person but instead i got a bot who was the most clueless thing ever god this is the worst company I spent 400$ and they can’t even tel me when my package is gonna be here. I would get a full refund if I could but there so oblivious there customer service is garbage DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU DONT WANT YOUR PACKAGE ACTUALLY DELIVERED. Everyday they come up with another excuse the one yesterday was “weather related delay” yesterday it was beautiful outside today it was “traffic” it’s been 8 hours since that was said and it still says that do not order from this company. If someone could help me please let me know thanks
It’s been 6 days since I was supposed to receive my package. They updated me that it was out for delivery everyday since the day I was supposed to receive it then they updated me saying “Appointment required for delivery due to pandemic” I called them and they had no clue what I was talking about and said I would receive the package the next day. Still waiting ...
"Waiting for a PC delivery. Estimated date of delivery was Dec. 15, after ordering on Nov. 12. Long estimated time, but on Nov. 26 I get a notification saying my item has been shipped, BUT what they really meant was ""a shipping label has been created"" which means NOTHING. Scheduled delivery for Dec. 1 and the day goes by with nothing. Wake-up the next day to a weather delay, weird, no weather in that city or the road between me and there, called to ask and they say its because of covid, but don't worry, my package will be there THE NEXT DAY GUARANTEED. Next day rolls by, no package, I call back and they say the same thing. Repeat the next day, and the day after here I am, no package and on hold with this truly atrocious company. Anyone working for them should be ashamed."
Today is Friday. I was notified my package arrived at local Purolator sorting facility on Monday at 0638 hrs. Said next business day delivery. Never heard from them since and no tracking update. 45 min wait on phone and never connected. Will never use them in future.
Incompetent can't even begin to describe these people. My package disappeared into thin air and they won't even let you contact customer support about it. How are they in business? I'd give zero stars if I could.
"Worst company ever!

I ordered from the American Eagle a month ago. It was in Ottawa two days after I made the order. and for almost a month they trying to deliver it. I called and ask to leave it at pick up location, they told they will and it should be there next day. I waited two just in case. Guess what! It was not there. Called again. New lady assured me that package will be there next day. I gave 4 days this time just in acse! Guess what - still not there! I'm speechless! Dear companies please stop using Purolator! It's disrespectful to your customers!"
"Ordered a package that came from Vancouver. Estimated delivery 2 days from purchase. Took less than a day to get from Vancouver to the Calgary sorting facility right on!. Realized the address was wrong, but was only a couple houses over so I figured since I wasn't doing anything I'd just intercept it, show my ID and all would be good (it was already out for delivery). Called to see if they had a time estimate so I wouldn't have to make the neibours nervous sitting in front of their house all day. They cancelled the delivery immediately before I could even finish my sentance and sent it back to the facility to get a new label.... Took over a week to put a new label on it. It can cross provinces in under 12 hours but takes 7+ days to put a new label on and deliver it >100km. Just disgusting. This is government efficiency for you."
One of the worst services in Canada. This line should be enough for you to understand their service and USELESS website.
"I will be so grateful if the delivery man just put the package at the nearby site and stop traveling around the world with it and pretend to delivery, so I can just pick up by myself 3 days ago."
"If only I could give this company minus 2000!!! You should be able to allow us to rate minus when a company is the worst of the worst! 2 times I have been delivered with Purolator and 2 times it has been a nightmare to receive my package! They do not respect the schedule delivery! I am saying that they will change it daily and they think you have nothing else to do than waiting for them!!! Their employees are rude! Worst experience ever! Vendors should hold them accountable for the bad service they are giving for real! I never had issues with other companies. I wonder where is the management? Do they see these bad ratings about their company? I am disgusted with this company! Customer service is terrible! Drivers are liars! From now on if I purchase something online my first question will be, do you deliver with Puralator? If yes then, I rather pay more and change it ASAP cause it is not worth the headaches."
Worst courier services in Canada. Always delay in delivery even for local in same city. Same experience more than 5 times.
Purolator please stop asking me for my address correction because you couldn't get in by buzzer resulting in further delay of each package. I had to contact you guys every single time a package is shipped through you guys to update my address. Is there no possible way that my address isn't saved in your system to stop this from happening for the fifth time? Why is it always just Purolator that I have this issue with? Why is it against your morals to call cellphone numbers?
"Express Post would of been faster. This was my first and last time using Purolator. I know there apart of Canada Post as both have the same terrible service. I thought I should use Purolator because I was late ordering my Medication, I did not want to run out and suffer. Well my mistake, If I would of used my regular service I would have my Medication, now I'm still waiting after 3 days for next day delivery. I don't recommend Purolator If you want your Package on time..."
"They sent my package to a really far pickup point, even though there are several in my area. WHY?"
"I reached out because there was a delay in having my Rogers internet delivered. I work from home so the timeline they promised was pretty critical and why I chose to go with them. After 2 days in a row of delays and two days not being able to work I contacted customer support via the chat. The agent (Linda G) was extremely rude and unhelpful. I asked to speak with a manager 4 times in the conversation. She never passed me to a manager and eventually ended the chat without providing any assistance. All I got was continued repetitive responses saying ""due to high volumes the delivery might be delayed check the website for updates on tracking"". My next step will be to also post this on Roger's reviews because they chose this company for shipping and they should know this is how their customers are being treated. Maybe they will go with another company for future shipments."
"How is this company still in business? I see the truck pull up and as I'm walking to the door I can see the guy, not even bother getting close, tosses my package 15 feet through the air to land on my concrete porch. Before I can even get out to complain, he's gone. Sure enough, I open the package and the birthday present I had ordered for my daughter is now broken. They don't care about their service, so I don't know why anyone still uses them. So pissed off I could cry!"
I bought a device from TSC and their shipping department missed adding the apartment #. I called Purolator as soon as I noticed it. A nice lady took the called and told me it was fixed however for three consecutive days my package has not been delivered due to the same issue. I have called / chat 6 times already and every time I get a different answer... finally today someone says the system will be updated at 10am and it's going to take another 3 days... also I had to give them a code access to the building which we don use... it looks like it's too hard for the delivery guy ring the bell ....
"Package missed sorted? for 5 days. Called the service number spoke with a very helpful Woman who stated that the package should arrive today. My wife and I were home all day checked email saw a message that the package was delivered and left at my front door. Checked outside my door no package. Called Purolator and was told package was delivered and left outside the door. I files a claim. Next day I discovered that my package was left in my rural mail box up the road 1/2km from my house. Received an email from Purolator 5 days later that my claim was denied because their GPS tracking system showed the driver went to my address. I replied to the email stating I found the package in my mail box which isn't close to my house and which I can't see from my front door. I suggested that it would have been helpful if the tracking message would have stated the package was left in Mail Box, This would have saved time and aggravation. Don't know how the GPS works I suspect if it shows the driver is on your street and went to your house. I don't enjoy filing these comments and didn't 2 years ago when a BBQ was left at the business up the street. I believe based on the complaints and common theme about service that Management should address this problem ASAP.
Never have issues with the other carriers or couriers
If I had a choice I would select anyone else other than Purolator. When I have met the Purolator drivers I have always found them to be good people so I am at a loss as to what is going on"
"Item was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago and now it says there is no ETA on when I will receive my package. Now the tracking information says:

Estimated Delivery Date
Not Available
Delayed due to missed delivery"
"Worst company ever. What’s point of paying when I don’t my item delivered.. I asked for the delivery not a pick up... Calls for customer service taking hours, makes me wonder if there’s even a customer service department in this company. Don’t know how they still exist, they gotta close down for real"
"We were home waiting for the delivery and, without even ringing the bell, driver leaves the ""delivery was attempted"" sticky note and runs away before we can stop him.
Why is Purolator famous for doing this?"
"Just terrible customer service, Long waits on calls, and no real resolutions. Be smart and use fed ex"
"They should buy a Lock and close there delivery service.
Whenever i order anything online i just pray to god it’s better to not get deliver then package to be delivered by Purolator.
Why you guys even do this much effort to leave slip. Never even make effort to try buzzer. Why you guys waste gas on roaming and fake delivery. Just give us call we will come to your store and pickup the stuff.. don’t worry about delivery man!! You just relax and smoke weed."
"Worst courier service ever I have seen. You don’t bother calling on buzzer or calling phone. You just stick the slip outside and expect us to go to your office while we wrote all the instructions. What is the point of me ordering online when I have to go out.
Now you put my parcel in open and I found it open boxed. People took out stuff from it. What is this going on ???"
"Unlike every single other shipping company, Purolator won't deliver to my postcode, they won't say why beyond 'their drivers dont like the road', so all items I order off Amazon get taken to their office in the centre of town which I can't get to, and then sent to landfill if I understand Amazon's 'returns' process. Why Amazon uses Purolator is beyond me. They are a bit of a joke from all accounts."
"I wish I could give 0 stars. There is no accountability to a scheduled date and their customer service is very quick to dismiss helping or even trying to help. Knowing a package is coming on Purolator just get ready for a headache trying to receive it. Your tracking will change from on a truck to ""missed delivery"" for several days and they couldn't care less."
This by far the worst shipper in Canada. For the second time in a row Purolater has no idea when or where my shipments are. They are totally incompetent and I personally would never use them in the future.
"I absolutely hate receiving my packages from Purolator!!!! I stayed home all day knowing it was arriving. At around 3:30 I had to leave the house and when I opened the door the package was there. What does it take to ring the doorbell and leave?? I had very expensive merchandise and anyone could have taken it. I’m expecting another box from Puro, and hopefully this experience will be better, but I doubt it because you honestly suck. Clearly I didn’t select Purolator as the carrier and I know for sure I never will."
"I absolutly hate getting my packages by Purolator. We live in apartment building with no buzzer. I've put in a note with Purolator stating to call me upon delivery and I put a note outside the door pleading with them to call me when they get here because it's such a hassle to get it at a Purolator drop off center ( I work Monday to Friday 10-6 and don't get home until 8ish so their closed) no one ever calls me so I can get my hubby to just come down stairs. If I could, I would never use Purolator."
"Yet again Purolator fails to deliver our Amazon order to our home. Yet they DID have time to drive an extra 40km to drop it off at a collection point!!??
If only there was a Zero star on here they'd get it....."
"Delivery truck passed in front of my home. I ran to open the door and he went without stopping by looking at my home. I saw him. Then I received an email saying my package was delivered at the front door !! I called the customer service to explain this problem and they said within 48 hours someone will contact me. Day later, my neighbor rang my bell with the box in his hands , my unit number was crossed out with a pen and wrote another unit number and the box was left on my neighbor's neighbor empty unit's door !! Since more than 48 hours had passed and still nobody contacted me . TERRIBLE !! I will ask next time ,when I shop , if they said they will send with Purolator , I will not buy or ask to be sent with Fedex. Please be aware, they are not honest towards their customer . ZERO STAR"
"This is the worst company ever, placed an order on-line and it's been a week that my parcel is at the Toronto sorting center with no delivery date. Don't know what the issue is, but it shouldn't take a week for your parcel to arrive, I will wait another day before calling them, but I know that I will get the turn around. Avoid at all cost."
"(My incident was on the day of Nov 27, Medicine Hat Alberta 2020) Deserves 0 stars because of the absolute laziness and Pi$$ poor customer service from the delivery drivers. They lie when they say they attempted delivery, I was home all day monitoring the tracking. They didn't knock, ring the door, hell they Never even drove to my house !!! They have the audacity to frame the customer as the bad guy who missed the delivery when in fact i was at home all day but again they are famous for writing slips and not dropping of the package by reading the reviews online. Incompetent workers including the company need to be eliminated entirely."
Never send your package through purolator it's been a week haven't picked up my parcel yet everyday I call them and wait for a 1 hour to talk with someone then they just say will pickup tomorrow
"I ordered packages to get delivered and I used my tracking number to see where they were. They said that they got delivered by Purolator but there were no packages on my veranda and no one knocked on my door. I have absolutely NO idea where my packages are right now.
This needs to be fixed."
"The Purolator driver NEVER attempts to deliver to the package to us- I know this because we are always home with an ill family member. There is Always the condo buzzer code on the delivery notice and it is never used- The slip is slapped on the building door and I receive a text that my package has been rerouted when I am here, right at home- it is sent miles and miles away- This deserves someone not being their delivery driver in Coquitlam/Burquitlam area"
"They mark my item: Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable. BUT I am home all day to wait for the package. I call them immediately to report this. They said they will re-schedule to tomorrow. Then I nothing happened. I call them again. They said the did re-scheduled. BUT re-schedule does NOT mean re-deliver the package. I need wait for re-deliver. Also, they cannot give me a confirmed date when they will re-deliver. Just ask me sign up for notification and wait for update."
"Still haven't received it!!
Last scan was 8:44am yesterday (nov 28) at Brackley rd, PEI depot, literally 2 mins down the road from me..states yesterday, on truck for delivery...but guess what...still no package!!! Just spent 45mins on phone, tried to tell me not till Monday now...nope..nope.. so now I'm waiting to hear back. Was told they r sending an email to depot (which is closed, but 2 people r there sorting) Dont hear back within an hour, I will b going to this depot n knocking till someone answers!!!so pissed off right now. FYI..pkg is from grand kids to my dying father!!!
Sent Nov 24th, pd$125 for next day. Im furious right now!!"
"So where to start. I ordered a PC for myself. From Newegg. Super excited to play on it, I clicked Express on checkout. Yeah no problem taking your money there. They promised me delivery on Wednesday. Guess when I got it? Still waiting! More than a week of placing my order. What a terrible service to use. My first and last time. I wish I knew what I was getting myself into. So much for enjoying a gift that I was supposed to have before the weekend. You know it’s so unprofessional to make people wait like this, it’s appalling how disorganized your staff is. If I could give -stars, I would Max -5. What about people with birthdays or Christmas for the kids. I understand delays due to Covid-19. But 4 days late. 5 days late. Bruh."
"If you have the choice to have your item delivered by dogsled or Purolator pick the dogsled as at least there is a chance you'll get your item.

The customer service reps seem nice but will say anything to get you off the phone. They will lie and promise they will look into it but at the end of the day they just waste your time.

So dont even bother reaching out on the phone, chat, twitter, or whatever email the rep posts under this review. Ether you get your items (ya right) or you dont. May the odds be in your favor.

Here is my current situation:

I was supposed to have a bed frame delivered, I missed the first attempt on Nov 23rd (was in a meeting and phone was on silent, so my fault no worries). The next day it was on the truck for delivery, I waited for it and at 5:40pm they said it was too heavy and didnt bother to even try to drop it off. I was home all day and could have done it myself. The information on the tracking said to call and schedule a delivery date. I called in and confirmed a delivery date of Nov 26 and took the day off work to accommodate.

When I checked the status on Thursday Nov 26 it hadn't moved since Wednesday morning, I again called and the CSR said they lost it and it wont be delivered. How they were able to lose what they claim is a large and heavy item is beyond me.

They somehow found it on Friday and it was on the truck for delivery when seconds later they said there was no buzzer and it wont be delivered. Weird as the first driver was able to call my buzzer. Once again I called the CSR and she promised me it would go out and she put a request in to have it delivered.

If you guessed that it wasn't delivered on Friday (the 27th) you are correct. So now we are over a week into what should have been a 3 day delivery (it was coming from Oakville going to Mississauga)

Why amazon still uses this hack of a company is beyond me.

Avoid this company and encourage any business you deal with to do the same."
"3,000 negative reviews and counting – when will it end? Once again, I ordered a product on the web and had no choice but to get it delivered by Purolator. Their website stated that I was supposed to get my product delivered today. Then, the website said Purolator randomly sent my product back to its original sorting facility (Toronto) and stated that it will only be delivered in 4-7 days from now. Called the customer service and they read back the website to me. No explanation for the incompetence, just that my product bounced back between Montreal and Toronto sorting facilities for no good/apparent reason. I deal all the time with FedEx and never hear such excuses: they just deliver things on time and as promised. HERE IT IS FOLKS: you can see from the number of negative reviews below (and copy/pasted “I’m sorry to hear …” responses from customer service) that Purolator view us all as “chumps”. I will do my part to address this unethical behavior by requesting a refund from companies that use Purolator because of their horrible delivery record. We all have a contract with the companies that sell us a product, and Purolator voids that contract when it fails to provide the product according to the terms of the contract. Let's end this charade once and for all!"
"Worse customer service ever.

It's the same thing everytime I order something from Amazon. When I order a package it says it will be delivered by puralator, I wait for the package the whole day and then I get a email from amazon saying ""puralator tried To deliver your package"". My eyes have been glued to my camera all day waiting for the package and I get no phonecall or text saying that the package is outside. There's no paper outside saying that there was a delivery attempt. It's like they don't even leave their truck and they just scan the package saying there was an attempted delivery so they can be home by 4:30. I don't even know why Amazon is using such a crappy company to deliver their packages.

I've been waiting for my package for the whole day. The website said at 8am that my package was on the vehicle, I waited the whole day and at 6pm it tells me ""Delayed due to current pandemic disruption""? It was in the vehicle? How does the pandemic have to do with that? Does the driver have the virus? It doesn't even specify."
"The worst delivery and customer service ever. I called the number and the customer service representative didn't know where and what happened to my package. I received a slip for pick up at a postnet location, I arrived there and they did not have my package. I was advised to call Purolator's number and like what I mentioned, no one knows what happened to it and they can't even trace it. Am I going to get my package at all? Or was it stolen already by the delivery person? I need answers."
"Why is Purolator still a thing? I was up the street, helping a neighbour shovel snow when Purolator struck again. Their driver made no attempt at delivery and stuck a notice on my front door. Without attempting to even knock. I don’t even know if my package was on the truck. I called out to him but he ignored me while he scurried to his truck and drove off. Why??? Are they in a race to the bottom?"
"Stay a way from them! This company is the worst. They don’t deserve even one star. I do my shopping online, every time when I have to deal with purolator is a nightmare. This time I have updated my address twice! before my parcel arrived in terminal. In the end there was notification “incorrect address-no entry code”. What is wrong with them?? The parcel was on it’s way on Thursday morning because of no entry code (which I had provided twice!) parcel will be delivered on Monday. 🤬 No matter what you do they will mess up your shipment"
Worst customer service ever. They always delay the orders and do not even provide substantial information about the whereabouts. Email tracking is ugliest. You get a notification about OUT FOR DELIVERY when it has been shipped and you are already using it.
"Use the service 4 years ago, I was a horrible experience, I tried to avoid using it until recently, had to purchase something from Dell, the experience was even worse. It seems they never try to improve their service, why bother to use it again. I made a decision, as long as the merchandise ship with Purolator, I will never buy from them again."

I received notice that the package was on the truck for delivery. When it didn’t arrive I checked again and it said that the road was closed. I called this morning to find out why it was not delivered and I was told that the truck got stuck. I asked if it was on the truck for delivery. I was told no. I said why not? She said she did not know. I said will it be out for delivery tomorrow? She said that she would send it on the truck tomorrow. When I checked the status online it says that the parcel can be picked up at their location. As far as I am concerned it should have been on the truck today. It is not my fault the vehicle got stuck. Not at all impressed.

"WORST DELIVERY COMPANY!!! When there’s a delivery date they don’t deliver then never update the shipments. Been waiting at home for 3 DAYS!! It’s 3 days behind no updates, back to sitting at their sorting facility in the same city as I am. Now I placed another order through Amazon and Amazon has always been reliable but this time they chose to go with Purolator so now I’ve got two shipments in Purolator purgatory that I’ll never receive. Next time I order if I see it’s handled by this terrible company I’ll immediately cancel the order. No point since I’ll NEVER receive it. DO NOT do business with them."

Useless company. It makes no sense why Purolator drivers don't have cell phones they can use to call when they are outside. This is the only shipping company I've ever had issues with them leaving things in our strata mailroom. Some of the most incompetent people around.

By far the worst delivery service to use. Twice now they said they attempted delivery and receiver and as unavailable when I was home both times all day. They didn’t even leave a note on my door on where to pick up or anything. I had to call purolator to see where my package was as I still haven’t received it. The said it was ready for pick up at their facility which they then proceeded to tell me the location. It wasn’t even in my city!!! I then asked for it to be rerouted to a closet pick up area near me. I called my local parcel place they had it sitting there for pick up when I searched my tracking number it said it was in the truck for delivery again! What a mess these guys are. I hope I never ever have to deal with purolator in the future!

"Every single time Amazon has used Purolator for a delivery I don't get my order in time. Most recently my package was scheduled for next day delivery (Sunday). I provided both my buzzer code and phone number to Purolator. I was home all day and received no buzz or call. Purolator delivery person stated ""delivery attempted - receiver not found"". I called customer service and they assured me my package would come on Tuesday. It did not. Customer service once again assured me it would arrive on Wednesday(today). I talked to customer service again because tracking shows it hasn't been shipped. Now I'm being told it will ship Thursday(tomorrow)...

This is absurd and unacceptable. Purolator consistently botches and delays orders and offers no compensations or guarantees. I've never in my life been so consistently let down by a company and because Amazon uses them I have no choice but to suffer with their incompetence."

"So purolator always dumps my parcel in the lobby of my apartment. Then of course, it gets stolen. On the package I have given instructions to buzz me ( the key panel at the door to let someone in) and I will come down. This NEVER happens. I have already lost 5 parcels.

This time I called dispatch, I said “send a message to the delivery guy to buzz me and I will come down. “ No problem she says...I have paged him with your instructions.

Weeeeelllllllllll, guess what, he came and dumped the parcel in the lobby, he did not buzz me and now it’s gone.
I feel it’s a lost cause :0(

NOTE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE PLEASE PLEASE Please!!!!! Do not post a follow up comment about calling purolator. I HAVE DONE THIS 5 times already...thank you"

"Worst service ever. Ordered birthday gift for my son to deliver through Purolator on Nov 16th which they didn't. First excuse was that they ""didn't know which suite was mine"", then the next they ""didn't know the buzz code"" and then no response at all. When we called the customer care, they just told that we will get an email about the delivery date. Today is Nov 23rd 10pm, and I haven't got the package yet! This is the same story even at work. Every time a package comes through Purolator, it gets delayed by at least 6-7 days - every time! Absolutely the worst service ever!"

"I was supposed to receive a parcel on Nov 19. The status said Delivery not attempted, usually due to driver running out of time on route. It was rescheduled for Nov 20 and the driver ran out of time again. Today Nov 23 it was still not delivered. Today I spoke to a Service Rep and found out that new parcels take priority over parcels that Purolator missed the delivery date. So therefore my parcel is no longer important and if the driver keeps running out of time I might never get my parcel. Makes no sense to me. You would think that if they missed the delivery date they would delivery it the next morning to make clients happy. I have sent an email to Customer Care and waiting for a positive resolution."

"I understand that it is pandemic, however 1st the package is delayed 4-7 days. That is fine, I understand its large but when it was left this morning. It was left in a open spot not even close to porch and there was a car in laneway yet no one knocked. Just dropped the large package in lane way and ran. My mother who was in living room had seen the truck and in a matter of going to the side door (maybe a few seconds) he was gone. Usually packages are delivered to the front porch in the past by Purolator, however not this time!! Not impressed!!"

"Yet again, I'm disgusted by Purolator, or 'sooner-or-later' as it should be called. Missed a delivery attempt, called to get it rescheduled. The dude marked the tracking slip as having tried to deliver at 11:55 p.m. and the operator said no, he attempted at 11:55 a.m. so the guy was scamming Purolator for overtime! The driver didn't bother to try and redeliver, just said he did even though I was home the whole day and takes it to a pick up place that is now closed due to covid lock-down. Bravo jerks! I have to call the place I bought this Christmas present for my mother-in-law from and say it's being sent back to them and can I have my money back. Please check a company's shipping details before you buy and never get anything from anyone who uses Purolator."

"Absolutely Trash Company, no communication or organization. I was informed a package would be delivered on a Friday, and received another notice shortly after saying delivery attempt was failed. Contacted customer service and arranged for a redelivery the following Monday and made sure they had my building buzz code to leave it on my doorstep. Sunday morning, I receive the same notice of delivery. I watched the Purolator truck pull into my lot, do a U-Turn and leave without trying to make the delivery. Moments later I got another failed delivery notice. No delivery attempt was even made, and they did not stick with the arrangements made directly with customer support! Can't believe I paid for this service. You are better off driving yourself to pick up the item yourself, and you will probably spend less on gas anyways. Canada Post is a much better option to go with. This company does not attempt to make deliveries, they do not take their jobs seriously. Do not order delivery services through Purolator!!!"

"Purolator is absolutely awful, their tracking system is either never on point or they simply don't ship your package. I ordered something from amazon 10 days ago and it was supposed to get here on Tuesday yet it has been on the shipping label created a page for the past five days and I'm still waiting for it to be picked up. Next time I order something and see that it's being shipped by Purolator, I'll just cancel my order and buy from someone else."

"I was notified by email that my package was ""out for delivery"" on Thursday, Nov 19. It didn't come.

I got another email on Friday, Nov 20 that my package was ""out for delivery"". It didn't come.

I phoned their customer service number and they shrugged it off by saying it would be delivered Monday. I'm pretty skeptical seeing they are 0 for 2 so far.

I would have thought that if you missed a delivery date then it would have priority for the next day. Again, apparently not.

This is their business. Unbelievable."

"We've waited for our Purolator delivery for 3 days. They keep rejecting the address which actually has nothing wrong with it. We called and opted for pick up instead and even went to the depo hoping to claim the package yesterday. The customer service rep said we can pick up today at 1:15 pm but to my surprised I saw this note on my door saying ""We're sorry we missed you"" I am in my living room or close by during the time written on the note, if the driver knocks the door I will definitely hear it. Also, why was the package delivered when we already opted to pick it up. Now the note says pick up on Monday, 11/23!!! This is crazy!!! Are you intentionally rejecting the address and leaving sorry we missed you note to buy time for your backlogs? I read a lot of blogs about your service and your drivers don't even attempt to knock on the door and just swipe sorry notes and leave. 3,000+ reviews and 95% are bad. This is a true reflection of how terrible your delivery service is."
"Hello Arris,

Thank you for your review, we truly appreciate your feedback. The depot is working on having your item held for pick-up. As soon as this is ready the tracking will update to show it's available. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Purolator used to be an excellent courier service, now I avoid them like the plague. I recently ordered a new android phone from Rogers and to my dismay they used Purolator. I was waiting in the lobby of my building and I saw their truck pull up. The driver made a call on his phone and left. A DAY LATER, I was email one of their ""sorry we missed you"" excuse slips. EMAILED! I had to arrange a ride to our local Purolator outlet to PICK UP my package because I certainly didn't want them to charge me for a delivery they won't complete. Now last week I ordered a dog cage from Amazon.ca and was horrified to see that Amazon shipped it by Purolator. Guess what? Package is late due to ""missed delivery"" at their depot. Now they can't find a package that is at least 4 feet wide!!! Lousey company, used to be great. Now they deserve every single crap review they receive. Totally useless and SUPER LAZY IDIOTIC drivers! No wonder Amazon.ca prefers their OWN courier service. Their returns are done through Canada Post or UPS. I'M NOT SURPRISED!!!"

I truthfully believe that you have to FAIL any aptitude test in order to get a job with Purolator. There is no possible way a company and it’s workers could be this pathetic without it being purposeful. The level of incompetence is baffling.

"In case you didn't face this situation YET, I like to warn you about the new charges from Purolator.
I was surprised on latest Invoices with new charges .They are charging overweight charges for any boxes over 50LB.
They said this is a new charge as of Oct. 2020 . Example the shipments I have been sending to the same client, the same address , the same boxes , the same weight I was charged aprox $68 for the last 5 years.
Now, without a notice, they charge me $164.10. If I knew about the new charges I would have opened the boxes and sent inner boxes for less weight but more number of boxes!!!

AGAIN, They also started a new charge called the Peak Special charge.

They sent me a new charge on a 2nd Invoice for the SAME SHIPMENT , a Peak Special charge for $16.95 .

After talking to customer service to remove the charges since I didn't know before, they said they are not authorized to do that.

This is what we call: TOTAL RIPOFF."
"Ordered a product from Banff I live in Canmore I don't have the time and money to drive to Banff. They stopped by and left a note that I can pick up my package in Calgary!?

Canmore is 20km one way, Calgary is 116km one way. I will have to drive 232km to get a package that was sent from 20km away. Now I have to spend almost 4 hours and about $60 in gas to pick up my parcel. Not happy at all.

This is the worst service I have experienced. Had thousands of dollars of Arc'teryx delivered to my door and left by another company no problem.

So called the support center they said they could redirect to another address. I did that and one of two separate packages arrived. The other was still in Calgary so I waited and then called and was told my package was being redirected and give it a few days. After a few days I called back because it was saying they would send my package back to sender they said no it will be redirected just take a few days I should see the status on the truck in the next few days. I check today, 10 days after they tried to deliver it and they said they are returning it back to sender. Seriously I did everything checked up and it still gets returned."

The package was delivered to the wrong address. When I called to ask for follow up with the agent who told me he was going to take care of it I was told there was no notes that I had called and they don’t make notes for every inquiry.

"If I could rate them a 0 I would. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. My package has been in Vancouver for 3 weeks & apparently they are ‘trying to deliver it’.
I live in a building where there is 24/7 concierge- I’ve never had an issue getting a package delivered from any other company.
One of the customer representatives on the phone had the audacity to say “you should be grateful you can afford this, we’re in a pandemic and most people are in poverty.”
So incredibly unprofessional & distasteful. I am an essential worker & after saving up for while I ordered a bed frame. My bed is currently on the ground & my back IS KILLING ME. For somebody to tell me to be grateful for something I worked hard for is beyond rude. After ordering a replacement, it was supposed to be delivered today but AGAIN IT WASNT SUCCESSFULLY DELIEVERED & I STAYED HOME FROM WORK TO RECIEVE THIS PACKAGE.
I will NEVER recommend purolator- they are the worst company I’ve ever came across."
"Hi Nikita, thanks for the review. Our sincere apologies for this situation. I'll contact the depot directly to make sure you receive your bed frame as soon as possible. I've reviewed the call and the agent and yourself had this candid discussions about how tough COVID was on a lot of people to which you replied how lucky we were here and that it was a first world problem to have delays in the delivery. The conversation even ended in a warm and friendly way. I'd be happy to review this with you if you have any questions. Please feel free to email me directly.

"Is already a Month it never arrives, so be careful with this people. After talking more than 5 times with them, it never arrives even tho they promised they will sent it and they mark it as delivered so be careful about that, luckily I could cancel and asked my money back.
This happen even before Covid.
I was the whole day at home after a huge delay times, over 5 days they say they attemped to delivery and I was here the whole day in my home, the costumer service is worst of any other place, I give 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. From all the delivery companies Purolator is the worst. Better cancel your package until they set other delivery company.



Just an update: you can se the replay they made to me , they said, they will deliver “tomorrow” never happen at all. Usless if I have the choice to never picked them to delivery to me I will, even if I have to pay bit more for this option."
"Hello Emmanuel, thank you for taking the time to write this review. As per our conversation yesterday, you informed us that your buzzer is not working which makes it impossible for us to reach you.

"I usually do not give bad reviews. But this time, I have to voice myself so that others can avoid using the service as possible as they could!!!

The worse experience I have ever had!!! I see many others were saying they wanted to give 0 if possible and now I understand why.

Waited for days and eventually got the notice “on vehicle for delivery” early in the morning, waited till 2pm and called customer service told no idea where the deliver guy is and no way to know when this can be delivered, no matter how important this is. Kept waiting waiting, kept watching through the window for their vehicle, walked back to bedroom for 10 mins due to a call and got the status “receiver unavailable”. The door bell never rang and no one never called!!! Called the customer service again and told they never call and maybe the door bell is broken!!!

I really do hope they go out of business soon!!!

Thanks,"

"Would give less than 0 if it was an option.
No updates on my guaranteed within 3 business days for over a week. Hold times are ridiculous when attempting to reach customer service, and my package that was guaranteed is now a paperweight in Toronto!
Next time I will have my shipments delivered by carrier pigeon."

"If 0 was possible I would, waited all morning for my package. 1208pm driver pulls up infront of house I'm standing in driveway he shuts truck off rummaged in back for no more than 15 seconds then started truck and just drove off. Not even an attempt to deliver. Been on hold with customer service now for 28 min and counting. When I finally get them on the phone they claim ""it's on a different truck"" customer service is non existent and their delivery delays are ridiculous.

Update: Finally received package at 530 pm. After making a call to the shipper of this package and having them contact Purolator to ask what was going on. I will be asking everyone I deal with not to use Purolator when shipping items to me from now on."

"Worst shipping company ever. I live in an apartment building. Their delivery man never leaves delivery notice. And there is no phone call to notify you or re-deliver attempts neither. If u r busy for a week or buy something small that you didn’t tracking constantly it will sit in their storage for a whole wk and u will hear nothing about it. And their virtual assistant is completely useless.

I’m here to warn you, if u can avoid their service plz do. And all business, if you see this I urge you not to use their service. I will also make formal complaints to the brands I bought from to not use their service. Terrible experience every single time."

"Horrible. Purolator has had my package in Vancouver for over two weeks now and not only are the unable to deliver, the are now unable to locate my package. They said they attempted delivery but never contacted me when they had my phone number. I received a FedEx package from the other side of the country in two days. The worse part is the customer service people keep giving me excuses. I will never use them again."

"I have ordered two bedframes from amazon to be shipped by Purolator that was supposed to arrive on 11/02. The delay was supposed to be two days maxed. They proceeded to lose my package when they ""switched drivers"". I proceeded to order a second package hoping that it was a fluke. I ordered on 11/03 and the package was supposed to arrive on the 11/06. It never arrived and and again, my package was lost when they ""switched drivers"". At this point, I was extremely pissed and called Amazon who had graciously forwarded me to the Purolator support line. The support staff that answered my call would not provide me their name. She then proceeded to say that they could not locate either of my packages, the estimated arrival dates or even whether the tracker was accurate. When I explained that I didn't really care if it was delayed anymore, as long as I had a solidified pick up date, she hung up on me. I reached out to Purolator on Facebook to see if it was possible to get a better idea of where my 1st bedframe was and they would give me a vague answer of ""it'll arrive delayed due to poor weather conditions"". The 2nd bedframe provided me an even vaguer answer of ""it'll arrive delayed as a result of high volume""."

"We have shipped thousands of parcels with Purolator, and had no problems. My only complaint with Purolator is that they do not round dimensions properly.

The rule for rounding weights and dimensions are always round up to the next pound and round down for less than half an inch, and round up for half and inch and greater.

Unlike Canada Post, FedEx, Loomis, CanPar etc, Purolator alway rounds up diminsions. If you are sending out a borderline oversize parcel, that can double your shipping cost, once you receive your invoice."
"Never had issue with Purolator before now. Package was expected yesterday then I get an alert saying it's rescheduled for the next business day. So then today, I wait and watch my cameras... Nothing all day, then another alert for the reschedule again. I wish they would give more of a reason and a better estimate."

"Everytime Purolator is assigned to deliver me something, I have to go fetch it myself as they can't get to me for whatever reason (I live in a pretty big city) and that I can't contact technical support as they never respond calls and their internet support don't help me in any way, just refers me to calls"
"Delivery driver was brought into our building by a stranger I assume, since they said our package got delivered and he made his way in somehow. So, he decided to leave our package inside WITHOUT giving us notice of his arrival. This was on November 11th, 2020. More than 30 minutes later I realized the package was delivered but nowhere to be found. I've opened a ticket with their support and they want to put the blame on the shipper, ignoring the fact of that delivery driver. Very displeased. If you guys continue this way, I hope businesses will stop using you guys. Change up your ways. For each time a Delivery Driver of yours drop by without announcing his arrival, I will lower a star. For great service, I will increase. Hope that sounds fair. This is regarding Delivery #CGK006796828 & Case #CS-13257163. Support agent is Delphine Daigle.

UPDATE, November 12, 2020:
Delivery driver buzzed my door and I was able to retrieve the package. Thanks! This is regarding Delivery #332576860008"
"Said they attempted delivery which is a lie, I was tracking the package in real time all day and it never even came close to my street. I was home all day sitting in the living room beside my door. Then the website said they left a card with instructions - of course they didn’t because they never attempted delivery.

Tried to call customer service - on hold for an hour then disconnected. Called back, on hold for 2 hours before I gave up.

Go to their website and try to use “virtual assistant” which is a garbage AI that is so poorly programmed it can’t help with anything. It tells me it will connect me to a live chat agent - I wait for 30 mins and nothing.

Absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever had, I still have no idea where my $3000 package is and they lied about attempting to deliver it. Why would anyone willingly use this god awful company?"

"Admittedly I missed 1 single attempted delivery to my home and received a note ""Please pick up your parcel at XYZ location. We will hold the parcel for 5 days"". So I go to the location on Day 2, and the person behind the counter said it never made there it and was instead shipped back to the sender.

Huh?

Why was it shipped back to sender when I was told to pick it up at this location? The poor kid behind the counter didn't know, so I called Customer Service... they tell me, ""yup - it was shipped back to sender"" but couldn't give me any more information other than the exact same information I could get from the website using the tracking number.

What is the point of support if they can't help beyond the tracking number information?

This parcel was a warranty replacement for my heater. It's winter here and now I've got to wait for 1 week for the package to get shipped back and then HOPEFULLY the manufacturer (Dyson) will reship my package because as far as they are concerned ""Delivery was not accepted"" which is all the tracking number says, not to mention is untrue!

Now Purolator wants me to contact Dyson, because they're ""unable to do anything now"".

IMO - Purolator should contact Dyson and tell them it was their mistake. This mix up is between you and Dyson, not me. Clean up your mess!"

"My sons medical supplies have been delayed due to a “Missed connection”.
You’d think if you had medical supplies from a well known medical supply company on your truck you’d make sure you didn’t “miss the connection”
This medical company offers a delivery company choice of Purolator, Canada Post or FedEx... I will be using FedEx from now on.

Edit: Funny how I am told in a response to this something COMPLETELY different then what the very unfriendly customer service rep told me on the phone this morning; according to her, I was lying about my delivery being listed as “Missed connection” as my order label was only created today and to be shipped today. Last night I spoke with a rep over Facebook messenger which went just as poorly.
This company needs to get on the same page ASAP. As someone who works in customer service, you get a lot further with a customer if you show some empathy and compassion instead of complete annoyance.
Today I changed my courier company with the medical supply company to use FedEx. From now on I will use FedEx or CanadaPost, if neither is possible then I will shop elsewhere for whoever does not ship with Purolator."

And then they had the 'wrong address' on file.
And then on Nov 5, the deliver was schedule for the next business day.

"I would give zero stars if I could. It is the absolute worst courier I have ever seen.
From last 5 days, I am expecting my parcel from these thieves and they have same update everyday which says that 'Address correction required - incomplete / incorrect address provided' Oh boy, be mature and stop all this S***service. You're wasting someone's time and money."
"I finally received my 2nd parcel with my medication. The first one was returned to shipper since it was not delivered to my civic address but to a Purolator drop off point! Which is Dave Vacuum which is a third party!
I have alway gotten my parcel delivered to my civic address for the last three years. By a third part and a Purolator contractor TDR/MBW courier!
I was told by the Purolator that they do not ship ASR designation by TDR/MBW courier and instead the rerouted my parcel to their drop off point in Bridgewater that 40 klm from my home! So I have two question for Purolator!
1. What is the difference if TDR/MBW courier get the signature or Dave Vacuum , Purolator drop point?

2. Why are area outside your truck route are being deprived of civic delivery when ASR designated parcel are being shipped?

I feel your service is discriminatory toward rural area by this policy and requires attention and rectification so that all community are given the same and equal service?

I look forward to Purolator reply to these questions!

Thanks

Every single time I have a delivery through Purolator, I get a notice on Amazon that delivery was attempted but unsuccessful even though I was at home all day long. Then I go downstairs to look for a notice and there is nothing. Every single time, without a hitch, I canceled my orders that are being delivered through Purolator because of this.

"I got the first part of my package. The second part gave me so much issues. The second part would not give me a tracking update for an entire week. When it did decide to give me an update and tell me that it was finally going to be delivered, it failed to do so because my ""street number was not found."" When I went to go talk to the phone support line, the lady on the other end pretty much blamed me for not having the correct address. Which is complete BS because if the first part of my package came in perfectly fine, why would there be problems now? It's frustrating to wait pretty much the entire afternoon and then hearing this crap and now having to wait more to come pick it up the next day (which I've decided because I wanted to receive my package ASAP). Although, I don't even know if that'll go through without any issues because I now have to contact them another time to ""resolve an issue.""

TLDR; So many problems for one package delivery which shouldn't have any problems to begin with."

"Absolutely disgusted with the lack of service from purolator. Purolator continues to sell “one day Guaranteed” mailing labels, however they won’t actually stand by that guarantee. Paid for a live item to be shipped by one day, but have not received the item and it will now die in their facility over the weekend. As of May they no longer guarantee their GUARANTEED DELIVERY SERVICES YET CONTINUE TO SELL THEM!! I am devsastated, angry, furious and at a loss for words right now.

"Is there a minus star for this piece of $h!t company?
Waiting all day long for delivery, just to find out that now I have to go for my 1lb package all the way to their distribution center. Supposedly I wasn't home. IT IS COVID pandemic, I work from home, you piece of crap!!! Of course I was home. The problem is that you didn't even try to deliver it. On top of that I have an electronic door bell set up next to me. You just needed to press it, you f...ing a$$hole. But you were too lazy to do it, because you actually never showed up. I hope you go bust in no time!!!"

"This service does not deserve a single star. Was expecting three parcels, one yesterday (now expected tomorrow), one today (now planned for tomorrow but likely to change) and one just got shipped and was expected between Nov. 5 (today) and Nov. 10 for which I need to notify the sender if I don't receive it by Nov. 12.

"My parcel was to be delivered yesterday. After 5pm got an email it was rescheduled for today. 5PM today no parcel. I called the contact center. They said due to higher demand cause of covid it was rescheduled to tomorrow. Tomorrow will be day 3. I told the Rep. That I have gotten parcels via FedEx with no delays at all. He apologized. I told him if I had the choice I would go with FedEx myself. I asked if they stop delivering at 5pm and he said in more rural areas it is 5 and the cities it is 9pm.

"Package was supposed to be delivered by 9:00p.m. today, however they delivered early by about 4 hours which is great.... however I am not at home I am at work. I get a text from my neighbor telling me that there is a parcel in the middle of my driveway. I thought that was strange...considering you have to climb the steps to a semi enclosed porch to get to my front door and ring the bell. So am curious as to why the parcel was not left on the porch but in the middle of the driveway. This tells me that he didn't even bother to ring the bell he just dumped the parcel in the middle of the road. My neighbor was kind enough to put the parcel on the porch since I am still at work I have no idea if I received everything. I checked tracking online and it said that the package was signed by OSNC ...have no clue as to who that is...so does Purolator pick a random person off the street to sign for a package. I would be apprehensive of having Purolator deliver any of my parcels....especially if no one is home to receive."

"The worst service ever. They picked up my package on Oct 13, could not deliver because I did not provide the entrance code, and this is where the nightmare starts. I have filled up the forms that they provided, made three phone calls and just requested them to send my package back to the center that they picked up. Did it ever happen? No. I called them again on 22nd they apologized and said we'll return it in two days; again, they did not. Another phone call on 28th with the same request, they promised that they are alerting their team and will RETURN the package in the next two days. AGAIN, nothing has changed. I made my last phone call today, said and heard the same story one more time. I'm not going to call never again because each time I spend 1 hour talking with someone and hearing the b.llshit. I have tried to be patient, but enough is enough. I told them they should either return or keep the package; I will never call again. Thanks for wasting my time and not caring about your customers."

"I AM LIVID, the worst delivery service I have ever received. I ordered a massage chair for my friend from a company who used Purolator as their courier. I was emailed that the parcel was getting ready to be shipped and NOT that it had been delivered. By the time I was curious if it had actually shipped, it had been three days since it was delivered. The tracking notes say that it was delivered to the mail room. The mail room at that address is an open space with zero security, open to anyone who walks through the lobby. The building office was not open at the time and the fact that there are no signatures in the delivery document support the fact that the courier just left the box in the middle of a high traffic area without notifying anyone. The recipients apartment number was listed as was his mobile number. As he is disabled, the recipient finds it difficult to leave his apartment and is home mostly every day. Had the courier knocked on his door or called him, the recipient would've been able to receive the parcel. I have spent a lot of money for this item, a massager for my friend with crippling nerve pain, and I believe the appropriate measures were not used in order for my item to reach the recipient.

Furthermore, I called customer service who opened an investigation. After several attempts to receive an update, they forwarded me an email they received two weeks ago stating that the investigation was closed because the parcel had been delivered at the right address. That was never in question. I wanted to know why I or the recipient was never informed about the delivery.

Absolute ridiculous. Waste of time and money.

"Horrible!
Sells a service (Purolator Express®) which fails constantly, and does not warn the shipper---removal of guarantee notice is only provided when trying to track parcel---however there is no refund of cost of service paid for, let alone reduction of...
taking money for a quoted and detailed service which is NOT intended is theft !
Shame on you!

Edit: Purolator """"client care"""" (aka: Catherine---see reply posted below) decided to reply requesting I contact them directly to look for a resolution to my """"issue"""".. only to be told t o u g h l u c k (""... perishable items as they are sent at the shipper’s risk ... contact the shipper to see what their procedures are for this type of situation as there wouldn’t be any compensation, due to the nature of the content ..."").

"Purolator picked up my item (a front bumper for a Jeep) On Friday October 23 2020. Their website advertises how they can handle oversize items no problem. Scheduled delivery date was Monday October 26 2020.

I stay home all day of course. Nothing. At all.

A few days later I have to contact customer support who says they will initiate a Trace. I'm like - why? It's sitting 15km from my house with Purolator.

I get an email from a Trace guy saying they are having delays with large items. They will give me updates IF they get any before it's delivered. That's it.

So - what am I supposed to do? Just keep checking every day? Will they even deliver it - ever? I obviously need to be home when it's delivered. And since I seem to be the only person who initiates contact - it's just hard to believe it feels like my item is being held hostage.

It's been 10 days now since they picked up my item so I emailed back asking for more information on what Purolator expects me to do while they sit on my product. I have received nothing back yet..."

"Worst carrier ever! I have a package addressed to my friend. He knew the package is out for delivery because I got a notice and texted him. Around 11 am, he decided to go for a quick walk, on his door he already found a note that says... We missed you and indicates the date address to pick it up. He was at home all along, no knock on the door and already got a note. I called Purolator for a re-delivery. I told them my complain that delivery guy didn’t knock so please notify delivery man to knock the door. Next date of delivery, my friend at home, no knocking but they saw in their surveilance camera a guy walking without anything in his hands then left. My friend went to open the door, guy is gone and my friend found a note again on the door from Purolator. Time on the note says 12.00 when it was only 11 am and again no knocking the door. Delivery guy has no intention to deliver the package thats why he just went to stick the note on the door. Never again will I buy online without asking what company is their shipment. Purolator? Worst shipping carrier even after calling their Customer Service!"
"Hi, Frank here again, from June 26th, 2020 with a fourth incident of Purolator's incompetence.

I ordered another parcel from Amazon (rest assured, my prime subscription has been terminated since then). They claimed they attempted delivery but couldn't make it to the front door on this Saturday evening at 5PM. Strange... there was ample room for courier trucks to park in my building's driveway... Every other courier does it! *shrugs*

Every time I am informed that Purolator has my package, my blood pressure rises again. I think to myself ""will I lose valuable time instead of working will I have to babysit the phone for the intercom to make sure they deliver this time"" or ""what excuses will Purolator come up with now?"". I think it's neither. I honestly believe that the same courier I complained about saw my name on the parcel and bounced, making sure I didn't get the package. I won't file a complaint with Purolator since all their previous promises of fixing the problem seem to rear their ugly head sooner or later. This time, they lasted about 3 months since June/July... almost 4 months actually! Great work guys!

And if I see a response from their customer care team asking me to communicate with them to have the issue rectified, I'll tell them this ahead of time: GO SIT ON A CACTUS, VANESSA/JAMES/DOOFUS!!!"

"First time using Purolator because the site I ordered my items from has this company as it's only option for delivery.

I entered my address properly to be told that it's ""invalid"" had to contact customer service just put the same information, and after that only half an hour after the failed delivery the correction, it's been delayed to not show up till Monday. I haven't even seen a Purolator truck on block the whole time. Which looks like the driver did not put any effort to show up at the address.

Agent told that the apartment number and the buzzer is ""missing"" making it sound like that I made the mistake. When it was there the whole time.

When the information gets updated the tracking system doesn't update till it's delivery time again. in user experience perspective this looks like the whole case hasn't been solved at all.

Get your systems fixed and give your drivers a raise so maybe next time they will give a damn about our packages.

And FYI this is my first time writing a review in my life, I have never been this disappointed paying for a service and not meeting client expectations."

"I can't agree more with people on this thread. To be taking time out of my day to write a bad review about this company says enough. Their infrastructure is awful. There is disconnect everywhere. Their tracing specialists can't even get ppl to respond to them. They ignore delivery preferences, like why even have them if the drivers don't look at it? Their site is trash, their customer service is trash, and I can honestly say I will never use them again. If you are considering Purolator for your delivery service, think twice. Your package will sit in the delivery truck all day then they will tell you they attempted delivery and drive your package to the other side of the city when you paid for expedited shipping. They do not call or message you when they arrive. They won't spend more than 2 minutes at your place to give you a chance to get out of the bathroom or shower. Purolator is trash, don't use them."

"What a load of crap! I upgraded my phone through Rogers and the delivery was placed with of course These guys, it said on the stupid tracking app that it was out for delivery at 8:01 am I have been at my house from 7:30 till 6:30 at night when they notified that they “attempted delivery” but no one to sign for it. They never even came by and even better they never even left a slip for where I can pick it up. I called in rampage saying that I have cameras on my property to know if they even came by which they did not. Even better the lady on the phone said she will have it delivered to the store which is close to my house so I can just pick it up, today it again says it’s out for delivery and when I called the pickup location they told me that it will be delivered to my address. So much for communication. I insisted that she should find the location of the truck so I can be aware of a estimate time of delivery but she goes on to tell me that no one knows their location. What a bunch of crap So sick and tired of this company. Never having anything shipped from them again."

Purolator is one of the worst delivery services available. Was supposed to have a delivery today and they sent me email saying incorrect address and no buzz code to get into my building. Clearly on my order the address is correct and there is a buzz code in delivery instructions. Called purolator woman was rude and said that sometimes they don’t receive all the delivery instructions. Why put delivery instructions if not given...then got email this morning at 8:23 am saying package attempted to be delivered look for note to be picked up. Never received a call stating they were here... these people are very lazy and just do not want to deliver to the door in an apartment. Whoever the manager is needs to make sure their workers do their job properly they are being paid by customers to deliver products to the customers home

"I wish I could give zero. I do not understand why they call themselves a delivery service when it is their protocol to put packages into the truck and then just drive them too a pickup Center. This company has no purpose and makes it harder to have an item delivered than to go out and buy it. Amazon Please stop using Purolator, they don’t care and they are a detriment to your service!!"

"Absolutely horrible customer service. I waited all day for a package and the driver did not attempt delivery, as I was excitedly waiting for my package and tracking it all day . COVID 19 has been such a stressor on everyone and these little moments of joy were additionally killed by Purolator, who had the power to be a catalyst for simple moments of joy - such as receiving a long awaited gift.

Purolator also claimed they delivered it to my front door after their ""investigation"", which was a complete lie because my house cameras did not detect any motion at the time stated. Customer service continues to put a ridiculous amount of onus on customers (who really just want our package and not all of this additional stress) and none on your irresponsible drivers. GPS confirming location does not mean the package was delivered to the correct house, just the correct area so please stop using this ridiculous ""finding"" in your sloppy investigations. Hold your drivers accountable, they are not doing their jobs with integrity or due diligence. I wish I could give this horrible company and its incompetent drivers less than a 1 because this is not the first time this has occurred to me and friends/family."

"Fastest shipping I've ever experienced in the middle of a pandemic and living literally in the middle of nowhere in the Algonquin Highlands. They delivered a special item to me just 36 hours after me ordering it, this has been weeks faster than any other shipper.

I am highly impressed, I recognize that a lot of negative reviews may come from the fact that people want to express their experience to warn others, however consider that there are cases where Purolator does an outstanding job and I'm still in shock that this item came THIS quickly and in perfect condition.

Thank you and know that I will write a solid review if it's warranted, which for the service it absolutely was this time."

"Dell sent us a rushed laptop for our new hire so that we could get it on time. They unfortunately used Purolator.

Today I checked the tracking number wondering why the laptop did not arrive. The tracking history shows that Purolator has been driving around my city for a week and a half with the laptop in their truck.

They have allegedly made two ""delivery attempts"" however we are open 9-5 and our receptionist was not aware of any attempts.

I called customer service to see what is going on and after 2+ hours waiting for an employee I gave up and hung up as I had other things to do.

Not only is this terrible customer service but it is an absolute disregard for the environment - ""Let's have our trucks drive around town carrying packages that we won't actually deliver.""

I have no idea how this company has managed to stay in business but they should be boycotted immediately.

EDIT - Updated to mention that Purolator's generic copy paste response of ""send us your tracking number"" to its thousands of 1 star reviews is a perfect sample of how careless the organization is. Instead of assigning someone to respond to these, I recommend fixing your severely broken operations or better yet begin the wind up of your goat rodeo delivery company."
"Wish I could give them zero stars! I was trying to track down a shipment they made an error on labelling and they admitted the error and tried to correct it but would not give me any details on when I can expect a delivery nor did they apologize for the error. This shipment has affected my business and now is costing us close to $1000 to correct because they can't do their damn jobs! Also their customer service when they do not want to speak with you anymore just decides to hang up! Glad Fedex and UPS are beating them, their a pathetic company!"

"So if I have a package sent directly to my residence, you can't put it in the mail room, but can leave it in front of a house?

Had a package to be sent to my apartment and it was taken back for ""missing key code"" (we use key tags) and customer service told me that you absolutely needed a signature for the package pickup unless told by shipper. So I had it redirected to my parents house, and it was just left and rang.

The experience was quite a mess. No idea if anything they told me was true or not. It could've been left in our mailbox with no issue.

Was really quick though, but now will have to wait more for a family member to bring me my item, which is quite unfortunate, seeing that I could've gotten it days earlier."
"Had no issues, the lady and gentleman at the Purolator office were very helpful and kind and my 71lb package made it from B.C. to Ontario in less than a week!"
"Phew now I can add my review to all the other lovely reviews I have read for this sh*thole of a company. I order off SHEIN a total of 3 times so far. My first 2 orders were so successful because they were delivered by Canada post, an exceptional company and they deliver to my community mailbox. My 3rd order not so successful and you can guess why, if you can't then ill give you the answer...Purolator. I've been tracking and it says it was on the delivery truck in Mississauga and then another update of ""attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"" yet it was posted in Mississauga when the delivery address was in Brampton. OF COURSE the receiver was not available, YOU guys aren't even in the right city you dumbnuts. My parents are both retired so they are home all day so even if they were in the right City, my father says there was no knock/ring and there was no notice either. Now my package says its scanned as a pick up and will be held for 5 days. I have it delivered to my father's address because he visits me every 2 weeks and drops off mail and other things because I do not drive. I am also in a different City than him. Now they are telling me to pick it up in Mississauga which is even farther away from me. DELIVERY MEANS TO MY DAMN EFFING DOOR OR MAIL BOX. I'm giving it 2 stars because I did contact customer service and was ""helped"" by Richard Y who said he had asked them to redeliver it. He then gave me a reference number and I asked what am I supposed to do with this? He said nothing, it just proves we helped you. A reference number isn't going to have my package delivered faster, if it even gets redelivered at all. I am waiting on the changes to the tracking and if no changes I am for sure coming back with my ONE STAR update."

"Amazon needs to stop using Purolator now. I have de-prioritized them with Amazon,
unfortunately some shipments are still sent by Purolator. I was at home, my buzzer code was clearly on the order and no one called my phone. I have never has ONE package delivered to my apartment by Purolator. Just so-called ""attempts"" and then making me pick up my stuff 30 km away at a depot. I ordered a dresser and stayed home because I wanted to be here for the delivery. They had the gall to offer Saturday, I am not sitting around like a chump waiting for a driver who won't get out of the van. I'll be more careful next time, as soon as I see an order is Purolator I will cancel the order immediately."

"Purolator is horrible not because of any overt maliciousness or scheming but because the infrastructure they've set up for their service is so, so, so horrible. I've signed up for tracking notifications for my shipment over 5 times and still did not receive an email that my shipment was ""refused"". When I check my tracking number, the details on their website don't explain where the delivery was attempted for pickup, or where it is being held - asking their ""virtual assistant"" doesn't give you any information beyond that either. When I call their customer service, it's obvious that the information they have access to is not any better or different than the information I can get by going on their website. The times when it does give me information, it's not even accurate - I went to a pickup location after receiving a notification that it was delivered, and after seeing on the site that it was ready for pickup, and it just wasn't there. Why is it so difficult to have a little amendment saying ""your package was attempted to be delivered to here, and it was refused for this reason""? If it were up to me, nobody would ever use Purolator for delivering anything, but unfortunately I, and other shoppers, have to deal with the unfortunate nonsense of a company that only has one foot in making any effort to modernize its processes."

"Ordered a monitor from Dell didn't know it was going to be Purolator, ships from within the same city yet they won't carry the actual box up to my door or ring my doorbell, instead just sticks up a crumpled note into my door and expect me to drive to pick it up a day later. Why even hire the delivery drivers at this point, you could just send a message to your customers if you expect everyone to pick up their packages from the warehouse."

"Amazon needs to stop using Purolator or change their agreement. Apparently if after the first attempt for ground shipment is not received, they do not want to guarantee or take responsibility of the delivery. They will not compensate for their confusion, timing issues or their staff's lack of care or attention.

I had paid extra to get a television to be shipped for a Grand Opening. Made arrangements to have staff and rented a truck to deliver the television from head office to a site location. The first delivery attempt was day earlier than expected but it was not delivered properly because the driver or person trying to deliver did not want to listen to additional instructions to find the correct entrance. Called driver to come back but they left the area and she said she going to attempt a second time the next day. They did not come as expected.

As it was late, we had to call Purolator to re-direct the package to a new location. The driver came back on 3rd day to the original location even though it was requested to be re-directed. We advised that it was re-directed but the same driver claimed again that they could not find the entrance of the first location and left again even though they acknowledged the side street and hung up abruptly. We tried to outside to find the Purolator rep and truck but both were not visible.

One Purolator regional manager tried to ensure the package was redirected to the new location and expedite the shipment but the instructions were ignored. The delivery was delivered after 6:30 pm on the day that it was expected as if there was no faster shipping request.

Called back and asked Amazon to do a conference call to request compensation for not just the Amazon fast tracking fee but also extra staffing hours and truck rental charges. Purolator advised they do not take any responsibilities nor compensate because it was not the first delivery attempt."

"Received an amazon update that purolator was not able to deliver because they don't have buzzer code. I provided this in my delivery instruction. Went down the apartment lobby to look for a note, did not see any. By the way, the buzzer codes are printed above the call box. Prior to this, tracking shows they are unable to deliver because the mattress is heavy. They made it appear that they don't have a buzzer code as an excuse. Called their customer service 3 times and gave the code and my phone number. Latest update shows that they cannot deliver and they will contact me for appointment. They never called! They don't have the intention to deliver because the item is heavy! Why pickup something you can't deliver!

Contacted amazon to deliver a new item using a new carrier! And to purolator customer service, don't bother telling me to email you my tracking number. I already wasted enough of my time dealing with you guys!"
"Amazon needs to cancel the contract they have with this company. Worse experience every single time. It's 2020, how the hell does drivers not have phone to call customer? Items for my daughter's birthday today and I can't get them in time because of purolator. They have lazy drivers customer Service is useless. Telling to come and pick it up, I shop online because I don't want to go to the store, that's why I pay for delivery. Whenever Amazon uses purolator I know its bound to be a fail"

"Submitting yet another 1-star review. I have yet to receive a single delivery on-time whenever an item ships using PuroLATER, and I order a lot of stuff online. I've had Amazon deprioritize them as a courier, but every now and again I get the odd package sent with them and dread knowing that they'll fail to deliver even after seeing the ""On vehicle for delivery"" scan.

UPDATE: Customer service never ended up getting back to me. Their replies are just them trying to save face. Garbage company."

"I would say that I'm extremely disappointed with the service or lack thereof with regard to tracking, the non delivery and inaccessibility of my package but that wouldn't be entirely true. This is just a typical Purolator experience. Just like in the first installment, Poor Customer Service, Miscommunication and their sibling No Communication reprise their starring roles.

When I ordered it last week, the delivery date said Monday. That was then changed to Tuesday, then Wednesday once Tuesday came. Since then, no updates. I was supposed to be reached out to by one of the tracing specialists, no response. This was meant to be a gift.
I can only hope it arrives before the person's next birthday at this point.

I asked whether I can pick it up, met with a no. When I asked why, this vague non answer about my package not being eligible for pick up was fed to me. However if it's not being delivered, the least you could do is tell me where it is, why it's delayed and how soon I can expect it. I've paid my own money for what's in the box and I'd like to know what you have done with my money. If you can't fulfill the delivery, say so, so that I can pick it up and deliver it to my house myself. If my package is lost, which clearly it is since it's not been scanned for most of the week, then just say so.

This has been an all round poor experience but we knew that it would be going in and my complaints unfortunately are ALL too familiar. This whole operation is a scam and I genuinely wish them no future success. Maybe once they fold, online stores will be forced to use better services. I also know this is a pipe dream.

Useless customer service, useless tracking, a tracing specialist who doesn't know how to send an email and drivers who lie about attempted deliveries. If I was this inept, disaffected, unskilled, unconcerned and completely out of touch with the needs of my clients in my job, people would die. Some of us don't get excuses at work. No matter how hard it is, we have to get it done. All we're asking these employees to do is ring a doorbell, send an email and update a tracker online. Have some pride in your work and make an effort. Stealing a living cannot be fulfilling. Never using this service ever again. This will be my 2nd and last experience with them as long as I can help it."
"2 god damn beyblade launchers that way the same or less than a pencil. In a town less than 15 minutes way. This day 3 and I still dont have the package.

"Ordered a mattress off Amazon, they left it in the lobby of my building without even telling me or changing the status to delivered. I will never again knowingly use this company.
Edit:
I'm not wasting my time reaching out to you. Your company is useless. The frame was 90lbs, you thought that was an undeliverable weight, what would you say your company does?

The people they hire don't care their drivers definitely do t care and there customer service is a joke....this is last time I use them I will actively cancel future packages if they coming through puralator and will tell all my 100 plus people I know never to use them....AVOID COMPLETELY

"If i could, i would give 0 star.
Tracking is wonky, text notifications too. But also, my package arrived at almost 8pm (despite living in the same city (~10km) of the Purolator where my package was at), the delivery person did not ring (despite my package containing pricy electronics and the weather being terrible), the package was not even closed to the door, and the package was so crushed that i could reach in wihtout opening it. Thankfully, there was no tiny items (as i intended at first to buy an SD card too) that would have fell off with how big the gap was because of it being crushed.
It's not the first time i have a below average experience with purolator, compared to other services like Amazon, UPS, Canada Post, but this one was particularly awful.
The only plus side is that it arrived quickly but I'm sure it is mostly thanks to the company I ordered from."

Absolutely the worst I've ever come across. When you think they couldn't get any worse get what. They actually can. I was at home in my living room on the main floor they said they attempted delivery but no one was home but the driveway is full of cars and there's a doorbell but the dufus left without even ringing it. They left a note saying package will be available at the depot next day. Call the depot next day package isn't there because they're attempting another delivery. Same two cars in the driveway with the door bell there to be rang but they didn't and decided to leave a note saying pickup item at depot the next day. Smh.

"I would give 0 stars if I could. This is nonsense!! I ordered a TV to Moncton NB. The TV arrived at the Moncton sorting centre and then for reasons the employee on the phone could not answer, the TV was sent to Dartmouth Nova Scotia! When I pressed the employee all I got was “sorry I can’t explain why it got sent there” they did not care one bit! This company and there employees are a joke they do not care about getting you your package on time at all. I understand a delay because of covid, I do NOT understand a delay because my package was sent from the city it was supposed to be in to another city. Ridiculous. If anyone is stuck with Purolator as your carrier for amazon good luck! Call Amazon after they mess up your order and have them de-prioritize purolator as your carrier!"

My packages love to travel to multiple different provinces bypassing where I live completely until reaching mine and then sitting in the sorting facility for 3 days. And then an ‘attempted’ delivery of a package that looks like it’s gone through a meat grinder.

"If I could, I would give them zero stars... It's almost unbelievable how terrible this company is! I've had quite a few ""encounters"" with them and every single one was bad. Unlike for example UPS, they don't tell you WHEN they will be coming and they never re-attempt deliveries. Once you missed them, that's it! I live in Vancouver while their office, where you are supposed to pick up your stuff, is in Richmond. There's no bus access and I don't drive... So on 3 separate occasions now I ended up NOT collecting my parcel at all, especially that they only keep it for you for 5 days. What is more, even if you do have the SNR sticker on your door, they at times insist that a signature is still required and they won't leave it at your door if you aren't at home - what's the point of those SNR stickers then??? Seriously, if I knew that something I'm buying online is going to be sent with Purolator, I'd rather buy it somewhere else..."

"I would rather slap my grandmother than deal with Purolator, and I love my grandmother.

I ordered a large, expensive, and heavy item. If you've read other reviews, you may guess where this is going - and you don't need more than one guess. My Amazon address has my ring number in it, because I'm not a monster and I like to get my stuff. The following courier companies have had no issue delivering things to me: UPS, FeDex, Intelcomm, Joeyco (some new crowd-sourced thing out of Toronto). They use the ringer, I let them in, they leave my stuff at the door, everyone is pleased.

Not Purolator. So this large, heavy, expensive item is supposed to be here last week, so of course it only shows up this week - but whatever. COVID / Corona, blah blah - I get it. So you can imagine much to my disappointment where Purolator, now 2 for 2 (they've done this exact thing 2 times out of the 2 times Amazon sent stuff to me using them) shows up, doesn't even bother ringing the buzzer, slaps the ""sorry, we tried to deliver"" notice on on the lobby door and books it. The notice helpfully tells me that I can go get the item myself, tomorrow, at their depot.

Do I get paid for doing a part of the job? Will I get reimbursed for the van I'd have to rent to get it here? Can I rent a dolly? If I wanted the joy of lugging a large oversized thing myself in a tiny sedan (which it can't fit into anyways), I'd have gone to a big box store to get it and not wait a week plus for it to show up.

So, I call up their customer service to complain and ask them to try to actually deliver it. They tell me that they will try to re-deliver, tomorrow, maybe, if there's room on the truck / room in the schedule. Wow.

When I ask why they couldn't even bother ringing my buzzer, they tried to feed me such a load of crap that they must have thought I was a compost bin. Apparently, my ringer number isn't on the shipping label (I say BS, since NO OTHER COURIER has had this issue) - but fine. I ask if it was too much trouble to look at the directory RIGHT BESIDE where they slapped the delivery attempted notice. I was told that they didn't have the time. To look at one sheet of paper, for the buzzer number. It literally takes 3 second to look at this alphabetized list, which is a lot less time than trying to deliver it again - but they don't have the time.

Also, this is a total load of crap - they had no intention of trying to deliver - I know because the notice that I got about the attempted delivery says they tried to deliver at exactly 10:30 AM, even though the website for their tracking says the delivery attempt took place at 11:49 AM. So they clearly pre-wrote the ""sorry we missed you notice"" before they even showed up, because they had no intention of even trying to deliver (why else would it be pre-written with a fake time?). Can't check the directory, has no time, but has time to pre-write these labels.

In the future, I will avoid doing business with any e-merchant that uses Purolator, because I like to get the stuff I order, and don't like being fed a bunch of indifferent BS by customer service agents whose only interest is defending the incompetents of their delivery staff.

If you must use Purolator I recommend getting a lawn chair and downloading some good games, since you'll need to sit in front of your building the whole day to intercept these so called couriers if you want any chance of receiving your stuff.

EDIT: 21/10/2020

So, I spoke to a third customer service rep who confirmed that the representative I spoke to yesterday gave me violently incorrect information.

Apparently, no delivery was made, because they were supposed to call to confirm a delivery time due to the item's size, which the rep admitted they never did. The rep who promised re-delivery today was also lying, since that is not the process for a parcel of this size. And the notice telling me to go get it myself was also incorrect. Needless to say, I still don't have the item, and I am waiting on a call from Purolator - they have another hour and 14 minutes to do so before I cancel the whole order and go with someone who will use UPS to ship it.

So, 1 representative out of three actually provided useful information - and my thanks to that rep, at least I understand what happened. Still extremely unimpressed with EVERYONE other than that one CSR, who seems to be the only person over there who actually cared about doing their job. I'm sorry she has to work for such a garbage company - a more competent courier would be lucky to have her.

Needless to say, package is still late, still no call, and the situation hasn't really changed. My rating stands, though I am impressed they actually read this review and bothered to respond after I emailed them as Catherine directed. I wasn't expected that - too bad it didn't seem to advance the delivery any."

"I absolutely detest Purolater. I've never had a good experience with them! I live in an apartment complex and my unit's buzzer number is the same as the unit number. My address through Amazon has the buzz number, and I presume when the shipping label is created, it would have the same information. Their usual couriers (Intelcomm) have enough courtesy and decency to actually read the address and deliver it to my door. But Purolater, that's another story!

I waited ALL day for a large, expensive, heavy (90lbs) item. While I was waiting at home, I received an email notification stating that ""the receiver was unavailable."" The driver didn't even buzz the apartment, absolutely nothing! I don't even trust that they will even deliver the item undamaged (I've seen the videos of how they treat packages and lose them).

For the past 7 years, they've been nothing short of awful. I absolutely DO NOT have the strength to carry a 90lbs item by myself, nor even a vehicle with the space requirements! This is the reason why I ordered it to my door. Seriously, I'm so frustrated!!!!"

"I would no stars if I could. My experience with Purolator as a shipping company has been beyond frustrating. Have had four different packages delivered to my address and four different experiences. First one was great. I wasn't home and they left the pickup slip for the location that is conveniently located in my neighborhood. Way it should work!!!! Second package was carded for a different location in Brampton but taken to a location in Mississauga way out of my way, considering I don't drive and with all the craziness of covid very inconvenient to try and get to. Called and arranged for redelivery for the following Friday since I would be home to receive. They screwed up and sent it out on the Thursday. Luckily my daughter was off that day and home. Lots of issues as these were cell phones that they were giving me a hard time about delivering as the package was in my husband's name and I have id showing same last name and address. Had a third package taken yet again to a completely different drop off in Mississauga despite there being a drop off only 10 minutes from my home in Brampton. What is with this inconvenient process and inconsistencies???? Today was the final straw. Ordered a hybrid bed in a box mattress from Amazon. Purolator delivered it to the wrong house!!!!! Don't your drivers even verify an address??? I was at work when I got the notification that it was delivered and called my neighbor to check my doorstep. Kinda hard to miss a box containing a queen sized memory foam mattress. But it wasn't there!!! My neighbor found it on the doorstep of a house in the adjoining townhouse complex and was able to retrieve it for me much to my gratitude. Purolator needs to be more careful with leaving items and double checking addresses."

Sending dangerous goods ( Lysol spray) looked it up on your website says no problem try filling out paper work as a guest as I do not have account. Web site would not except anything just kept popping up go to your purolator shipping center. Did this told them exactly what was being sent they filled out shipping paper took my money. 7 days later returned incorrect paper work. Talked to customer service manager & apparently this is all my fault says I didn’t read to bottom of website. Well let me say after reading multiple pages & there all saying same thing go to agencies.Even tried the help line same go to agencies. All said & done I’m out money. Will never use this service again GARBAGE Don’t bother replying not interested in your sorry BS. Iean small

"There was no update on my delivery in progress for 4 days, so I tried Chat, it was automated and said it would connect me with a real person, Never Did...So I called on the phone, I did not wait long, BUT the agent was unable to tell me where my package was. At first he told me it was probably in my city and to check back tomorrow, but when I pressed him why it was not scanned leaving Toronto or arriving in Québec, he said they dont always scanned departures and arrivals of packages. REALLY?! Then how do you know where they are. Regrettable, I believe this IS the case, and they dont know where our packages are most of the time. Surprised they are still in business, I will complain to the company I ordered from about the bad delivery service."

Got a text saying my package was delivered at my front door. Opened the door and nothing was there. Went online to The virtual chat To ask where my package was and they completely ignored me. Come to find out it was delivered to someone else. Thankfully this person was an honest person and called me to say they had it because if not I would be out hundreds of dollars. Horrible company!

"laughable

worst shipping service. their call help line has an hour wait time. they ""attempt delivery"" but didn't actually then they make you pick it up at some distribution centre on the opposite end of town rather than reattempt delivery

Edit: I had already asked the person over the phone if they could reattempt and she said no, so I took a cab to get it instead. Alternatively, when intelcom actually attempted a delivery which I had missed, I called in and they sent the driver back."

I just had a Purolator ring my Apt and not answer me when I answered saying hello I went down to find a pickup slip telling after 4pm I can pick it up 5 blocks away this was at 10am and I'm very upset and MAD that Purolator would force me to go out and face multiple people in stead of just the one Purolator, if I could find anyplace I can rate Purolator I will get 3 out of 5, this is not the first time Purolator has done this"

"Absolute worst delivery company period! I have NEVER HAD a package delivered on time. Today's excuse was I needed to add a unit number and that my address was wrong. That's funny because I LIVE IN A TOWNHOUSE. There is no unit number. Completely useless drivers. I once confronted a driver leaving a delivery slip at my last building right over the sign that says deliveries to concierge out back. Do you think he cared? No! He told me to my face that the concierge wasn't there. The 24/7 concierge wasn't there. Their drivers are lazy, and useless and will do literally anything to avoid doing their actual job. I am so sick and tired of dealing with them. Even their phone agents are miserable. This is what you get with a government funded business. They all know they don't need to work and will still get paid regardless."

"I ordered a package off of Amazon that was meant to be arriving on the 14th but came to find out that the delivery would be delayed a few days, i made this order on the premise i would get it before the weekend and on Friday the 16th i found out i wouldn't be getting my package till the next business day (Monday the 19th) and honestly, i was pretty upset with the result being so because the package ordered was something i needed for the weekend (ordered 2 pillows + pillow cases as i had family coming over and needed to accommodate them), so here i was about to add on another 1 star review to the list of many other negative reviews when to my surprise, the package arrived on a saturday (their website stated Monday so this was a nice surprise) so while the experience was up and downs i will say they did in my case deliver the item when i needed it, albeit a few days later then the given delivery date by amazon."
"As other state, driver says 'attempted delivery but no attempt was made'. Checking at 5PM, the tracking page says out for delivery by 8PM. At 6PM, the tracking says delivery attempted at 5:33PM. Nobody attempted any delivery as I was home since 4PM! And no notice even for where I could pickup was left, nothing to even indicate the driver showed up..! When I called Puro to ask about it, I'll have to pickup, but it won't be available til Tuesday (today is Friday). Way to provide a quality service Purolator, you lazy SOBs"

"If I could give a -5 star rating I would gladly do it! 2 DAYS staying home waiting for a package and they never delivered it but only left the typical ""We're sorry we missed you"" note. And the LIAR of a courier identified with ""ROUTE 34A"" backdated the tag to the day before they left it on the door! Despicable! I know this to be a fact because I called the local office to see if the item really was available for pick up and as expected, the item was not even in their system yet! WE WERE HOME FROM WORK FOR 2 DAYS WAITING FOR THE PACKAGE YOU BUNCH OF LIARS!!!"

"Worst shipping experience ever. I was waiting a 500$ package that was already 2 days late. So I went to their tracking website, to learn that there is an issue with my address. (Which was entered correctly). So I tried to correct the address, using even Google Map to ensure the format of the address was ""ok"" and it didn't work. So I had to speak with them to get this right and she told me to expect another 1-2 delayed days for my shipping, just to learn that my package was already at their reception point,15mn from home. So I told her to cancel the shipping, that I would go picked up myself. She told me my package would be ready for pickup the next day. So the next day I went to their reception point.... to learn that my package was on their truck for home delivery. This is the wors shipping company I've ever do business with. Never again."

"I have a bed frame coming, it's a single package 68 lbs. Apparently it arrived at sort facility in Richmond BC on Friday Oct 9th, and tracking showed expected delivery Tue Oct 13th. Then early afternoon on Tuesday it changed to say package heavyweight, customer will be contacted to arrange delivery. I called Purolator, and after 1.5 hrs !!! on hold I finally talked to an agent who informed me that the package was never on a truck, and that it will require a truck with 2 drivers because that's standard for packages over 70 lbs (package is in fact under 70 lbs but whatever), and they will call me. I asked when I might expect the delivery, would it be Wednesday or later? She couldn't say, she didn't know when they'll be delivering to my area, but when they do they'll call me to give me a 3-hour window during which I should be expecting it. Seriously?! Wednesday morning tracking showed ""Appointment required for delivery, receiver will be contacted to reschedule."" No one called but an hour later tracking showed ""Unable to deliver - delivery date rescheduled"". So now it's Thursday 8:30pm, tracking info says 'expected delivery Thu Oct 15th' but no one called me all day and I think it's a safe bet that the delivery won't happen today. So my package has been sitting in Richmond, 15km from my home, for a week, for no good reason and without any attempt from their end to make arrangements. In contrast, I ordered something from the Netherlands on Monday and UPS delivered it today. That's a distance of 7,700km delivered in 3 days; while Purolator can't manage 15km in a week. If I had a truck, I'd go pick it up myself, but it won't fit in my car unfortunately. I had no choice in how the package would be shipped, but you can rest assured that in the future I will avoid Purolator at all costs.
UPDATE: After writing this review I contacted Purolator again the following morning because the status changed to 'estimated delivery date not available'. Didn't call this time, I didn't have 1.5 hours to waste again; and the 'chat' on their website never loaded, wheel kept spinning. I tried FB and actually got a fairly quick response, and following that I was contacted by a customer service person via email. He was trying to help, promised to open an investigation, but couldn't tell me where my package was or when it might be delivered. And guess what? I got home from work that afternoon and found the package had meanwhile been left with the concierge in my building (those were my original instructions). So obviously I was very happy that my bed finally got delivered, but how is it possible that the representative I was emailing with that same day was unable to find out that my package was on a truck to be delivered literally as we were speaking?! And why was I told I'd be contacted to arrange a delivery when that wasn't the case?! What a mess. It really doesn't inspire any confidence in this company."

"It is unfortunate that I don't get to choose courier options while ordering online, if I could, I'd say anyone BUT Purolator. Not one good experience with them, and not one bad experience with anybody else. Their typical ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable"" is beyond pathetic. No calls from the buzz at the door, no calls on my personal number, wonder how the receiver's unavailability is determined. On top of this nonsense, they apparently ""Attempt Delivery"" only ONCE. Then the package sits at a facility where you would have to show up with your ID to pick up. In my case, it is 15 Kilometers away. I've lost count of how many times I've had to deal with this."

"In 16 years I have never had a single good experience with Purolator. In the off-chance they actually load my parcel on a truck, I have to pull up a chair and from 6pm to 9pm and wait in the parking otherwise they'll stop, glance at my house and speed away, updating that ""The business is closed"". Yes. My house is closed.

Lately though? Tracking says on truck for delivery at noon, then updates at 9pm with ""Delayed due to pandemic"".
Guys, if you're not gonna deliver, say you're not gonna deliver. Don't waste hours of my life having to wait to accept a package in my driveway that's not even coming."

"I ordered a PSU from amazon, the delivery was suppose to be two days. I made sure I waited home all day for it to arrive. When it was approaching the evening I wouldn't leave the tracking page, id constantly re check if it finally arrived or well for any update. The next thing I know, it says delivered I rush downstairs look everywhere but there's nothing.. It even says it was SIGNED by me.. This is the worst fuc*king company. Their delivery drivers are so fu**cking lazy, the cu*nt just called it a night scanned my parcel as delivered and just fuc*ked off. I don't understand why does this company still exist, they don't give a flying s*hit about our parcels



Update: I got my PSU, the fu*cking driver gave it to my neighbour that lives like 4 houses away. It baffles me how he got the address wrong. Another thing that really still pisses me off though is that it still said SIGNED by me.. even though I literally never even saw it until my neighbour gave it to me a few days later. My previous opinions still stands, this company is a mess. I don't understand how they still operate."

"I can’t even give a one star review. Purolator is a f***ing joke. Last week the fiancée got a phone delivered to the house, and then had them add a line for myself. Long story short the driver dropped off the fiancée phone in the porch like the sign note that was left on the door had mentioned.(we both work Monday-Friday) I’m about 40 mins from the house, and when it came to my delivery of the phone, I was lucky and had a few hours between training so I came home and the driver was in the driveway as I pulled up to the front lawn and as soon as I stepped out of the truck he sped off like he was in a massive hurry. So I called purolator since the driver was still in town and the lady had a straight up nasty attitude that said well that’s not our problem that’s your problem. It’s been a week and we’re still f***ing fighting to get my package. Word of advice, if your package has to be shipped from Purolator dont f***ing buy it! They are an absolute f***ing joke."

Garbage. Seriously.. This year alone I had at least 10 issues with them in terms of receiving my packages. Their system is slow and outdated. Tracking takes forever to update and sometimes doesn't even update. Drivers don't knock on your door. Some don't leave notice so I don't even know where my package is. When they do leave notice and I go to pick up my package it's not there because they say information is missing from my address. If I get a notice to pick up my package anyway why the heck do you need to update my address. Just ridiculous. Wasted so much of my time and gas. I even requested some of my e-commerce sites to stop sending my packages using purolator. But for some where I have no choice. I still get the same problems over and over again. I'm sick and tired of having to contact them all the time to resolve these issues. This company is trash. I don't know why businesses still use their service.

"Toronto, Weston.

I had a Purolator pick up scheduled today to send out my documents for immigration. He missed me the first time and the second time I made sure a call was placed because there was no door bell rang or knock on the door. Eventually he called, I got out and handed him my documents. He said ""where's the Purolator envelope?"" and I mentioned that I was told that Purolator would provide the envelope as I had already paid for it. Then he said ""ok whatever"" and got an envelope out. I put the documents in and he asked me to get a glue stick to paste the shipping label on. What?? Anyways I agreed and told him I'll go in and fetch it. He said no thanks and just took the parcel and left. I'd like to add the guy was high AF! He reeked of weed and was very very evident. I just hope my documents go through because these are very confidential documents and have money in it too!! I've never been so tensed and angry about a delivery company ever!"

"First off, they do not give a flying crap about you, you are a body. They’ll throw “I am trying to get you a job in your face like you incompetent of finding one else where. I communicated with Chelsea from the Nashville and Murfreesboro location. I interviewed with Purolator International. I am a bachelor degree holder and former student athlete and was trying to find a 2nd job.(handsome resume for a warehouse job). The only thing I asked for was professionalism and to start by the end of the week to provide a paycheck the next Friday. Interview went great, Chelsea AND Purolator said I could start the next day. Generally, when you find a job, you cancel the other interviews for the day/week so I did. 30 to 45 minutes later, I get a call from Chelsea saying I can’t. Yet I cancelled multiple other interviews that would have been eligible to start this week. They made a mistake, but did not want to deal with the stress they caused somebody else in the subject of money and providing for family during a pandemic. Now I will have to wait 2 weeks for a paycheck because of their irresponsible and careless mistake on somebody else’s life. Literally the only thing I asked for was professionalism. Chelsea, talked down to me as if I were a kid, an immature tone the entire time dealing with HER MISTAKE, and to top it all off, they cancelled the position due to my frustration of unprofessionalism. Not only did I interview with Purolator and listen to the recruiter absolutely degrade the current employee (only other job was Wendy’s) to me. Absolutely unprofessional. The entire interview was about how lazy and “doesn’t give a crap” With that being said, I didn’t get the job due to the unprofessionalism with Volt staffing. The phone call ended with Chelsea saying “let me coach you up a little bit kid.” Lol I don’t have to express my accolades to point out no staffing agency should ever talk to their candidates that way. To top it all off, they had another agent call me apologizing, saying it would be fixed (was not lol), and acting like they cared was only contacted after that so I wouldn’t leave a review like I said I would. I said I’d leave a review so this dog crap doesn’t happen to anybody else and their moods completely changed. I recommend NOT going to either of these companies unless you want to be degraded, dehumanized, and be in an overall toxic work that did nothing but talk about another employee for the hour I was there."
"What a joke, literally the worst post in Canada. I understand everything is being slowed down due to Covid, but it's been almost a month and my package is nowhere to be found. I paid almost $500 for shoes from Vans for myself and my husband, paid extra for shipping but I did not even receive a tracking number from them so I had to contact Vans to get it. I chat with an agent from Purolator today and it took me 20 minutes to explain to this guy that I just want to have the status and the exact current location of my package, he instead placed a request to return my package back to Vans. Like how the f*** can you read that and did something completely different. Then I have to call them and waited on the line for 45mins just to hear another agent said that my package had been sent to the wrong depot and its been sent back and forth between this people and the original sender this whole time, how can you do that when the delivery address clearly said ""NORTH YORK"", now my package is still at god knows where, probably already being stolen or damaged. I'm still waiting for them to contact to tell me where my stuff at, so surprised that they're still in business, get your own employee to do their job right. So disappointed.

Updated: I finally got my package after almost a month of waiting and rushing them. My package arrived in a whole total messed up box, there was a giant hole that you can actually see what’s inside. The box itself was badly damaged but luckily all my shoes were okay. Still, will not recommend anyone to use Purolator unless you wanna get constant stress and heart attack."

"I gave them a star because I have to rate them; honestly, they deserve none. It baffles me how this company is still in business. I have literally NEVER received a delivery from them ALL because I live in a building that does not have a buzzer code. I understand they do not call their customers about deliveries, but they also do not email you or reliably leave delivery notifications on your door. They expect you to phone them and follow up before transferring it to a location for pick up. If you fail to deliver a package, kindly hold it somewhere that your clients can pick it up and inform your client of where it is LIKE EVERY OTHER DELIVERY SERVICE. My heart sinks every time I order from Amazon and see Purolator is the delivery partner. Also, good luck dealing with their customer service, in my experience, their team is quite rude."
"I literally let the Purolator delivery driver into the building; then got a notification that 'delivery attempted - receiver unavailable'. Huh?!?!?!?!? So now i assume there is a slip at the front door of my building telling me i now have to pick it up......not what i paid for!!!! This has happened time and time again with this company! I pay for DELIVERY!!! Not to take time out of my day to now stand in line and pick it up. Ugh, so mad and fed up.

UPDATE: I just received my boots to my DOOR. Thanks to James that helped me out, and redirected my delivery. Thanks so much! Updating to 4 stars for the customer service."

On the 3rd time of calling purolator told me the package was oversized and could take up to 14days(The item was only coming from the other side of the city) Contacted amazon they had to cancel purolator from delivering it and get a new company to deliver it. Not sure how delivery company like purolator still do business, if I could give them no stars I would!"

"There is major road work in front of my building which is an ""Amazon"" building. Every day there are parcels in our lobby that several different carriers were able to deliver. (I even have my groceries delivered no problem). One carrier sends a pic to confirm delivery and there were three other packs next to mine in our lobby on one day.

However, the purolator delivery guy never even tried to deliver the pack; I'd get Amazon notification that my pack was delivered but in fact it was returned to purolators distribution center.

Called customer service three times and was told another delivery attempt would be made but every time same answer; sorry we missed you... pack ready for pick up.

It's too bad Amazon customers can't chose the carrier for their delivery as I would indicate ""any carrier except purolator""."

I paid extra for the speedy 2-3 day delivery since I needed something for work and got it off Amazon while Amazon's drivers have always been amazing and nice to me but this time they shipped with Purolator and I waited all day they just drove by my place said attempted delivery and then did the same damn thing for the next two days I ended up having to pick it up across town next to the Amazon warehouse where it start it. I honestly can't believe some dude doing a small gig at amazon cares and does a better job then these people that do it for a living..I called Amazon and had to fight to depriorize Purolator so they don't use them anymore ...

This is the company you cant trust drivers all lazy. I keep on tracking my package since morning until the estimated time of delivery after some minutes status has change saying cant find enter code which literally just beside our front door. When I called them they said if there is no enter code in your package the driver will not deliver it and you need to pick up your package. So instead of using that suggestion i said next time when I order online i will put note not to use puralator as the shipper since theyre always giving me trouble. First they left my package in my door and got stolen. (They said its not their fault and driver has the right to do that since it doesnt need signature) second I missed my package even if Im home and third this happend again!

"They missed me even Though I was home and would have heard a knock or doorbell. Now I have to wait 4 whole days for "" The authorized shipping agent"" to receive the package or something so I can pick it up from this random store. Maybe I'm too used to the FedEx or other shipping companies that would just be sent to my local post office where I could sign it off and is a 2-minute drive from my house. The worst part is, they won't even deliver it after the 4 days wait, I have to drive 15 minutes there and 15 minutes back. Just very inconvenient and I don't understand why this is so complicated."

They came all the way to my home and sat in the parking lot with my parcel and said they could not deliver it as they did not have my unit number. They did not even bother to contact me, the driver or the company. I had to contact them. When i saw there was a issue with the adress. Then they said we have no idea really when your item will arrive. What kind of company is this?"

Package has been sitting in Vancouver for almost 24 hours now and has been Scanned 8 times at the same depot but they can't get it shipped out??

"Using this courier service was a major mistake. My mother has sent a package to my address and the delivery man made absolutely no effort at actually delivering the package to me (On multiple attempts). I had to call and get them to redeliver my package the next day, only to have him show up without knocking or ringing the door bell, slap a delivery attempt notice on my door and leave. Do I have to sit on my front lawn in a lawn chair to catch this courier, or what? How can this company call themselves a delivery service. It appears that the ""quality"" of this service is a reoccurring theme within other reviews and is not just a fluke."
"This is by far the worst shipping experience I have ever had. Lets just say that they lost my package and are doing nothing about it. They are blaming the company that I purchased the product from, for losing it, even though their delivery guy choose not to read the address that is on the box. Also lets just say that the address it was delivered to is not even in the same city, it was supposed to go about 60km from where is was delivered. Also costumer service is a joke. They do not reply to email and no one ever picks up the phone."
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I ordered something important and its suppose to come today. But I got an email saying they delivered my package, but got left with a notice saying they got no response, but I never heard a knock on the front door, no door bell ring, nothing. Now I have to wait tomorrow and go all the way to their blood depot and pick it up. What the hell is wrong with Purolator. Their customer service is a joke, the rep on the phone says that the drives can't call or text to let the customer know they are on their way or if they arrived at the home. So it is not known when the package will be delivered because you could wast a bloody day waiting by the front door for Purolator. Dam even Dominos Pizza calls the customer for when they arrive, why not the Purolator drivers? Since when don't people have a smartphone. Excuses, excuses.
After I get my package from Purolator,
I will never use Purolator again, never."

First package was because according to them it didn't have my buzz number, which funny enough, it was right there under my appartment number (I always order from Amazon and one of the things I make sure is there is my buzz number). Now they say they will not enter my residential building and they attempt to call me when I am working. Are you for real? By the time I saw my missing call they had been waiting for 8 minutes...

"They are pathetic in terms of customer service. First of all, they say express shipping and they don't work on weekends. Second of all, they don't ship the items if there is slight rain in the area. They just update shipment cannot be delivered due to bad weather conditions in their tracking site, without providing proper information to the customer or a text message stating the same.

There is no estimated delivery date on the tracking page as well, post that update.

I would not even give 1 star for their service."

Thank you for this review. We're sorry to hear that we disappointed you. Can you please email us the tracking number? We'll look into it for you. If weekend deliveries are available in your area, the sender can select this service when they ship your order. Poor weather conditions can occur at the ship from location or while the shipment is in transit, which in turn delay its arrival to the destination terminal.

Had a parcel shipped to my parents. My tracking said an attempt was made to deliver...but no attempt was made. No notice left of the door of my mother's house where she was home all day. They dropped it at the local post office. The point of delivery was so my parents did not have to go pick this item up. So it not only was past the expected date of delivery...they didn't even try to take it to their home.... other delivery services have been able to manage to deliver stuff to their home.... My husband tried to call and was on hold until he hung up. I will never choose to ship with this company.

"Purolator is the absolute worst. I ordered a package on Amazon on Sept 22. I was told that my package would arrive on Sept 24. I waited around all day on the 24th, which was yesterday, and nothing. Due to COVID-19, I expected it might take a few days longer, which is fine. But I went to bed early last night (at 8:30pm) because I had to be up early this morning. Then when I woke up this morning, I checked my Amazon account and see that Purolator tried to deliver my package—at almost 9pm last night. Who the heck delivers a package at 9pm? And why no phone call beforehand? I live in an apartment building so I went downstairs to see if they left one of those sticky pieces of paper with information on when they would deliver my package next. In the past, with other shipping companies, they would leave a slip of paper that said they would try again in 2 business days, or something like that. They did leave something. But it said that my package will be ready for pickup on Sept 28th at a location that will take me over half an hour to bus to. This is beyond frustrating. First off, I PAID for shipping so I expect the item to be shipped. I ordered a yoga mat. If I wanted to pick up, I could have gone to a local store and bought a yoga mat. Secondly, how about delivering my package before 7pm? That would have been reasonable. I live in Vancouver. After tracking my package, it says it arrived in Richmond on Sep 24 at around 2:30am. But it wasn't sent out for delivery until 11:30am. I understand it takes time to sort through all the packages, but come on. And then it took until almost 9pm (9½ hours) to be delivered? It takes about 30 to 40 min to drive from the furthest point in Richmond to where I live, and probably a bit longer in rush hour traffic. And probably longer if you are delivering packages along the way. But 10½ hours? And lastly, why not just wait until the following day to deliver it? When I could have received my package at a reasonable time?"
"Hello Sarah,

"Drivers frequently fail to receive, read or follow special instructions, such as alternative entrance to property (as main entrance is closed for repairs), entry code &c.

All of this information is on my Amazon account, and either not passed through (on a reliable basis) to Purolator, or they somehow fail to act on it, or, and I hate to suggest this, some drivers are less than conscientious or truthful.

The drivers do not have the ability to call me (as the receiver), and I know this could be done in a privacy-friendly way as certain other carriers do it.

Lastly, Purolator apparently does not have the ability to add special instructions to an order that has yet to be loaded on a truck for delivery. The call centre rep (who was actually very good) advised that I would have to phone back, once I saw via Amazon, that the order was on a truck for delivery. I would have to ask at that time that the special instructions be relayed to the driver in question, i.e. the special instructions that have been on my Amazon shipping address for several months, and that no other carrier has a problem receiving, reading and following.

And one more thing, I patiently waited until 8 am to use their online chat service, and there were NO agents online between 8:00 am and 8:05 am. I was not put into queue at all, which suggests that no agent had logged into the queue.

None of this is acceptable in Canada, in 2020 (pandemic or otherwise), and for a company of the size (and at least historically, the stature) of Purolator What has happened to them over the past several years?

Not certain if the special instructions issue is on the Purolator or Amazon side, or in between, but that is up to them to work out, and frankly not my problem.

I can now say with conviction that the best carrier in Canada is Canada Post (XpressPost). Good for Canada Post, and shame on Purolator. This makes me wonder whether Purolator has a major problem in its management culture, in terms of accountability (or lack thereof) for operational excellence.

Virtually every review is one star, so my experience is evidently not unique. I will be writing to senior management at Purolator (and perhaps at Amazon Canada) to indicate my displeasure.

This level of incompetence is costly to both companies, both financially and in terms of their respective reputations, and costly to me in terms of my time."

"Failed to deliver a parcel when all instructions where provided, then when I first called up Customer Service they hung up on me, and subsequent calls where aggressive, and they consistently pushed a narrative where I was in the wrong.

For the first time in my life I had to contact Amazon and blacklist a delivery provider from my account. If you are an individual and you've had a similairly negative experience as I believe there rating here shows. I recommend you reach out to Amazon's customer service team and do the same."

"I am not sure of the level of education and intelligence of the average Purolator delivery person, but I assume it quite low on the scale. I have phoned, begged, screamed and threatened about where I wanted my packages left. Each time I am assured it will be fixed, but each time it gets worse or stays the same. What part of ""I WANT MY PARCELS ON THE FRONT PORCH RATHER THAN ON THE BACK STEPS, WHERE THEY ARE UNPROTECTED FROM THE ELEMENTS AND I RARELY GO OUT THAT WAY SO THEY GET MISSED"" don't they understand. This is the 6th phone call about this and am constantly reassured that it will be fixed. WRONG.. Drivers are doing whatever the hell they want to do regardless of the directions that I leave for them. I am done with this. I am no longer going to order Tupperware because Purolator doesn't follow what I want. On the front steps, I have a ""no signature required"" scanning bar but they are too lazy to walk up a few steps to do it right. Easier to drop on my back walkway or back steps."

"I've been waiting for Purolator to deliver my glasses from clearly.ca since Monday, and what a mess it has been. The driver stopped by on Monday, but left without leaving a notice because there was no entry code to my apartment building. Fine, I used the Virtual Assistant to -specify- that my building has no entry code, and that I would prefer if they could bring it to the nearest retail location for holding. Tuesday passes and still no delivery. This morning I see that the package is out for delivery, only to find out 30 minutes ago that the driver did NOT deliver the package AGAIN citing a lack of entry code. I've waited a total of 78 minutes so far on the customer service phone line today, all the while -still- needing my new glasses to go to work. I know the pandemic is affecting us all, but this is getting ridiculous. Please Purolator, see this and help an essential worker out!"

"As Ontario enters the second wave of Covid 19 afflictions, I was enjoying a coffee at about 11:30am on Sept. 23 at a safely-spaced table at the Tim Hortons on Dunham Dr in Alliston Ont.

In waltzed a Purolator driver -- UNMASKED and seemingly defiant about it -- to stand at the counter where food is prepared in order to make a delivery.

Leaving the cafe, I passed a Fedex truck driving on Hwy 89. The driver was masked.

As Fedex proved, it's not impossible for a busy delivery driver to mask against Covid. The company just has to care enough to make a driver wear one. Purolator obviously does not."

"Honestly, if possible you should avoid their services. I have been waiting for 1.5 weeks for a one-day Amazon Prime delivery. They keep on claiming the building is closed, even though I noted by now 4 times (!) how to access the building (through an open staircase right next to the main entrance, so not too difficult).
They asked me now to contact a Trace Specialist to tell them how the package looks like from the outside (how would I know? I never received it) and what it contains (none of their business in my opinion).
I understand that there are delays due to COVID-19, but not being able to forward delivery instructions has nothing to do with this. Very annoyed by the experience."

I amm too sick too type all that has happened with my medical filyers and ehat Purolator has done to my life and health.Terrible company and no one cares.
"It seems like I fell victim of this company's horrible practices as many others did. Order on schedule for delivery on the expected date, received update stating that I was not at home and delivery note was provided... Buzzer never rang, concierge reported not one person had showed up during the day for any sort of delivery and the mailbox had absolutely no delivery note. The driver made more of an effort to lie about attempted delivery than actually trying to deliver it.
Contacted the company and offered to provide my number so the driver could call if he has any difficulty, barred by ""we do not make call upon delivery""...
The year is 2020 and there are still companies living in 1980.
I've escalated the issue with Amazon and I was delighted to hear they set me up to never have them deliver anything to me again, unless there are no other options available.
This company is the worst, do not make business with them if you can use anything else."

The first time I had them send it back because I didn't want to deal with an incompetent company.
The second time I order textbooks for university and instead of delivering them, they take it to their post office for me to pick it up and notify me 5 days later... They literally drove it further from my house than the actual bookstore. Instead of a 20-minute bus ride now it's over an hour... How did this company survive in a capitalist society?

If i could give you 0 stars i would says my package was delivered... no package here no one rang the door bell or knocked on the door even though we were home all day. So i thought maybe they delivered it to the gas station where they receive purolator packages. Nope nothing they looked in there scanner nothing came in but the truck that dropped it off supposedly well they scanned it as delivered. What the dipshit do throw it on the street as they drove by like wow first time getting a package through this service and just horrible what a joke. I thought canada post was bad you guys are the bread winner here crappy service you dont even deserve 1 star more like a negative more like it.

"I have placed many complaints with Amazon about Purolator and I will continue to do so. One time, when they actually delivered my parcel on time, they didn't even bother ringing me at the intercom to enter the building. They just left it on the street, outside, by the entrance of the building. Who. Does. That? Purolator drivers, that's who. I have now lost count of the number of times my packages are delayed because the ""address information if incorrect or incomplete"". Which is quite bizarre, mind you, because the packages eventually get delivered a week or so later, without any change to the address whatsoever. Makes you wonder if they hire incompetents on purpose or because the drivers are deliberately doing this because the company is bad. Either way you slice this cookie, it's bad, very bad."

"I order online stuff all the time and Purolator interestingly is the only company that NEVER ""finds"" me home.
Today I was expecting a very important object that I needed for a job tomorrow. I stayed home the whole day waiting for it. Suddenly I get an email saying the courier ""couldn`t get ahold of me"" and that my package could only be picked up in 3 days.
As soon as I got the email I ran outside trying to find their truck. Drove all over the neighborhood looking for the Purolator truck while trying to contact costumer service. After 40 minutes waiting on the phone someone picked up and I explained my urgency. Long story short, the attendant didn`t know where the driver was, didn`t know where he would deliver my package, simply said they couldn`t do anything about it... Horrible! Just horrible service every single time. We should all write to Amazon as well to stop using this company!"

"As a frequent online shopper I have received numerous shipments from all the major delivery services and PureLater is by FAR the worst. After several bad experiences I now simply avoid the purchase of any goods that are shipped by PureLater. They are the ONLY shipper that makes no effort to deliver a package if you dont answer the door, doesn't call, doesn't take note of online shipping change requests, wont leave at the door even if a sign requesting to do so is posted, etc. The most frustrating part is if you dont happen to be at the door when they arrive, it can take days before the package is available at a local depot for you to pick it up, particularly if you miss a delivery on a friday (in my case, the closest depot is 30 min drive away, other major delivery services have numerous). In one case following a late delivery for something I needed for an out of town trip, 2 days after expected delivery based upon 'tracking' (what a joke that is), I called and arranged to pick it up at the main receiving depot the following day on my way out of town. You guessed it - NOT THERE - ""sorry sir it is on a truck to your address"".
Save yourself the grief of finding a PureLater sticker on your door indicating you can pick up your package in 2 business days at a far away depot and use another company! Let's hope they fade away into oblivion..."

Ordered a tv. Delivery guy came, never buzzed, left a notice. Didnt do his job thats a start. My roommate had to call, wait 2hrs on the phone, he was told we'll have it the next day. The next day he had to call again because still nothing after 2hrs again of waiting he got told THEY FORGOT OUR PACKAGE ( the package was in a warehouse not to far) This is a real joke. Next day.. again nothing.. ( now it say our package is an 1hour away in anothrr warehouse ) this is getting absurd. Then best thing ever we receive a notice saying our package will be delayed of 2 or 3 open days...

"Ordered cookies from a company not too far away on Wednesday (16th Sep '20) Purolator tried to deliver on Thursday (17th). We live in an apartment building, all you need to do is find our names on the intercom, it calls us and we can buzz them in (for security of course, we don't want anyone off the street to be able to walk in to our apartment complex). However the delivery drivers for this company are so incompetent, inept and ignorant, its frankly astonishing how they can even survive day to day life, seeing as the thought to use the intercom, which any person with a degree of common sense would do, is absolutely foreign to them. ANYWAY, because of this incompetence, the delivery was failed because we were never able to let them in. My girlfriend was contacted today about how to get in the building, and the lady on the phone almost sounded offended that the delivery driver couldn't just walk into a secure building. Now we won't get our delivery until Monday. Bear in mind, the package is a food item which will probably have spoiled by the time its delivered on Monday, and thats if the delivery drivers have been taught to use their brain over the next two days. If our package is spoiled, its on Purolator. Period. And we will then be seeking compensation."

"Worst experiences ever. For the last year, we have been asking that our parcel be delivered to our deliverable address in a rural area of Alberta, and half of the time, we get it. Other times, we have our parcel delivered to various depots around us, all about an hour away from us. Due to serious health issues, we are unable to pick them up. I have been on hold with customer service an hour each time and have talked to them at least 6 times, twice in the last two weeks.

"Updated version*****By far the worst delivery company!!!!
-Driver left without buzzing on first attempt (package was heavy and road obstructed)
-Scheduled second delivery on a fixed date( took a day off). They never showed up.
-Scheduled another delivery the following day (took a day off). Never showed up.
-Waited 1h30 minutes on the phone 3x.
- Now trying to hire another company to pick up the package since they are unable to achieve a simple shipment. But pick up is impossible since they can't locate the package.
Still waiting for my package after taking two days off. I wish Amazon would stop using this miserable company. Amazon service is always good but when it comes to big packages it is always hell with Purolator.
I have never been so unsatisfied with a delivery company. Will try to contact Amazon and do a complaint. After spending so many hours I wish I had simply canceled my order and went to the store."

"Waiting for a reel of cable, no more than 18 inches by 18 inches by 12 inches in dimensions and no more than 15 pounds in weight. The old and tired 'excuse' was the pandemic disruption but I have been told by a purolator employee that they are not to use that excuse any longer. The new useless excuse is 'Oversized' from the tracking page and the new excuse from customer service is 'the package requires special handling' for the safety of their employees. So perhaps they should set the reel on one of its flat surfaces instead of its curved edge, and it will stop rolling over their employees feet. AAAGGGHHH!"
"If I could give zero stars I would.
We are a business located on a highway outside of a rural SK town where the Purolator delivery truck is within a handful of kilometres of us in two different directions, but refuses to provide delivery services to us. We used to have delivery, then they temporarily changed the route several years ago and have refused to change it back. We receive deliveries from DHL, Fed Ex and UPS without any issue at all.

We are at the point where we avoid ordering from companies that ship via Purolator if they can't choose a different carrier. Companies that can choose a different courier get to keep our business. We simply have no option considering these companies are paying Purolator for a service they're not getting (they pay for their packages to come to us, but that's not what happens).

I have contacted Purolator customer service multiple times, their reps have confirmed we should have service here, pass us on to the regional manager who passes us on to the closest-to-us depot and any hope for resolution abruptly ends. It's a waste of time, every time.

I hope companies are reading these reviews and understand that they need to use anyone but Purolator if they want their customers to be happy. Repeatedly picking a courier that fails to do their job reflects on the company sending the product too."

"They didn't want to deliver my package due to a missing buzzer code, now I have to pick it up.

Why do I pay such expensive shipping costs if you can't even go the extra mile to, i don't know, call me since you have my number on file, look at the registry for my name, or SOMETHING.

Nah man, gotta leave that note, gotta make the customer do the work for us, screw actually delivering something."

"I honestly do not like leaving negative reviews but this company is just pathetic. Every time something ships with them, they never ring the bell when they are at my house and instead just leave a notice to come drive 20km to pick it up.

I had an item ship with them and I was downstairs during the time they said they attempted delivery and no one even rung the bell and I checked my camera later and it showed the driver just leave a notice without even trying to make an attempt to deliver the item.

I told them to reschedule delivery and just leave the item at my door, and once again they didn't leave the item and told me to come pick it up, nor did the driver even attempt to ring the bell and wait.

They seriously need to get their act together, cause this is just pathetic. No one wants to drive across town to pick up a parcel cause your drivers are too lazy to attempt delivery."

I swear their drivers don't even get out of the van. I leave a note RIGHT BESIDE the buzzer telling the driver which # to buzz and I get a notification that they don't have a buzzer number!

"This company needs to get its act together. Of over two thousand reviews, 95% of people here gave it one star. That's shameful.

Purolator was suppose to deliver a package yesterday. Tracking said it hadn't been delivered then suddenly it says there was a delivery attempt at 9:57 am. What? I was here at 9:57. Heck I had been sitting near my phone and door all morning. No note. Nothing. We called them and after some disgruntled customer service ppl, they said they would deliver Thursday. Okay. So it came...today.

Wed.

What? How is that Thursday? Because it was a large package, I did not have the elevator to our condo covered that day. If the package scratched it, I'd be charged $250. But Purolator told me they'd come Thursday, so that's when I booked the cover.

If that is not bad enough, I find the package leaning precariously in my hallway. A tall tower ready to fall and break or worse, hurt dogs and children who maneuver around the hall.

Most idiotic company ever. Amazon should boycott them. Period."

"If there is an option to put zero star I would do it. Literally a joke. So I was expecting a package a while ago and it said “on vehicle for delivery” at 8:30AM. So I waited and waited then nothing came. I called their customer service around 6PM and I spoke with a lady who looked into it on where the delivery truck/van is, she told me it will arrive soon since the vehicle is close to where our address is. Checked the tracking info 30mins later and all of a sudden it changed to delivery due September 16 and there’s a note: “DELAYED DUE TO MISSED DELIVERY” WHAT A JOKE! Well, let’s see if it will arrive tomorrow or else I will leave a bad review every freaking day that my package doesn’t get delivered."

"Incredibly frustrated with Purolator's customer service, and if I could leave negative stars, I would have.

Spent all day Friday waiting for an urgent package, only to be told it can't be delivered due to time constraints. When I called to confirm, they advised that it would be delivered ASAP on the next business day (Monday), and ""apologized"" for the inconvenience. They also recommended I don't hold for delivery, as it would just delay me getting the package. Today was told that they actually can't deliver it, and it needs to be sent to a depot for pickup, which is likely going to take another whole week given how terrible this service is. It's bad enough that its not being delivered on-time, but consistently being told by customer service representatives that there is nothing more they can do, and then being supplied with completely erroneous information, is just unacceptable."

"I ordered something from Amazon and it was delivered by the worst delivery company ever existed on Earth. Yesterday, this BS company said they couldn't get a hold of me despite calling their customer service hotline ( took an hour ) and provided all the informations. Their representative said they would never call when they arrive your house. This lousy company have some ridiculous policy to which they won't let their employees use their phone and contact us when they arrived. On the second day, the driver left my apartment without leaving a notice slip. On the third day, they pretend they can't find my address no more and steal my order. Luckily Amazon is well-awared of this BS company and already took action to them. So guys don't worry if you use Amazon and don't want to ever see pUrOlaTOr aka 1 star review among 2500 customers, contact Amazon and tell them to De prioritize this BS company and refer to the Trustpilot reviews. Also, don't reply to me Purolator. I hope one day we Canadians will write a petition to the government and tell em to wipe the shxt out of your company without a trace. Fxxx U"
"When I Get Purolator Tracking Info,
I Immediately REORDER from a different company..
knowing, I will NEVER get my package..
as my last name on every parcel i order,
I write ""WILL NOT PICK UP""
so basically, it says JOE WILL NOT PICK UP
EVERY parcel I order, I always make a Note:
DO NOT SHIP VIA PUROLATOR, WILL NOT PICK UP
I've blocked purolator's phone numbers from my phone.. my parcel should be delivered, under NO circumstance should they ever phoned me..
under NO circumstance.. should I ever be On here or complaining to custumer service for my parcel, which I've paid good money,
to have delivered to MY, ADDRESS !!!
POST CANADA, INTELICOM, FEDEX, USPS, UPS deliver to me, every single day, as many as 30 parcels a week... ON TIME !!!!!!!! EVERY TIME

but purolator, NEVER.. EVER ever DELIVERS MY PARCEL.. SO I've completly boycott them.... and make TRIPLE sure that who ever I order from does NOT USE purolator and if they do, I MAKE SURE to let them know they've just lost my buisness... which they usually reply via email a few days later with alternative shipping options...
if everyone did the same thing.. I guarantee you Purolator would quickly change their tune and start DELIVERING packages like they're hired and paid to do... the only reason they get away with it.. is because you, the customer, put up with it.."

"NEGATIVE 5 STARS :)

Package says delivered but hmm I still have no package. The tracking number and customer service is useless because nothing changes. Whatever that tracking number says, that’s it. If it says delivered but it didn’t that’s your reality and it most likely won’t change. The illusion is real out here...maybe David Blaine is the founder of this company because you have me fooled.

I can send my tracking number 1000s times, but the customer center never give any help. They said they will assign ""specialiest"" to track my package, but they never did, I couldnt get any help, and no messege after that. They are just waiting me to forget about it while they pretend to help me."

"I had a parcel delivered to my apartment today. It was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago but I had an appointment and couldn’t be home. When I passed my order to the store I specified that I was in a wheelchair and was very sick of 2 illnesses which doctors and specialists don’t know much about so that means no treatment no cure. The person doing the delivery was thoughtful enough not to leave a card for me to go pick it up. I can’t go out except for specialists appointments. The person came back today and called me before getting here to make sure I was home and to ask if I could come down and I told him that it would be hard for since the building is not adapted for disabled people. He said that he would come up and not to worry about a thing. Once he got to my apartment he had a beautiful smile and asked me if I was ok and if everything was good in case I needed help and gave me my parcel. He was the most caring person I have met in a long long time. He was caring and had a warm way of making me feel good instead of looking at me with pity like most delivery people that comes here. And I order everything online not being able to go out. He is a warm and charming person that carrier services should have more of people like him doing this job. He was amazing and I can’t thank him enough for the amazing service he provided helping me because of my situation. I don’t have his name unfortunately, but if he reads this the lady in the wheelchair with the two chihuahuas is thanking you for the amazing service. You are a great man and we need more of you in this world.
Thank you so much! Don’t ever change."
"This has been the worst shipping service I have ever encountered. I had ordered on 08/15 and my shipment arrived in my local area quite quick on 08/24. However, I have had this notice ""Unable to deliver - Heavyweight. Customer will be contacted to arrange delivery"" ever since and have received no delivery arrangement call to date. There was even a point where my shipment was going to be returned to sender for no apparent reason. Customer service is lousy; no one can tell me where my shipment is; and I'm still waiting for this delivery call. If I ever come across Purolator again as the shipper for my item, I'm going to cancel my order."

Notified me that my package from Canadian Tire was delivered on my front door but it wasn’t. Me and my husband was home so we immediately checked our front door. There was no delivery made. Reported the incident to costumer service but they closed the case immediately claiming and insisting that the item was delivered on my front door.

"Absolutely terrible service. The item supposed to have been delivered last week. Driver was far less then truthful and claimed an unsuccessful delivery attempt. I was home at the time he claimed delivery attempt. The driver did not even show up. I called CS and was told the item would be delivered the FOLLOWING WEEK. First they claimed I lived in an apartment and didnt provide the apartment number. In fact, live in a house 20 ft from a main road. Then they claimed there was an accident outside my house that prevented the driver from making his delivery. I looked out my window and debunked this fallacy. There was no accident and traffic was as normal. They asked me if I would be willing to come pick it up. Of course I said no. Then I got a message to call and confirm my address. I did.

Now the following week, they claim my address is wrong so they cant deliver it. My address is correct and confirmed it with CS. Item #DCM014350161.
Now I lose out on the item i really wanted because of poor service on behalf of this company."

"I have not had any company that I have ever dealt with that offers worse customer service than Purolator. A package was delivered to us from a business 30 minutes away. Rather than ringing our doorbell, the delivery person just left a slip. This is not the first time they have done this. We could pick up the package in Brantford- 60 minutes away from us! Yet, we live just outside Kitchener, 10 minutes from a Purlator office, and only 1 minute from a post office. Calling their 1-888-SHIP-123 number does not work, we tried several times. We called their 1-800-387-3027 number. After a 20 minute wait, we gave up. Then we tried their on-line assistance: another disaster, a CSR was supposed to contact us via E-mail, but never did. We finally told the person that send us the package to retract it, and send it to us by any other means. NEVER will we use this useless service again, we never have ANY problems with any of the other couriers. Total disaster!"

"Is this the worst run business on the planet? A couch I was having delivered from Wayfair sat in the Victoria sorting facility for over a week before I asked them to put a trace on it. A few days later they got back to me and said the couch had already been delivered! Well, if it was delivered, it wasn't delivered to me. When I asked for details about the delivery, they said to my amazement that the drivers use a manual input system to make deliveries. Are you kidding me? In 2020 they write down delivery info manually, pen and paper? Get real. You don't have to be a genius to figure out the potential for errors and abuse with that kind of system. It also gives Purolator an easy way out of accepting accountability for lost and miss-delivered items. From what I've been able to see, there are scores of similar complaints from other dissatisfied Purolator victims.

If I don't have the couch, then where in blazes is it? Either find my couch, or refund my full shipping cost. This company deserves to be investigated for its' systemic pattern of wrongdoings and ""above the law' business practices.

I cannot believe it that purolator is a bad company to deal with. If i could just give zero star I would but I don’t have choice. I was outside our building yesterday waiting for my package because its in my tracking device thru amazon that they going to deliver it today instead of Friday and saw the purolator vehicle across the street which I thought the package is going to deliver. I did not get it. And called today Friday they said its in the depot and they cannot deliver it because the driver already left. Wow amazing huh? The driver have the all day to deliver isn’t it? I spoke with them early in the morning but still they cannot do anything. I will never use this purolator ever. Just Frustrating.

But this company has failed me more times than I can count. I would never choose them myself. Unfortunately companies like Amazon do, and I have complained to them directly, too. It isn't just that Purolator doesn't seem to give a damn, it appears they regularly go out of their way to inconvenience customers without a shred of compunction and actually do everything possible to make things more difficult. Horrendous from start to finish, guaranteed, every single time."
"after reading reviews i was super nervous it would be a hassle to get my package but i guess i got lucky ? because they sent me text updates with the progress of my package and texted me when it was outside, nobody knocked they just left it at my front door which was nice for me! i give my experience 5 stars."
I have been waiting for my office chair delivery for 2 weeks. Tracking says it has been sitting at the etobicoke depot. Terrible delivery company. I never get my packages on time and have been waiting for my office chair suffering from major back pain. I Telework from home and it is essential I receive this item. I WILL NEVER USE PUROLATOR AS MY DELIVERY COMPANY AGAIN. They don't care about their customers. UPDATE -Recieved my delivery today and they left my chair on my driveway did not attempt to ring my door bell and left me with a damaged chair. Wheels were missing and chair was dirty. How can they even be in business with this kind of service. Disgusting!
"I ordered a package during my 14 day self-isolation and for several days in a row they have left the same ""sorry, we missed you"" slip at my mailbox. There is zero excuse for claiming I am unavailable as I am legally bound to my address for two weeks straight. Normally I'd happily go to the office to pick up my package, even when they lie about me being unavailable, but this time I cannot make it within 5 business days as I cannot leave my address. I called their customer service and told them to schedule a redelivery, making it clear that I cannot leave my address and that all they need to do is leave it outside my door. They said I could give a verbal signature from a distance which would have worked fine if they had been bothered. I've now had to resort to scheduling a redelivery every single day for 6 days straight just so I don't have my package sent back to the SAQ and so I can pick up my package once I'm out of self-isolation. Absolutely insane that this is the easiest way to deal with the situation. So inconsiderate and unhelpful for those in isolation. Thanks for nothing Purolator."

"My story would be a regurgitation of the 3,000 reviewers leaving 1 star. I'm going to share a solution, since Purolator does not provide one.

‼️ASK AMAZON TO DEPRIORITIZE📉 PUROLATOR AS A CARRIER ON YOUR ACCOUNT‼️

This works best when you have an existing order that has failed to deliver on time. Take the following steps:
1. View ""Your Orders""
2. Select the order that has failed to deliver
3. Depending on how far out the delivery has been missed, you should see a ""Contact Us"" option, select it.
4. Select the reason: ""Where's my stuff""
5. Select the next relevant option, usually ""Shipment is late""
6. This will give you 2 options to get in touch with amazon: Phone or Chat. Pick one
7. Explain to the Amazon rep your problem, cite TrustPilot's 1-star rating from 95% of 3,000 reviews for Purolator
8. They will offer to refund, you may be interested if you don't expect to see your purchased merchandise ever being delivered by Purolator
9. Ask the rep to ""deprioritize Purolator as a carrier on my account""
10. They will easily accept this request (they are already familiar with the carrier's failures), and it will take 3-5 business days to apply.

Moving forward, you should no longer have to deal with this company, and with enough people opting out, this should trigger a signal for management to reconsider their relationship with the carrier."

"Ordered office equipment from HP as I am working from home during the pandemic. Was told delivery would be Monday, Aug. 31st. The tracker said it was out for delivery. Waited most of the day, poor dogs got very short walks, and around 6:30 I see the truck go by. Checked everywhere and nothing. Now I see it is to be delivered tomorrow. Again the dogs are going to suffer."

"I had 3 large items ordered from Amazon (on 3 separate tracking numbers). I made specific instructions to deliver Monday-Friday after 5:00pm or Saturday-Sunday. I get a call from them saying they tried to deliver one of the item and I wasn't there at which I informed them of when I'm available. Their response is they don't deliver after 5 or on the weekends. I told them that if they call me 10 min ahead of time I will be able to get the item. The representative said ok. I call them about an hour later to make sure that they can do the same thing for the other 2 items. And low and behold ""we don't call before delivery"". Spoke with the supervisor, he told me drivers were getting in accidents for using the phone so they don't do that anymore. I told him when the items need to be delivered he said call amazon as they have a contract with them apparently. Placing blame on others. Then I called amazon, told them about the situation. The amazon representative called them and they still didn't honor anything. Funny part is, she was told that they don't call customers because it's up to the drivers to use their personal phones.

TLDR
They are liars."
"Hello Roman,

Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for the inconveniences. For a regular service, the delivery is during the day. Due to high volumes, a time frame is not available unfortunately. If the service is available in your area, you can request the sender to specifically select the evening or the weekend deliveries. They must choose one of these options when the shipment was being prepared to be shipped.

For the same security reasons that you were already explained, our delivery personnel are not equipped with company mobile phones. Therefore, the drivers are unable to call or text.

Every single time they have handled one of my packages they have lost them. And for my most recent experience it was the same problem.

"i have never had a successful delivery with purolator.
not one!
they don't know how to use the buzzer, they didn't even leave a slip on the last delivery, just an email i received while sitting at home all day waiting for them.
seriously they expect me to travel 12km to pick up my parcel, and i live in downtown Toronto.
whats the point of ordering anything online, when Walmart is 2km away?

just an hour after writing this i had a knock on my door, an order from amazon, a parcel arrived right to my apartment door!
not from purolator.
every single courier service has a 100% success rate delivering to me, so why is purolator 0for10 thus far?
even uber eats gets it right.
not only do they have my buzz code i also gave special instruction with the secret code which automatically opens the door
i contacted purolator to let them know this, and the lady said :well.. were not uber eats"" (in a condescending manner)I said ""THAT'S RIGHT YOU'RE NOT, THEY HAVE MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS THAN YOU!


in response to below.
no i am through with your company, i will no longer accept or do business with any company who uses your service.
i have instructed Amazon to never send a parcel using your service, and they have de-prioritized you to any orders i make with them from now on.
any order i make from now on that sends me a purolator tracking number will immediately be cancelled."

Only reason I'm even giving them one star is because I HAVE to select something.... They're not even deserving of one star. Spoke with two different representatives over two days and both just fed me lies and excuses and then tried to turn it around and blame it on ME. they took zero responsibility in the situation and as a result my package will not be edible by the time it arrives to me. I didn't pay a crap ton of money on expedited shipping to receive something I'm most likely going to have to throw in the trash when/(IF) it gets here. Grow up and accept some f***ing responsibility for YOUR mistake. And maybe invest some more time/resources into your customer service. As someone who works in customer service I am appalled by the service I recieved.

"I've only gotten deliveries from them twice and both times have been bad experiences. This time, my package was specifically set to require a signature for security, the person sending it even paid extra. The delivery guy shows up, doesn't check my ID or ask me to sign just goes ""here you go buddy"" and puts the package into my hands before taking off. On top of that, the box is soggy because another package they most likely mishandled and broke spilled onto it. To sum up what this company is: absolute trash. Please just close down already Purolator.

"For the 2nd time since March 2020, another Purolator ""delivered"" package has gone missing. That's 2 of my packages, from 2 different vendors. After the hassle of dealing with both vendors, I called Purolator to ASK that they hold my REPLACEMENT package being sent to me from the 2nd vendor. I am willing to drive to the Purolator depot and pick up my REPLACEMENT package myself. The customer service rep, who was polite, informed me that Purolator's policy is to attempt delivery, at least once, before agreeing to hold your package for pickup.

At this point, that is unacceptable to me. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor reiterated the same information. After some back and forth, he reluctantly agreed to hold my package for pickup. He did his level best to defend, as he has to, but I can only imagine how many complaint calls he has to field from day-to-day. Given the sheer volume of complaints on this thread alone, his job must be a very busy one nowadays.***

At this point, Purolator is FULLY AWARE that they have VERY SERIOUS INTERNAL ISSUES. I would hope that they are actively working to fix whatever is happening...whether it is poor operational policies that need to be changed, or potentially, an issue of dishonesty involving some of their employees...but there is definitely something WRONG.

As suggested by another commenter, I will be verifying ALL future online purchases, to make certain that PUROLATOR, or any of their potential sub-contractors, are NOT responsible for delivery of my items. If so, I will not place orders with those vendors.

I've received ALL packages delivered by Canada Post, Amazon, etc...the only ""missing"" packages were sent via Purolator. You decide for yourselves what may have happened.

PUROLATOR'S MISSION:
""Promises made, promises delivered."" When you CANNOT keep your promises, I think it's time for a revision of the company vision.

THIS IS NOT A HASSLE (x2, in a few short months) THAT I WANT OR NEED. Not now, not in the future.

I would be interested to know the TRUE percentage, or volume, of missing packages.
Purolator knows these numbers, but are they willing to repair that damage they've inflicted upon themselves?

QUESTION:
Can this STILL be considered a TRUSTED courier/delivery service?

*** I will update on follow-through, and whether I ACTUALLY receive my package this time. I'm at the mercy of this customer service manager's promise to hold my package for pickup (though, he shouldn't have to, nor should I have to make this request, or travel to pick up my own package).

My advice?
When Purolator's involved, don't involve yourself."

"My package has completely vanished. Contacted customer service chat regarding my package tracking number not working and received a response that the sender could contact them next week.
I live the other side of the city from the sender's warehouse location. This package should have been delivered within a single day. Even regular Canada Post service would have been capable of delivering this package faster. Waiting a week for Purolator to even allow the sender to talk with them or reach out to confirm details with the sender, is ludicrously slow.

Their online customer service rep was dismissive and unwilling to escalate the situation effectively to get the matter resolved. They closed the chat on me without resolving my problem. All and all a terrible customer service experience that has shattered my trust in this carrier."

"I use Purolator for our business needs from time to time, at least 4-5 times a month up until last week, I had to send an urgent order out. It was 2 pieces weighing about 90lbs in total. Longest piece being 10ft long by 2"" in thickness and 2"" wide. Apparently because this piece is one foot over the maximum size which I did not know about nor was I advised by a rep when I dropped off the shipment, I got a $900 charge on my bill for Over Size Max Limit, which customer service refuses to take off my bill or even reduce it to a reasonable amount. Will never use this company again no matter how urgent it is. My total bill was 1,396.00 for a two piece, 90lb shipment. What a rip-off."

21 days later packages were returned to sender instead of being delivered like purolator was paid to!!

21 days later my packages were returned to sender instead of being delivered to my door, like purolator was paid to do!!
address was all good, all info was good, they held it hostage at a depot for 3 weeks.. rather than deliver it to my address like they were paid to.. harassing me everyday, asking me to come pick up my parcels at their depot... why was it at their depot?????
when they were paid to deliver it to my address.. that's criminal.. and then you've got customer service on here, this site, asking me to contact them.. FOR WHAT !?? it easy as pie.... PICK up PARCEL at address ""A"" and deliver it, at address ""B"" ..... VERY VERY SIMPLE every single, other courrier company does it... every parcel should be delivered.. there's NO ADDRESS ""C"" your depot was never agreed upon !!!! WHY WAS MY PARCEL AT YOUR DEPOT !???? THAT's STRAIGHT OUT THEFT !!!! those are my goods.. my belongings.. that you were hired and paid to deliver to address ""B"" where are they??
they should have been on my doorsteps 18 days ago !!! NO PHONE CALLS or harassment from you!.. HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS.. that's totally criminal !!! I should have the RCMP file theft charges... or some sort of investigation.. is this the publicity you want?? DELIVERING PACKAGES IS THE BUISNESS YOU""RE IN, HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY NOT DOING WHAT YOU'RE HIRED AND PAID TO DO???? IT'S JUST ONE SIMPLE TASK ?!?!?
just ask yourself... if you personally pay to have something delivered to you.. would you go pick it up... and have them keep all your money?? what if you ordered a pizza.. and the driver phone you to ask you to come pick it up half way.. after you've already paid the delivery fee?!?!? would you go pick it up?? what if you don't have a car.. hence the reason you got a delivery in the first place.. once of a thousand reasons.... I have upward of 10 packages delivered to my door every week.. no phone calls no hassles my packages are always on my doorstep or in my mailbox..
with EVERYONE but you !...
please send this message all the way up to management.. as i will be sending a copy of it to every news and media source i can find on the internet across NORTH AMERICA... i will ask the rcmp to investigate.. as well as the better buisness bureau.. and the several obudsman.. this is ridiculous.. this has happened way to many times.. to the point where I make sure with every company i deal with, that they do no use purolator.. and write on the package do not ship via purolator.. but somehow you guys manage to hijack it.. steal it.. and end up with it... after doing everything in my power assuring me you would never touch that parcel.. but yet you still do !!!! HOW ?????
if you don't intend to deliver a parcel..
DON'T TOUCH IT !!!! leave it for a company that will do the task it's hired and paid to do !

"Paid for delivery to my condo suite, and the delivery person would not deliver to the door. We had several deliveries in my building and this delivery man made everyone meet him by his delivery truck. I asked, “what is the process for larger items that require a dolly?” He he just said I don’t have a mask, and I have a heart condition” I told him I cannot carry a large parcel without a dolly and by myself, nor can I leave my baby in his crib by himself ....that is why I opted for delivery!!
He shrugged his shoulders like a damn idiot.

Purolator, here’s a suggestion. When accepting orders from Amazon or any other seller that is delivering to a condo or building, state that you do not deliver to the receivers suite. Give us an option to back out of doing business with you.

I am returning my item to Amazon and calling their customer service to report this, with this very reason behind it. I will buy local when I am able to go to the store to do so.

I hope amazon reads this because I will be thinking twice on ordering from Amazon due to this delivery experience. Hopefully Amazon can offer a solution to this.

***UPDATE***
Contacted Purolator customer service yesterday with the tracking number and was told that there is nothing they can do. Drivers do not have to go into the building. That is fine, I have informed Amazon on this and asked that Purolator be removed from all deliveries on my account. I will also notify my neighbors who live in my condo that this is an option on their future deliveries."

"I bought a piece of electronics back in July 2020, but, I decided to return this back to the seller. I was provided with a prepaid return shipping label from the seller so I used this to return my package - just standard process. Upon dropping off my package at one of the official Purolator drop-off locations, I was not provided with a receipt or any form of confirmation to confirm that my package was dropped off - the clerk refused to provide one and told me to go home and check online to inquire the about status. Apparently, that is their return-package process, which is odd because Canada post would normally provide a receipt when you drop off any sort of packages. Having never dealt with Purolator before and seeing that the clerk was annoyed at my simple question (I was genuinely curious!) and seeing that the customer in front of me didn't receive a receipt either, I didn't want to press further on the issue and accepted their verbal confirmation. The whole situation made me feel very uneasy as I felt that there is a gap in their where things could obviously go wrong due to their weak internal controls. Two weeks later, my return package still has not been received by the recipient on the other end. I checked the tracking on the return label and to my surprise (surprised that it went missing, not not so surprised of their weak controls), there was no confirmation of me dropping the package off to Purolator. Today, I checked with the office where I dropped off my package and the clerk there claims my package was never dropped off at their office - WHAT IN THE WORLD!!?! I have contacted corporate Purolator and hoping they'll help me resolve this issue. Now I'm worried that I'll be out by $400 that was out of my control.

Purolator, please kindly improve your drop-off process - there are obvious gaps where packages can easily go missing without any traces."

"I bought shoes from Vans, who enclosed a pre-paid Purolator Ground return label (they created the label on Aug. 8). I packed up the shoes with the return packing label and used their prepaid shipping label to the outside. The closest drop off Purolator pick-up location that I found off your website was Double Double Convenience located at 927 Bloor St. W., Toronto. I dropped off the package around 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 16. When I entered the convenience store, there were two people -- maybe in their late teens, early 20s, male and female -- behind the counter. The man told me to leave the parcel in the pile of other packages on the floor which also had prepaid labels. Not having dealt with Purolator's drop-off protocols before, I left the parcel there. The man did not offer to scan my package or provide a receipt. I was told the Purolator driver would come later that day and scan the packages. But when I did not see movement with tracking online later that day and then the next day, I became concerned. Usually, when I drop Canada Post packages off, they scan at the post office and provide a receipt. Here, I was not given an option. If this package has indeed become lost or stolen, then I'm out nearly $200. It’s been a week now and they’ve opened up a trace investigation but no updates so far. If I would have known there is no liability on the company, I would have just gone direct to the Vans store to return the shoes."

"I didn’t receive my packages from Purolator. It’s the second time the same thing has happened. In the same operation, the deliveryman wrote a notice and threw it in the mailbox and left without knocking at all. For the first time, I knew the delivery day, I had been waiting at home all day. When I went out, I saw the driver driving away and found the notice in the mailbox. This time, all my family members are at home during COVID-19 epidemic, and I don’t know when they came. I found the notice at the bottom of the mailbox at the door. Usually the post office or express notices was placed on the door handle.

"I have a package and stay at home all day. They didn't even leave a notice at my front door, never called. Then asked me to pick up at their centre which is far far away from my house. I didn't own a car and they just make everything difficult. Can't they just make a call to the customer if there is delivery issue? I received call from Canada Post, UPS when they deliver my item. Will never ever use Purolator for delivery. Sad with your service."
"Hi MC,

We are able to arrange another delivery for you. Please forward your tracking number to us through email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"I just don’t understand how all other courier services can bring packages on time and undamaged, yet Every. Single. Time a supplier sends via Purolator I get “your package will still arrive, just later than expected” three times my items haven’t shown up at all! And it’s not simply a bit later than expected, it’s me calling to try and track my stuff down, dealing with rude customer service, getting no answers then finding my stuffs gone to the mining museum! Why?!

The world would be a better place without Purolator in it. Much less frustration for everyone. Please for the love of god use Fed-ex or UPS. Boycott Purolator till they can provide a service worth paying for."
"Hi Laura,

We apologize for the negative experience you've had with Purolator. Please feel free to reach out to us through email at customer.care@purolator.com if you need any further assistance with your shipment. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
The worst costumer service you will ever deal with. Absolute crap!! Call your costumers or leave a note when the shipment arrives!!! Specially if it’s precious metals. You guys are worthless .. now I get to wait another 2 months because u guys are full of crap and useless
"Hi Robert,

Our drivers should be leaving a notice of attempted delivery when the receiver is unavailable. I am sorry if a notice was not left. We are unaware of the contents of the parcel. Please let us know if there is anything further we can assist you with. We are available through email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
Absolutely the worst customer service ever! Not only can they not have a system that can accurately update the status of your delivery- but their Virtual Chat needs to go or learn to communicate with what is actually happening to your delivery. This being in limbo in the virtual world is like being in outer space. And after being on hold for over 2 hrs to talk to a human - they still don’t get my package redirected to the shipper & try to deliver to me again! Or you may be lucky enough to to speak with someone via twitter as understanding & helpful like Catherine or have the misfortune of dealing with Vanessa! That girl needs to have the meaning of customer service explained to her. I hope one day someone treats her the way she treated me today! Unacceptable & very in professional. I work in customer service industry & if I were to write to people the way she did I would be fired!! If any of my future orders get delivered by purolator & I will refuse & send back to the shipper (TSC/Amazon etc) DK
"Hi Donna,

"If I could give minus 5 star rating to this company I would. They don't allow their drivers to have phones to contact the customer and so I never know when my package will arrive and my building does not have a buzzer for them to call. Every time they are selected by amazon to deliver my package, I always have to go pick up my package so delivery is NOT guaranteed with them. I don't understand how they are still in business ... Personally, I wish amazon did not use them for residential delivery services so this can be avoided."
"Hello Ana Maria,

Thank you for this review. We're sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction. For security reasons, our delivery personnel are not equipped with company mobile phones.

"Rude support on the phone. I wasn't upset at all, I just wanted some information on what my options were after a delivery failed... A lot of attitude from the agent for asking questions about how to avoid failed deliveries in the future in an apartment building and how redelivering works. It's a shame that respect on the phone is too much to expect from this company."

Every single time i'm expecting a package delivered by purolator, they f*cked up somwhere and i've to make a 1h30 public transport trip in order to go get my package cause they refuse to put it in a post office as every other delivery service. Purolator is by far the worst delivery service ever."

When you deliver something to an apartment, if there is a buzz code, don't you know that you can press the apartment number to call the receiver and then he can let you in? They even don't try to do that, just saying address wrong, need correction. What a stupid company!"

"Brutal Tracking System ! Get with the era of technology!
So I ordered an expensive item from Princess Auto and and observed that it had been shipped via Purolator HOWEVER it said tracking number "" not available"". So after 10 days i tried using the Purolator virtual assistant but without a tracking # it told me to call customer service which i did and after waiting 30 minutes on hold the lady said ohhh we cant do anything without a tracking # .. ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?? Can't do anything with a name, address, phone # ?? no......its the year 2020...what a useless system Purolator has ! They tell me to contact Princess Auto because its their fault ! so on no fault of mine, i have probably lost my package now...thanks Derrick Morrissey, Sudbury"
"Hello Derrick,

Thank you for taking the time to write this review. We're sorry to hear about your disappointment. Unfortunately, tracking a shipment by name or address is not available for the moment.

"When I first saw the overwhelmingly negative reviews (along with my friend's experiences) I had some worry since my package was worth about $300, but it ended up arriving a day early. The tracking needs improvement, it told me my package was in sorting across the country for 5 days, then all of the sudden on the 6th day I got an update saying it was on a delivery truck headed my way and sure enough it arrived not too long after. Never told me when it flew across the country."

"Hello John,

Thank you for taking the time to write this review. We're sorry for the inconveniences caused by the delay. Due to high volumes and physical distancing during this pandemic, deliveries of heavy and/or oversize shipments may take a few extra days.

"This has got to be the worst shipping company on the planet. This is now the third time my parcel(s) have been delayed when using Purolator. I haven't experienced this with any other courier service. This company quite simply doesn't do the ONE job that is expected of them. Take a package from point a and deliver it to point b! If there are any delays, deploy customer service and contact the customer in a timely manner to resolve the issue. This company fails so completely at their mission statement it's unbelievable. It's really just embarrassing! I will never trust Purolator in the future. This company needs to get their act together. Pathetic!!!"

"I had to put one star but really they deserve 0 stars. Waited all day yesterday for an Amazon package through this delivery service. Then late in the day when I went down to get my mail there was a notice tacked on the entrance door that said ""Sorry we missed you"" and that my package would be held at a depot 5 blocks from my house. The delivery person never even tried to buzz me or phone to say he was down in the lobby. There is also a huge sign from management telling delivery people to leave the packages in the lobby (and there were several sitting there) but, no, the driver was too lazy to intercomm me or leave the parcel in the lobby. Now I have to trek over 5 blocks to get the parcel and I have mobility issues so this is not an easy jaunt for me. WORST COMPANY WITH LAZY DELIVERY PEOPLE AND NO HELP FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE. I too have written to Amazon telling them not to use this company. I hope Amazon will listen as I will not order anything from them that is delivered via Purolator."

"I’ll be honest. I live 1 hour outside of Etobicoke. I ordered a mattress in a box from Amazon. I understand that it is a little larger than usual, and I’m not an unreasonable person. However, when I am told from Amazon that it will be delivered at a time, and additional 2 days from a location 1 hours away is acceptable. We are now on extra day 9 plus the original purchase date July 31. 15 days and still not delivered. I call and talk to the customer service people and get “it’s delayed” and when asked the estimated time of delivery, the answer is “I don’t know”. So let me get this straight, you have my product sitting in Etobicoke for 15 days and no idea when it will be delivered. My last conversation was “Wait till Monday, if there is no update to then I will track it”. Huh? You have been tracking it, according to your website it’s sitting there. What I don’t understand I have gotten larger boxes with heavier things in 24 to 48 hours from UPS and FedEX from a further distance, yet a pick up in Etobicoke to My house in the same province is delayed with no plan to deliver. This isn’t a company I will ever deal with again, and I have written a formal complaint to Amazon in regards to this lack of respect for purchased products. Amazon needs to leave these guys in find a more reputable courier service. How a company can hold products at ransom for no real reason it becomes apparent they don’t care."

"I originally thought that purolator should also have the buzzer key for my apartment since it is owned by Canada Post and they do have the key which means that I don't need to provide the buzzer code to them. The worst thing here is that they will not phone you for any problems that are related to your package. It can be a thing that is easily solved by a $300 device but that does not exist. From what I know they will not understand the complaints and leave the problems there not fixed. My plan is affected and delayed by this incident and I will strongly suggest amazon prime not tu use purolator for your third party carriers anymore but use your own Amazon delivery or UPS or Canada Post.

---------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:
Online agents are nice and friendly, but after I have uploaded the new buzzer code and sit my ass all day at home to wait for the package, it is still ""ATTEMPTED DELIVERY"" lol. Just talked to an online agent and sent the request to return it to Amazon. Please avoid this company and thank you very much. I legit saw their truck but they told me that receiver is not avaliable like what lol. But whatever wish I can give them a negative score."
"Hello Jerry,

Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this incident. Since, unlike Canada Post, we do not have the key, the buzzer coded is essential to reach you at the time of the delivery. If we don't have this information, the shipment will be taken back to the depot where our resolution team will call you to obtain the missing info. If no phone number was provided on the label, we'll still hold it for 5 business days. Asking the driver to try to resolve every single address issues on the spot would take considerate time and put in jeopardy the rest of the pickup and delivery operations.

Purolator is the worst courier company. I chose no stars because a delivery that I was expected to get 5 days ago has still not arrived. Know one seems to know their job. Very bad communication with employees and drivers. Misinformation of incorrect info. The delivery driver lied about not only attempted to deliver to my office but having the incorrect address. I have called them 2 to 3 times a day to verify my info and delivery on that day and I am yet to receive my package. After giving them details of the hours of operation the supervisor told me it's not guaranteed at that time frame. For God sake it's been 5 damn days. I will never again use this courier company and will strongly suggest everyone to find a better courier company if you want to receive your package and with no excuses and lies.

"I dont want to give even a star!!!! it is 2020 and still they deliver without scheduling , call or email! so clients set home and wait for the notice! I went to pick up my order from their location to find out there were 13 people in front of me, it took 20 minutes until I was able to get my package. when I left there were 13 people waiting outside! wow great customer service , this is exactly what we want !

--- edit ---
After writing my review, I got an amazing service from Nicolas Lépine. I truly didn't expect to get my package delivered today just because of my previous experience with you. But just one hour ago Nicolas one of your drivers and delivery guys try to call me from his cellphone twice! he had to go the administration office of my building which is located in another building just to get my phone number so he could deliver the package to my door! He didnt even leave it at the admin office because he thought it is too heavy and wanted to help out by delivering it to my door!! how kind and sweet this person. he went beyond his job to help a client . I would give his service 10 stars . but I wouldn't give your delivery system that much , be thankful this guy just saved your rating one star extra. - Quebec"
"Ordered an item through Amazon last weekend. I live just 2 hours of Toronto. We’re almost a week later and my item is still not delivered. First time the item was out, I waited all day at home, only to see at some point in the afternoon that Purolator said a delivery was attempted but no one was at home; I live in an apartment building, the delivery person never even buzzed our apartment number from the lobby. Because Purolator thinks it’s acceptable policy not to equip its delivery teams woth company cellphones, there is of course no way for them to call us when doing a delivery, so they don’t have to make the effort of contacting us and making sure the item can be delivered. There is also no way depots can call them once they’re out, so they can just claim to attempt deliveries when they don’t.

I called the company. I was told the delivery would be done the next day. Hint: that didn’t happen. My item never moved the next day. I called again later that evening and even contacted Amazon. Was told for sure the item would be delivered the next morning. Fast forward to yesterday then. I’ll let you guess. We never received the package. It was out for delivery all day, but again, the delivery never happened. We sat at home, waiting, only to have a message appear at 7:30 PM saying it was now delayed due to the COVID pandemic.

This service is completely unacceptable. Worst couriers ever."

"After reading these comments here i was frustrated first, but everything worked perfectly.i had an order from Amazon and it came on time with Purolator. They knocked the door and gave my parcel. It was nothing like described here. I liked it. That's why i decided to give good ranking."
"Do I have to give a star? How does this company rationalize their execrable (non) service? Like many others, I've ordered a product, a very expensive technical product, via Amazon. First, it sat in Etobicoke for 6 days. Finally, it made it to the west coast, sat in one depot for 2 days, at the next depot it got flagged ""Delayed due to current pandemic disruption"" and again today, same thing.
In the meantime, I've received a half dozen other packages ordered at the same time or later from further away that took 48 hours at the longest -- some under 36 hours (none of those via Purolator).
I agree with Busterfetcher that it looks like Purolator is using Covid to excuse their poor service.
In future my shopping orders or anything else will be predicated on if the company does NOT use Purolator and I'd certainly never use them to serve my customers.

Update: OK, I gave them a chance to resolve the issue and provided the tracking number. Surprise, here's the result:

""Your shipment is delayed due to high volume during this pandemic crisis. Delivery will resume as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are not able to confirm a delivery date at the moment.""

Again, Purolator is the only courier that seems to be affected; I've received half a dozen items, ordered at the same time and later, that were delivered -- by other couriers -- in under 48 hours.

Meanwhile, I've missed a deadline that was contingent on using the product that is in limbo within PuroLATER's awful system.

Update #2
I finally received my package ... but only after days of chasing them to do their job. As above I gave them a chance to track my package and was first rebuffed with the Covid excuse. When I told the respondent ""That's not good enough,"" they referred the issue to a tracer ... who never got back to me.
Finally, I phoned the nearest depot, where it had for 4 days been flagged as ""Delayed by the current pandemic"" with no estimated date of delivery.
Turns out, according to the polite agent there that the local driver had ""had an accident"" some days previously. I got a somewhat different story through the grapevine (from a driver that used to work for Purolator). Anyway, I told them that wasn't my problem -- Get a new driver and vehicle and do the job you're supposed to do -- deliver my package.
It arrived the next day. Not that I would have known if I didn't check my doorstep. They didn't knock or ring the doorbell -- just left my $1500 purchase sitting outside.

So, the suspicion in the title of my review proved to be correct."
"They delivers
""We're sorry we missed you"" instead of actual shipments.

I was sitting at home waiting for my parcel and paid 40 dollars of fees to get my parcel within toronto only and amateur, deaf and lazy delivery guy posted paper on my door without even knocking."

The absolute worst customer service ever...I went into the Total Office Supplies office the other day as one of my customers got a damaged package...This store being an agent for Purolator is how I send...After explaining my situation the rude lady almost smiling told me to contact purolator...In addition I was informed that they dont take purolator guff???? What does that mean...Dont bring any concerns to them...I explained to the one lady to whom I believe was the manager that when a customer brings a concern in atleast looked like you care dont sit there smiling about my misfortune...She then told me if I want an apology or caring I should contact Justin Trudeau...Unbelievable how they are an agent for Purolator...They don't accept Purolator guff or concerns rediculous...Stay away use someone else...They are below a 1 in customer service here...

Update: Have officially hit the 7th day of delay due to being oversized. Contacted company, they have no idea where the package is. a $700 golf club completely missing. PUROLATOR IS PATHETIC.

"Update August 13th 2020
Two days after receiving an answer here from Purolator and a promise of a redelivery attempt the package still was not redeliver and sits in the pick up location far away from my living place
At this point I have no package worth almost $200

Nothing has changed. 1 star only.

The worst as always.
Again, they faked a unsuccessful delivery and left me an aviso when I was at home and ready to pick it up.

You were at my doors, I was at home and you failed with a delivery! Only at Purolator!

Liers, 100% inefficiency.

I am sick and tired with them.

Please disappear from the market.

"I moved to Canada from the UK, bright eyed and bushy tailed ready to take on North America. I have dealt with a cross country move, losing work due to COVID, and struggling with money. Yet Purolator still manages to be the worst thing that I have had to endure since moving. I struggle to find words for how awful their service has been, so I wrote a poem instead:

I click the order button,
my fingers are crossed,
which delivery carrier?
Will my package get lost?

An email comes through,
I see blue and red,
""please be Canada post"",
it's Purolator instead.

I audibly groan,
I start to seeth
I do everything I can,
to not fall down on my knees.

How many delivery attempts?
How long will this take?
Do they have all my info?
For goodness sake.

Now I know,
for the next two weeks,
I will constantly worry,
my outlook is bleak.

A few weeks later,
My parcel was due,
I contact customer support,
my anger to ensue.

I open the chat bot,
His little box face,
greets me with a smile,
I want to put it in it's place.

""Why is my package late"",
I type in frustration,
""I don't understand the question"",
it replies in elation.

""I want to speak to a human""
I'm at the end of my tether,
""I need to gather some information""
This is looking better!

I type in my name,
and email address,
a second window opens,
again I start to stress.

No options to select,
for a chat topic,
My laptop's in hand,
I try not to drop it.

I pick up my phone,
and type in the number,
for customer support,
knowing it might be a bummer.

I get through to someone,
my heart beats faster.
Could this be the one?
Or will it be a disaster?

You guessed it right
and now I have to venture
all the way to
the ""nearest"" Distribution centre.

I open google maps,
to see where they are,
and lo and behold,
you can't get there without a car.

I'm at the end of my rope,
All hope seems lost.
What can I do
without incurring additional costs?

I'm going to leave the poem there so you can be as left in the dark as to what happened next as I am. I would love to say this is an isolated incident, however this is the same circular conversation I have EVERY TIME I have had a delivery with Purolator."

"It should come to the surprise of no one here that Purolator get a 1 star review - that much is a given these days. But what I can never work out is how you can get so many and still be awful, it's insane. My driver turned up to my building with the package onboard, walked up to the concierge, and told them it was ""too heavy"" (41lbs) to get off the truck and then just left.

In normal circumstances that's bad enough, but when you think about what's actually going on here it's even more bewildering. Honestly if you spend any amount of time thinking about the fact he would have had to load the package on to truck to start the day knowing full well he was never going to take it back off again, you would be right in thinking this person might be the worst person at their job in the world. Maybe ever?

Other tidbits:
- They don't give their drivers phones, so they allegedly have 0 methods of contacting their drivers whilst out on delivery. If it's a cost issue may I suggest carrier pigeon?
- If I had to guess, the letters making up the phrase ""I don't know"" must be worn out on the keypads of the live chat workers given how much it is used to answer questions
- Even after being told on the phone they would attempt to deliver it again (lol) I've now been notified it's available to pick up instead... over 10kms away from where I live. Nice.

Seriously, avoid like the plague."

"I have used Purolator many times without problems. Including two weeks ago. I pay extra for Express overnight. Tracking number 14990042492.

I had to have a medical spine brace custom made for compression fractures.

It was taken directly into Purolator (University drive in Toronto) for shipping.
As Purolator admits ""It was their mistake the shipment went by ground and no way to pull it off the truck. The tracking number shows it is still at sorting facility in Toronto. Was told a scan update would happen at 10:00 am. It didn't

I spoke with a manager as I cannot return to work until I have it. Scheduled to go back to work Monday.

Manager says maybe delivery Wednesday.

So I lose my wages.

If they have lost my custom made spine brace. I have too start all over.

Every precaution was taken by going into Purolator to ship (avoiding pick up at alternate location) delivery is also a Purolator location hold for pick up to avoid further delays or loss of it.

Beyond disappointing.

If you have an important item such as I did. I would find stress the express air shipping and stress no mistake of it going by ground instead of air or use another courier."

"It says my packaged was delivered... but i never got a buzzed or a call and I work from home!!!!! So i was home all day.

The package i got was worth $200
I shouldve read the reviews here and asked the company on what courier they use.

This is the VERY first time i had ever lost a package at all. And i always buy online.
This is so frustrating.

Im 100% sure Purolator lost my package... and I’m so mad!

I’m goin to tell everyone i know and spread it to never do buisness with purolator.

"Bad service. First they lost the item in the warehouse, then they wanted to schedule an appointment and waisted 2 days without contacting us. Finally they update two scans within a minute first saying address illegible and 1min later scheduled for next week.(about 11 days delay since half of the item was delivered)
Customer service and agent working on case was awesome. But delivery depot need better training/understanding.
Thanks"
Purolator Sucks. Its parent company has delivered the item I bought from Toronto Ontario to Calgary Alberta this month within 2 days while Purolator on the other hand delays it and makes excuses due to pandemic while Canada Post didn't and delivered it on time. My package was originally intended to be delivered on August 6 2020 but delayed to Monday. Worst thing about it is Purolator doesn't deliver on weekends to compensate and has awful and pain in the ass customer service chat.
"One of the worst shipping company out there. I don't understand why the shoe company chooses to do business with purolator.

Either purolator says the item was delivered
while it wasn't, or they delivered it to the wrong address.

The sender selects the courier not me unfortunately. This time they didn't try to knock on our door just took package to a distribution centre. The previous time they took the package to my neighbour fortunately I saw the deed and retrieved the package. Don't use them if given a chance.
They fail hard. Terrible company. Run away. Any other delivery option is better.

"I had an Amazon package that I tried to cancel but couldn't as it had already been processed. I called Purolator, whose customer rep told me after the package is dropped off, I had 24 hours to decline delivery by calling them and having the driver come pick it up to send it back to Amazon. (My building has a concierge who receives packages so I don't know it has arrived until after the driver has left).
I called Purolater when the package arrived and the driver came back to pick it up. Next day, the idiot redelivered the package back to me. I called Purolater again (and they have a hold time of about 45 minutes for every call, and their stupid website doesn't let you do any of this online) and told the person I talked to what had happened. He blamed me. He said I shouldn't have sent it back through Purolator but should have done a return through Amazon instead. I told him that I had done what Purolater had told me to do. He said it's very hard for the driver to know what packages were being sent back and what packages were being delivered and it wasn't his fault. Huh? If the driver is too stupid to keep the packages he's delivering straight, he shouldn't be a driver for a delivery company?

I have another package that I'm currently waiting for that has been in their Etobicoke facility for over a week (I live in the downtown core). It keeps repeatedly arriving at their sort facility. I could have gone and picked it up sooner.

These people are so mindbogglingly incompetent."

"Terrible service!

Just because my package was heavy, the driver didn’t even try to lift it (60 lbs). Instead this person chose to write on the notice that my appartement number didn’t exist... like seriously. Now I must go out of my way to do their job. Completely lack of professionalism. He or she should be fired."
"Tracking ID DET001431688
Twice now we have been told that a package we were to receive is undeliverable because the receiver is inaccessible. This is simply not true as both Fedex and UPS have delivered to the houses next door. We have construction on the main drive to our neighborhood but there are clearly marked detour routes in place. Today again we waited at home and no truck showed up (I have video camera's as well) and we received an email declaring it inaccessible.
Clearly the driver doesn't want to come via the detour route because of a time issue. To me the driver is lying and negligent. We will not use Purolator for anything as this has happened before. We will inform Amazon of the problem and ask they no longer use them as they are not trustworthy. I will also discourage others from using them as well."

"EDIT: I contacted their customer care via email and promptly received a response from Catherine who kindly apologized and assured that I would receive the parcel today, which I actually did. The swift rectification was enough to alleviate the frustrations from yesterday.
I'd advise reaching out to their customer support if you experience the same issue.


I am usually an understanding and patient person, more so given the current circumstances with the pandemic. However, I have not received this level of negligent service from any other courier that I have used during this pandemic. I spent the entire day at home patiently waiting for my package since its tracking status indicated it was ""On Vehicle For Delivery"" but after wasting my whole damn day, I get an update saying ""Shipment Delayed Due to Pandemic Disruptions."" Did the mailman suddenly contract the virus mid-shift?? Did the truck get contaminated?? They are using the pandemic to veil their incompetence as a business. Now, I am left with no new estimated delivery date and who knows if they'll even abide by the new one they'll provide."

"Every time, every time Amazon sends something via Purolator I know I’m going to receive Amazon’s email “Sorry, we missed you!” and have to drive to Purolator to pick it up, and I am always home. Horrible company. I’ve called to make a complaint, but their costumer service is a joke. Amazon guys and even Canada Post care to give you a call before leaving, but Purulator will say to you “their drivers aren’t allowed to call you”. Yes, I have a call box in front of my building with my name, but they “don’t have time”. Seriously, it would be faster to look it up than right the missed delivery note. By myself, I would never do business with them."

"Non existent service on 2 different shipments from Amazon. Both shipments say in the tracking that the package arrived at their sort center in Montreal, but that is it has been sitting there for a few days with no action. Tried to call Purolator but they put you on hold playing music and that's it - worst delivery service in Canada. I usually get my packages by Intelcom which give a 5 star service, but Purolator should stop their delivery service because they just don't deliver! Disgusted!"

"I ordered something online and found out later that it was going to be delivered by purolator. I immediately thought, OH. GOD. NO. The last time Purolator was supposed to deliver a package to my home I literally watched the guy run out of his truck with a slip, put it on my door without ringing the bell and then he proceeded to dart back to his truck. I whipped open the door and called out to him and you could tell he was caught off guard and then I waited until he got my package for me. The second time they did the same thing but I didn’t catch it in time.. had to drive 30 min to pick up my package at the centre. This time, I kept an eye on the tracking and when it said that it was out for delivery you better bet that I was ready to wait for the guy and bust open my door before he could take off (side note: I think it’s pretty messed up that I have to linger by my front window like a hungry animal waiting to strike in order to ensure that I get my package). Sure enough, when nothing shows up, I see that the estimated date has been pushed to 4 days from now. If it was any other delivery company I’d say ya okay they are doing their best with corona and the weekend ahead and then I’d happily wait but because it’s purolator.. it’s just soooooo typical like there is no effort at all. If the guy shows up Tuesday I will be surprised.. and let me tell you, I will be waiting to kick open my door like a freaking ninja when I see that truck pull up. No ones gonna sneak a slip on my door on my watch."

"A terrible service

I tend to buy things off amazon more then ever now with the current global crisis going on, so I usually dish out a few extra dollars to get priority mail with whatever I buy. Whenever I order something that’s shipped by Canada Post it’s always delivered before the estimated date, but for whatever reason purolator is always days late on deliveries which makes priority shipping a huge waste of money. I’m amazed this company is still in business with its terrible delivery time."
"Hello,

Due to high volumes during this time we are experiencing delays. Purolator has suspended all guaranteed shipping until further notice. Here is a link in regards to guarantee shipping services being suspended, Amazon is aware of these changes as well, https://www.purolator.com/en/service-alerts-updates/articles/service-alert-changes-service-response-covid-19

"Driver abuse 31 July 2020

I was at a Honda dealership in Ottawa today waiting outside to pickup a part in the designated area. A Purolaror truck arrived and backed into my area. The driver got out of the truck, went behind it and removed two orange security cones and then proceeded to back up right next to where I was standing. The driver started to move a box and then turned to stare at me. He just stared without saying a word, so I asked him if he saw me. I was then greeted with verbal abuse and nasty hand gesturing. I wasn't expecting that, and nobody deserves to receive abuse like this. I received my part and was about to leave when this driver continued to verbally abuse me and make more rude gestures. I took a picture of him and the license plate, at which point he aggressively approached my at my vehicle trying to take a picture of my license. He had a mask underneath his chin, so not covering his mouth or nose and he was barely 3 feet from my face. His actions are NOT acceptable and he needs an attitude adjustment. Maybe needs to find a new job. Such a hateful person and he should be fired! I have two pictures if Purolator wants to see them."
"Hello Steve,

"My shipment got lost. I called purolator at 12:13PM. The phone call lasted 33:29 and the majority of time I was on hold. JUST LIKE THE WARNING AND APOLOGY AT THE BEGINNING OF MESSAGE FOR THE ANTICIPATED DELAY DUE TO NEW SAFETY STANDARDS TRYING TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES SAFE AND HANDLING THE INCREASED CAPACITY SO MY ENTITLED ASS CAN GET MY STUFF.
I find the companies need to be cognizant of their employees safety so they can return home to their families somewhat inconvenient, but I guess they have a right to go home and enjoy their families and stuff too.
I joked about the delay when the girl first answered and she chuckled and sincerely apologized for the wait and I advised her I was prepared for the wait (AS they had told me this at the beginning of the call) and was enjoying a beverage outside and enjoying the beautiful day and advised that I may be changing to a big boy drink soon. She was a sweet and kind person and I enjoyed chatting with her and she suggested a few solutions. There was an urgency to receive the package, as the company that makes my stuff also has concerns about their employees lives and was a little backed up too. What audacity these companies have expecting me to be rational and allow extra time to get my STUFF so they can avert the possible death of one of their employees. The girl cautioned that it could take up to 48 hours to get my STUFF, due to procedural issues of handling peoples STUFF that may be contaminated with a lethal pathogen. I was going to advise her that I am a very important person and want my STUFF when I want my STUFF, but she was very sweet and I could not find it in my stone heart to assert my demands as an entitled person.
At 1:04 I received an email notice that they were beginning to try to find a rather large truck where they suspect my STUFF might be. I noted from the email that they were located in New Brunswick and replied that was likely why they were so Kind. The Maritimes and Newfoundland have the Kindest and most generous people on the planet. They have way less STUFF than us important people but they will give you what they have if you need it more than they do. BTW Great place to visit.
At 1:58pm My important STUFF was delivered.
I had not slept well the last 2 days waiting for my STUFF and now my STUFF was inferior to the STUFF they had shipped before, but it was still better than everyone else's STUFF so I guess i will need set them straight because I deserve the BEST STUFF. If I have time I will write a scathing review of their company too. However finally having my STUFF made for a good nights sleep so thank you Purolator for the good night sleep.
Not sure if me being kind to kind people precipitated the express delivery but I think I read somewhere about treating others the way you would like to be treated and it had some type of benefit so i thought I might just try it. Now as a systems engineer I can tell you that the logistics of locating a parcel from a few thousand kilometres away in such a prompt and reliable way is pretty much top of the heap. For those of you that can not comprehend remember how frustrating it was when you lost your keys. Now think how hard it would be if those keys were lost amongst a million similar keys and you had to read a 10 digit code on each one to find your keys. Now I have heard rumours of a virus that may be inserting a new feedback path to an already complex and sophisticated system and this may at times make the system meta-stable. (That means you are trying to find your keys in the pile of keys with your hands tied behind you back, while important people are kicking you in the A$$.)
In closing I am eagerly awaiting Purolator to lose my STUFF again so I can have another enjoyable experience dealing with Purolator customer service.
Hopefully they will take longer next time so I can enjoy my pleasant experience a bit longer. Hopefully I will not need to go to work later that day so I can kick back and enjoy a few big boy drinks in the outdoors of the beautiful country that I am entitled to live in because I AM CANADIAN (tm) not because I AM ME.
Be kind people. The only STUFF we really own is who we are so own Kindness and Love.

"They are the most HORRIBLE courier service, EVER. They never attempt delivery but claim to do so, they return important packages without leaving a note or calling as last attempt. They take no accountability whatsoever. Within the last 6 months, over 4 packages have been returned without a single attempt to deliver. i wish there were negative stars to give them with this review cause they are not even worth one.

"I order off of amazon a lot, but I had never had this happen to me with other packaging services. Waited at home for my package to arrive. No one called my phone or rang the buzzer, and then I get an email saying that they were not able to access my building. I called right away, and they told me they ""did not have my buzzer number on file"" and that ""calling customer phone numbers is against standards"". I double checked my address on amazon, and my buzzer number was clearly listed. They proceeded to update the address and added the buzzer info, and told me to expect my package the next day. But some time after, I got another notification asking for an updated address, so I called them a second time just to double check the address and confirm.
Next day arrives and I get yet another notification that it was not delivered and that I still need to update my address information. So I called for the third time and they said that it takes 48 HOURS for an address update request to go through... even though they already went to my building, have my updated address and told me to expect my package right away? Usually I am not one to complain, but when a package is promised to arrive TWICE and it still has not arrived, there is something really wrong about this all."

"Won't explain further but this is one of the shi**iest company around. From lying delivery personnels to useless tracking team. Modern thievery at its finest.Train your people how to use doorbell. Common sense is not so common. If Canada post, Amazon, Fedex and UPS can, why cant PuroLATER or PuroNEVER use the doorbell? During these hard times, the lease you can do is deliver the package in the most sensible way. Do it right the first time. If others can, why cant you? We need our packages and not your promises. Your company is a big joke. Modern pirates of our age. THIS IS WHAT IM GOING TO DO STARTING NOW, I AM NOT GOING TO DO ANY BUSINESS IF IT IS RELATED TO PURONEVER. I WILL ASK THE SELLER FIRST ON WHAT COURIER THEY WILL USE. IF IT IS PUROLATER THEN MIGHT AS WELL NOT BUY FROM THEM. You sellers should be also held responsible in choosing the courier services. We dont care if it is free shipping! What is free shipping if you will not receive your package?"
Amazon doesn't have a backlog. FedEx doesn't have a backlog and sometimes even delivers early. But Purolator and UPS keep screwing customers over and blaming pandemic. Leadership at the later two needs to look in the mirror. And companies need to stop using them until they improve. I had one company have to refund 400$ on a product that was 2 weeks late and damaged. Basically because they cheaped out on shipping. It's not worth it.

"Don't ask me to contact you Purolator. I won't. Ordered a new phone because due to COVID all the stores are closed or very limited hours. Phone had a promo of a free TV with it (cool) but needed the IMEI from the phone to get it no later than the 30th. So somewhat time sensitive. Delivery expected on the 27th of July... Purolator comes writes ""can't deliver to PO box"" on parcel even though address written in full on it. Sends it back to depot. Oh to add insult i work 3 minutes away but they wont deliver to my work because the contract states it has to go to my address. Call customer service on hold for 42 minutes! Ask for explanation they send for re delivery on 28th of July. They come and this time write ""cust not available..."" baloney someone was home all day. Sent to depot (an hour away) to hold for pickup. Call customer service on hold for 38 minutes! Finally get someone told them to cancel it and return it to sender. I don't need a new phone that badly and so much for the free TV. Not worth my time anymore. Every time I hear an order is coming by any courrier company i die a little inside. It's always the same BS."
"I ordered a piece of furniture from best buy, it was suppose to be delivered July 21, 2020. It comes in 2 packages, I got one of them. when I asked the driver where is the second parcel, he said I don't know maybe it will be delivered tomorrow. he shrugged his shoulders, like not my problem. When you have a Tracking number and it say's it's suppose to be delivered July 21, 2020. How does it make sense to make two stops, how is that environmental responsibility ?
Now the parcel that was suppose to be delivered yesterday has no delivery date. Thanks Purolator.UPDATE July 24, 2020 the larger parcel of two went all the way to Toronto Ontario Canada. No ETA Best Buy says probably July 29th. So the parcel was picked up in Delta BC went to the Vancouver BC sorting facility then went all the way to Toronto Ont sorting facility, has to come back to BC. Makes perfect sense. Purolator Thanks."

"My box was sent to the wrong pickup location and God they have the worse customer service. She made me repeat the service number like 10 times. Then she said it will be delivered again, I asked her if they can send it to the closest pickup location if I m not home and she said it will depend on the driver and I can always call back to have it sent to closest pickup location. I couldn't believe it!! I'm very close to call Wayfair and ask them to take it back."

My heart sinks when they tell me my package will be delivered by Purolator!' Once again i get notified by email that there was an 'attempted delivery'! I was at home ALL day and no one bothered to knock at the door or ring the bell! Are these guys Ninja's ? So once again i have to go to office on the other side of town to pick up my parcel that was supposed to be delivered to my house ! I have had no problems with other couriers including Canada Post !'Purolator sucks ! And thats the polite version!

"Worst experience ever in my life. I asked for redeliver twice as I am visiting my uncle's house and cannot pick it up at the store since the address on my driver license does not match. First time I requested online, second time by phone. Both times went well and smoothly. The lady I talked with was nice and patient, she helped me leave a note.
But redeliver never happened, not even once. It showed online ""Redelivery has been arranged"" but simply no one care.
I called this morning between 9:45-10:00 AM on 2020/07/27. The reception was extremely rude and unprofessional. She wont let me finish my EVERY sentence, yelled at me saying Purolator is not paid for second deliver. I asked for complain, she refused to do so, until I said I want to talk with your supervisor.
More interestingly, the supervisor was nice, helped me with redeliver; However, when I asked what is going to happen to this rudeness complain and if anyone will get back to me, she said she will listen to the record and forward to her manager, but typically no one will get back to either her nor me.
I also include this as reference, I am a Chinese-Canadian, and I have Chinese accent. I do not know if this is the case.
For Purolator, if you do not provide redeliver, simply do not provide this option both online chat and by phone call.
For Purolator customer service department, I assume this is a professional company with rules and regulations."

"Order was placed one month ago. They lost my package. I requested return to sender, and somehow they found the package and processed that, but it still hasn't returned to Best Buy. Best Buy won't refund my money until the package arrives.
Someone at Purolator stole my package, I guarantee it.

Based on their overwhelmingly low reviews, do I smell a class action lawsuit?

REPLY TO PUROLATOR
I've emailed my tracking number. I've called your offices. I see you're posting here to make it look like you ""care"" or that you're a real company, but let's be honest: Purolator is overdue for either a major rejuvenation or a sudden closure. Judging by the other reviews I've seen and heard, your company will be closed in the coming years because your logistics are virtually nonexistent. Do better."

Worst shipping company ever. They are using the pandemic to cover their incompetence. They have changed the delivery date multiple times. Packages that were due move one day then delayed by 4 days. Just got a new “ your package has been delayed for another 4. When I went to my local Purolator office I was told they forgot to load the package. I wouldn’t mind if it was just this shipment but this seems to be their “new normal”. Purolator is owned by a Canada Post which isn’t much better when it comes to package delivery. I have received many notices from Canada post saying” my package has been delayed due to customer updating address”. I have lived in the same house for many years. It just their way of saying we messed up but we are going to blame it on you the customer.
"Hi David,

"After few days of my order in Mark's online store, i got voice message from Purolator that i have to collect the parcel from Purolator branch at 3104 97st NW. As i entered there, an employee responded me rudely (Date: 2020 July 24th, Time 14:30 ) with anger. As I provided him the tracking number, he tried to get me away from there as much as possible without my parcel, telling again and again it has been returned to seller and he does not have there. He went unwillingly inside and brought my parcel. Still he was showing rude behavior instead of apologizing. He was treating me as if i came there without reason.
His behavior is totally unacceptable and unprofessional. I felt very bad. I had worst experience there comparing to any other companies. I appreciate Canada post employees rather, they are very professional."

"I would give Purolator a 0 star but that's not possible. How can you be so bad at your business?. I ordered a lawnmower from Costco almost 5 weeks ago and it is supposed to be delivered by Purolator. I have been calling and each time it takes almost 1 hour before my call gets picked up by an agent and they tell me same thing, they are working on it. It's been 5 weeks and I don't even have an estimated delivery date. I posted on face book and the agent says they don't know when they will be able to give me news on my item and its delivery. This is so unprofessional and frustrating. Please don't use them for deliveries. They don't do a good job."

"Item was marked as delivered, but never actually arrived. I was home all day working by my window and no Purolator trucks passed by. Absolutely no proof of delivery aside from the driver's word. Called their support line and was met with a snarky agent that said they would investigate it, giving absolutely no time frames. After that, nothing but template emails. My item is as good as gone now. I've had no issues with any other delivery company, even during COVID. Only Purolator gets their core business so horribly wrong.

Purolator is a stain on e-commerce. I'll always have to think twice when shopping online now, as the convenience of ordering online is diminished if I have to end up dealing with Purolator. If you're a business, avoid Purolator. If you're an individual, avoid Purolator. If you need to get a parcel from point a to point b, avoid Purolator. Avoid Purolator by any means necessary."

Ordered from amazon. and they usually use their own courier or UPS and never once I ever get an address issue. but when amazon decided to use Purolator I get address issues using the same address that I never once got that problem within other careers.
"The Canada Post which is known as email mail is becoming fast to get our items. Guaranteed my add. I was told when I purchased my item I should receive a today. Purolator informs me today after sitting on hold for 2 hours that it could take up to a week. My item is sitting in there warehouse which I know I didn't consent to nor did the shipper. Thia is not the first time. Civil law suite is what is going to end up happening if they don't get there crap together. Oh, and to top everything off, my item had to pass me twice to go between warehouse which was very unnecessary."

I noticed many bad reviews but my experience was great. There was trouble with accessing my building on delivery day, i received a call and got it sorted out and is now on its way! I spoke with a girl named Krista on the phone and she was unbelievably nice, patient and thorough with information and got everything fixed up."
"Where to begin? The shipment that couldn't be delivered in time even though the address was correct and was updated correctly? The time that they rang a broken doorbell even though there was a sign asking them to knock and didn't deliver the package because no one answered? Or this wonderful experience I'm currently stuck in because I was left a notice indicating that my shipment would be available for pickup since I wasn't home when delivery was attempted, only to be given the wrong phone number for the pick up location, and then receive an email saying it's out for delivery. I have been stuck at home waiting ALL DAY for this delivery and I can't find out where the hell my package is because no one is there and no one answers the phone at the location my package was supposed to be waiting.

Amazon package was over a week late. Finally delivered to the wrong address - did not even call to check.

Strongly suggest Amazon and other businesses avoid at all costs. Really incompetent company.

"Again, Purolator fails. When one orders (amazon) shipping dates are committed to. Those dates come form data provided by Purolator no doubt. But with Covid, it is the go to excuse...package on truck for delivery...nothing...then delayed due to covid...Amazon should take their business elsewhere or why bother ordering or put a free shipping for when we get around to it."
"Had a package shipped on July 15 from Markham Ontario to Welland Ontario
Arrived at Niagara on the lake July 17 but said incorrect address. Talked to an agent Friday July 17 she said could not deliver until Tuesday July 21. The notice in tracking still says incorrect address
Even though Purolator has my phone number no one calls to confirm address. The packing slip shows my correct address.
Very poor customer service I would pay more and use another courier in the future Purolator has no customer service period.
I was waiting for samples to make a sale still waiting a week later"
"I have to admit, this Carrier is suck!
Why?
Because I just received slips every time, when I order from Amazon, I wrote down the instruction very detail and asking them to call the Manager's phone number to open the main door (because my apartment doesn't have the doorbell and the communication system not working) but they never did!

And they even dropoff my package in front of the main door (not even in the building), so it is very easy to be stolen because it is located on the main road, no announcements, no phone call, no nothing."
Bought an ac online with canadian tire. Site mentions that I will be contacted to set up delivery. Today Purolator decided without contacting me they will deliver tomorrow while I'm at work. They will not let me change the delivery date or adress and confirmed that they will just leave it on my very visible doorstep for anyone to take. Now I have to take a day off work to make sure it doesnt get stolen. Very unhappy.

"How long do I wait? Like forever?
July 8. Canadian Tire is ten minutes from my home. I purchase a bicycle trailer to transport my new folding Uro kayak and enjoy my summer on Lake Ontario.
July 10. A text notice of delivery. Nothing. ?
July 13. Phone calls to Canadian Tire. Emails to Purolator. Nothing. ? A ""template"" response from Robot Vincent. ?
Days go by....An email from Ali Alsomali in New Brunswick. He is tracing my package at the Pickering Depot. ? He's sorry, but would like me to describe the package. Size. Weight, Design. ?
Later. I call Canadian Tire and Shawn says, ""That's really weird."" He says ""Canadian Tire will replace the product if Purolator officially lost it.""
My stress level goes down one degree.
Soooooooo. Question for Robot Vincent. It's now July 20. It's been 11 days for a shipment from a store that is 10 minutes away.

"Sub-par logistics, abysmal service, false claims of ""attempted deliveries,"" lost and damaged parcels, returns to seller without contacting buyer or seller based on false claims of attempted deliveries, packages remain at their centre, they don't even bother using their own designated drop-points closest to buyer's address, they no longer even deliver printed notifications on-site, simply claim attempted delivery and generate notifications online, coupled with automated robo-calls.

Purolator has even been caught several times claiming ""attempted delivery / can't find address / undeliverable"" while showing ""attempted delivery"" not only to wrong address, but entirely wrong part of the city! Not coincidentally, the wrong part of the city happens to be the location of their centre in Toronto: North York.

Well, Purolator flunkies are not likely to find Toronto *East* or *West* or Beaches in *North* York, are they?

I sincerely submit the following new motto for Purolator:

""Purolator: Count on us to deliver notifications and false claims to you clients, not packages!"""
They really are the bottom of the barrel for trusted deliveries. Have had multiple packages with expensive items thrown on my door or porch with no concern of the giant fragile sticker on the box.. Have had multiple missed delivery dates. Only thing you can count on them to do is mess stuff up. Only service worse then them is Canada post.
WORST PARCEL DELIVERY COMPANY EVER... I ordered something 15 mins from my house because the place is closed for walk ins only delivery. Well they chose Purolator to ship my items.

Tells me that he is going to send it to there tracking team gives me a case number and they will email me in 2 to 3 hours. Now about 6 hours later and nothing.

"Terrible. They attempted a delivery while my buzzer wasn't working. I heard the driver outside my building and ran out but he left immediately. EVERY other courier service would call, and I've had at least 15 other packages delivered while my buzzer wasn't working. But okay fine.

Then I keep checking the tracking # to see when I can go pick it up or something. A day later the website still hasn't updated and I see the Purolator guy leaving my building for someone else, so I contact them.

"Absolutely terrible, can’t give a damn type service at Purolator. Ordered a package last week on Amazon with 2 day delivery. 2 days later it said “Out for delivery” along with another package I was expecting from Purolator. One package arrived and the other did not. Message said courier is unable to gain access to front door. When I called Purolator, after waiting about 55 minutes to speak to a CSR, I was told that Purolator requires a buzzer code (I live in a condo with 2 concierge always on duty during day) for all deliveries. I advised the CSR that this is not accurate because I have received dozens and dozens of packages over the course of the 4 years I have lived here. Never a single buzzer code was provided or used by a delivery person. And how on earth was a package successfully delivered 30 mins earlier?? No answer other than to keep parroting their outdated policy. I asked why didn’t the driver call me. “We don’t issue our drivers company cell phones” So instead I guess they make their drivers lug the package back to a warehouse and have it reshelved pending me having to call them and wait on hold for an hour.
Then the CSR says she will update my account to say it’s okay to leave packages with concierge. Excuse me??? It’s always been that way and now during Covid, even more so. There are large clearly written signs at the entrance to my condo saying that no delivery people are allowed beyond the main entrance and to leave the packages on the supplied tables for the concierge to retrieve upon the delivery person departing the entranceway.
This all occurred last Friday so I mistakenly figured it would go out for delivery again on Monday...WRONG again! CSR advises that the message she uploads to system saying that it’s okay to leave with concierge will not be seen by the warehouse until Monday evening so I may get it Tuesday or Wednesday but even then, they cannot guarantee it will be delivered. You would think they would have a quicker computer system to be able to get that package out of their warehouse (taking up space) and to the customer.
Monday morning comes and I’m not expecting the package but I check the tracking for it and it now says “Incorrect Address” I call Purolator, wait another hour to speak to a CSR and he assures me it’s just an automated message and he sees I called in previously and that it will be on the truck tomorrow (Tuesday). I wake up Tuesday to see a new entry that day that says “Incorrect Address” again. I call back Purolator (wait the standard hour again) and ask why they can’t put it on the truck that comes to my condo everyday with other Purolator packages I have received since this debacle has occurred.
She starts to parrot their contradictory policy and clearly has no intention of helping me. I ask if I can just go to the warehouse and pick it up the next day (thought giving them 24 hrs would be a good solution). WRONG again!!! “Sorry sir. If I put in that request to the system, it may take 48-72 hours to update and we can’t guarantee when the package would be available for you to pick up.” Unbelievable!!! I offer to do their job for them by going to pick it up from the warehouse or from a nearby pickup centre and they still can’t make that happen in under 3 days.
It’s now Wednesday and yet another message uploaded to their tracker saying “Incorrect Address”. Now I think they are just screwing with me. But even if they aren’t, they obviously must have the most outdated computer system I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing.
I’m all for solutions and not just complaining. Simple, old fashioned solution which Purolator refuses to grasp or implement. Pick up the phone call over to the warehouse and ask that package #123 be put on the truck tomorrow. “Sorry, can’t do that. Can only put a message in the computer thingy ma-jig and then it may or may not be seen by the warehouse this week and then we may or may not get it out to you this week.” Blah, blah, blah.
I’ve already called Amazon to ask if I can make sure Purolator never delivers my packages. Unfortunately they can’t, but they did advise that Purolator can be placed on a “De-prioritzed” list which means they will be the last option for delivery of any of my parcels.
Anything to try and ensure Purolator and their archaic business system are relegated to the heap of failed businesses.

Update: Thursday morning, still says “Incorrect Address”. Figured I’d call in while I have my morning coffee and receive my excuse of the day. Was only on hold for 10 minutes and then the CSR that answered reviewed my file and immediately said “This shouldn’t be taking this long. I’m going to look into this right now”. Finally! Someone that knows how to do their job, takes pride in their job, and actually seems to care about the service they provide. Vickie from the Moncton call centre was phenomenal to deal with!!"

Waiting for parts. Called Purolator 1800 waited 48 minutes on the phone. Package in Corner Brook warehouse depot since Juky 8th. Could not contact the depor in Corner Brook. Customers not happy waiting for parts. The driver arrives the day after I talked to a service rep. He says the truck was down. Oh really for a week. Kept making excuses. Worst service ever.

"What started as an attempted to delivery to an incorrect address (which was my fault for not realizing I can't send Amazon packages to a P.O.) was followed another attempted delivery to the same wrong address days after I called in to correct the address, and then another attempted delivery to my house without leaving a delivery notice. After reading many terrible reviews and similar stories, I'm starting to doubt that they even tried to deliver."
"0 star if I could pick it. I was at home yet I got a delivery notice. I have been receiving tons of packages everyday and never a problem with my door bell. This damn courier has a shipping center 10km away and when I got there 3 hours after the time it said the package would be available, I was told the package had not been scanned in and I would need to come back the next day. Worst of all, the staff there just gave me the ""I don't give a f@ck"" attitude. If I had a choice, I would NEVER use them to send anything. Should be shut down."

"Most of the agents are super rude and none of them are professional - I guess they just hired random people without any training. Yes people tend to leave negative reviews on Trustpilot but trust me, Purolator is a company sucks than everyone else.
1) You'll need to wait 10 minutes for a live agent to answer each of your question.
2) The call centre can never be reached out: the estimated wait time is more than 10 minutes means at least 40 minutes (I tried twice and gave up);
3) They are super rude and impatient, not helpful at all and they end up the chat without asking even though you have more to ask

I suggest to go to their Twitter account and dm for help. This was the only way I tried and got an answer that helps."

"Never trust puralator!! Our massive package was supposed to arrive on 3rd July 2020. Puralator tried delivering it first time, the driver didn't leave any note and returned with the package. We rescheduled the delivery 2 times, same thing happened. The driver didn't leave a note, neither did the company put enough efforts to call us and let us know about the delivery attempts. The customer service is the worst we've ever experienced. At this point we are pretty much convinced that the drivers lie about attempting the delivery. This is ridiculous!!"

"Requested a bank draft for new car from Tangerine and it was shipped registered mail by Purolator. Was shipped in timely manner but Purolator gave it to a third party and did not train that person. Tracking said it was delivered to my door at 5:42pm....NOT!! Driver did throw it on my porch 20 minutes later without any contact with me so no signature of any kind. If someone had stolen that package from my porch, I was screwed because Purolator was not accepting any responsibility. I called Purolator and customer service rep was flabbergasted and said I will receive a follow up from depot manager within 72 hours...did not happen. I called back in 90 hours and case was escalated and I was promised a call. It is now one week later the call has not happened. If I could give -2 stars, I would do it. I will never use Purolator but if the company that is selling me a product chooses them, there is not much I can do.

UPDATE
Well...now 5 weeks after the ""incident"" and I am not getting any response from the person that was supposed to contact me within 72 hours. Spoke to a Donna that promised a call by July 22 - she gave me her extension number but when I called July 22 and July 29, she was not ""available"". Even Catherine from Customer Care has emailed me but still waiting for a reply from her - what's happening Catherine??? Just got off the phone with a person called Elizabeth and while she was initially pleasant, there was a crude remark during that call (guess it is not recorded) and I'm sure she will not be helpful at all.
Purolator - you are going to have to clean up your act or your business is in serious trouble (if it isn't already). I WILL NEVER EVER USE YOUR SERVICES AGAIN and will purchase from ""brick & mortar"" in person so I can avoid courier incompetence!!"

"I know delivery companies in general are pretty flawed, especially at such a weird time like a global pandemic.

But gosh....why does Purolator have to suck so much?

I waited all day for a package that never came. Messaged Purolator and they told me they couldn't deliver it today because they were busy, but maybe they'd try tomorrow (I'm not sure why they couldn't update the tracking page to reflect that).

Well their next day delivery attempt was a 7:20am...maybe drive by? I don't know, I was awake and no one ever came to the door. No delivery attempt slip left, either. Just a tracking page that says I'm now SOL. I have no way to get to the depot.

Imagine if Purolator, a company that's supposed to deliver packages, actually delivered packages."

"June 26 dyson sent me a package. June 29 they tried to deliver it to my neighbour's who works nights and sleeps in the day. I called and got put on hold for 35 min. Finally arranged another delivery after telling them they went to the wrong house. Next delivery, same thing, neighbor brought another sorry we missed you notice. I called again, more wait time, hung up after 35 min. Called again, this time only waited45 min, and explained the whole sordid situation. She wrote a note for the driver saying the house had a big white porch out front and the biggest maple tree on the street. I waited on my front lawn and ended up having to flag down the driver. I told him how long I had been waiting for this delivery and he said was this from dyson? I told him yes. He said someone had scratched out my house number and put my neighbours in place. The young man was very polite and said he would make sure to get it here tomorrow. He did! I want you to show appreciation to the young driver on route 2041 in fort erie, july9. He went above and beyond. He should be commended and put in charge of training the others as to what customer service is all about. It was obviously not purolater training. Great job young man, we need more of you!"
"Worst possible mailing system. I am completely sure that the delivery guy was too tired to buzz our door just posted that the receiver was not available. Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, service.

If I could rate a 0 I would. I ordered a present through amazon for my daughter. They left the Bright teal pink box in the middle of my porch Where you can clearly see from the road. Upon picking up the package it was busted open in numerous spots. This led me to open the package. The $200 toy was scratched and dented from the rough handling endured and the door had a crack. I called amazon and they were amazing providing me with a replacement well today once again my replacement came and the box is destroyed again with one end being completely opened up. This is absolutely ridiculous I will be notifying Amazon and stating that I want Purolator delivery banned from my account as when I receive their products from other couriers I have never had an issue. Unacceptable. It clearly shows that the object inside is a plastic camper van and that it is in original packaging with clearly no protection. Don’t toss the thing around!!! You would figure that would be common sense... and needless to say my daughter also knows what she is getting due to it left in the middle of the porch this is the least of our worries with the condition this delivers in....

The worst courier I ever been. I checked on my package status and surprisingly it showed that my package had been delivered in my front door. I lived in an apartment building. They just left my parcel in the hallway. I went to their shipping centre and they just told me it was already delivered and cannot do anything about it because the sender didn't ask for a signature.

"Absolute the worst courier in the world. Every time a company ships through Puroloser I have late shipments that never get delivered. I need to spend hours on the phone trying to find out what happened to my shipment.

Since I live on the outskirts of town I am beyond their delivery limits yet Fedex and UPS have no problem. I need to write a permanent disclaimer to Amazon to never use Puroloser to ship to me.

Now I am trying to track down a package that is labelled as delivered but I never received it. The call center hung up on me twice, and now I'm on hold for god knows how long since all their other customers are probably on the phone trying to find their packages.
Puroloser should just do everyone a favor and close their doors permanently."

"Absolute Garbage.

They never called as instructed, or even the infamous slip, just got a notification on amazon that they could not ring the buzzer.

Been on hold for over an hour for an expected 10-minute wait.

Legitimately the worst delivery service in Canada, give me the small-time local companies EVERY TIME.

No Delivery, No call, no-slip, unable to follow directions. No customer service. If I could hard ban them from every delivery I would.

GREAT NEWS!!! They are no longer a carrier for me on Amazon! This is the best thing ever to happen <3 no longer to I have to fear this toxic company.

I recommend all people contact amazon support and do this."

"I was expecting to receive a package from Purolator this morning. I was at home and the driver didn't bother to knock at the door not ring the door bell. He left delivery attempted notice on my door and I see package will be ready for pickup on 07/09 at nearby Purolator location to my house. Upon seeing this notice, I tried to contact chat representative and discussed about this issue and she said unfortunately she cannot help other than putting complain against the driver. I asked to at least make it available for pickup today to nearby Purolator location but she could not help. This is frustrating and pathetic service from Purolator. I lost my entire day without the package and it was very urgent for me to receive the package. Better to shut down such companies if they cannot provide good service. Nasty."

"So ordered an air conditioner, on their web site it states in Transit for the last few days,the depot is very close by I have been waiting a week now, phoned 2 days ago being told it has to scan and then sent out but today I called waited half an hour to speak to someone now they have a tracing specialist assigned to my case BUT it will take 30 hours before they contact me back. I was also told that it should have been delivered by now and yet the tracking information states IN TRANSIT. The website tracking is never updated as it should be even with COVID-19, so I understand the retail industry should start doing their own deliveries this is madness. Amazon seems to be the only service that delivers on time."

I must have just missed him while I was throwing out the trash. He didn’t bother to call me on my cell. He left a note that stated I should pick up the package the following day....in LANGLEY. 20km (!) away from my house. A full 1 hr away by bus. That’s Absolutely ridiculous!!! What kind of amateur service are they running. I will have to spend half my day tracking my package down. I contacted their customer service line and I was told the next quickest delivery be on Friday July 10th!!!! I’ve never heard of such awful service. Even during this COVID period. They are by far the worst delivery service in the country. Complete amateurs."

"Bad customer service. Typically, with other shipping companies, they don't even try to deliver the package to my door. Knowing this, I thought they'd just leave a slip in the lobby with my name and information about where I could pick it up. I was wrong. Seeing the first ""Address incomplete"" notice two weeks ago, I had to contact Purolator myself, and found that I needed to contact the shipper to contact them to add my unit number (Seriously? what?) . So I did, but nobody has updated it on their end. I've contacted customer service again, 7 days out from the original shipment date, who said ""you might as well order another one"".

We're now sitting at 2 weeks, 1 day. The address still says ""incomplete"", they've tried to deliver it 5 times, every time realising the unit number isn't on the package. What's worse, they keep trying to use the pandemic as an excuse for their poor customer service and terribly organised company structure. I even asked if I could set the package to pick up, well I'd have to contact the shipper to contact them to be able to pick it up (same position). And Purolator apparently doesn't care if you're a student because your address must be on a government photo i.d to pick up your package. Nobody else does this. Canada post doesn't do this.

Horrible."

Sat around all day waiting for a package here in BC Canada.Tracking updated to state that my location is not supported.I have recieved 4 packages in the last month from the same vendor the latest only two days ago delivered to my door with Purolator shipping labels on the boxes Spent 40 minutes on the phone and now I guess waiting for the local reps to hopefully get back to me.How about not changing rules in midgame for people who just spent money and expected to get their stuff.I also live 10 miles from the nearest town and have no vehicle or else I could've just gone in and picked stuff up in person.Okay Vanessa that's great but did you see where I already contacted customer service and spent an hour on hold to get zero info and now I'm supposed to spend the next several days hovering over the phone waiting for a response.How is it that my address is viable for a month and isn't now? My house didn't crawl 5 miles up a mountain.I also spent an hour and a half on hold with the same vendor trying to put a hold on an order for some really important equipment that just blew up but I guess my my 100 lb self can lug a fifty pound water pump and a weedwacker home on a bus because you decided randomly you aren't a shipping company but some kind of warehouse.Its like paying a dentist to yank a tooth and they pull it halfway out.Maybe your CEO should only get half their salary and the rest whenever the disappointed customers decide.Truly awful and in the middle of a pandemic.How us this place still even open for business with this many lousy reviews.Update they sent the package to the local depot ten miles away from my rural home and since I don't have a vehicle I had to pay a local courier $20 to deliver it to me.He was great although having to cough up that much money from a tiny disability income SUCKED.Update July 18. Turns out the regular driver was on vacation and the new driver was unsure of my rural driveway and input the wrong info on the tracking.I have since recieved more deliveries with no issues.The drivers are excellent the customer service is non-existent.The drivers should get company cell phones and a list of that days packages customer phone numbers to call if there are any issues vs a bunch of dicking around.Call center reps should actually have access to customer info when you call them.

"Ordered a few PC components from Newegg Canada on June 25th, 2020. On June 26th, the shipment was created by Newegg.ca. The tracking number was generated on the Purolator site: BVH006381487 (Ref:490979713).

From June 26th, till today July 6th, the tracker is showing ""Shipping Label Created"". I reached out Newegg, they emailed and provided info that the shipment was picked up on July 2nd, and the estimated delivery date is July 6th. However, the Purolator tracking site still giving the same tracking update ""Shipping Label Created""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am not sure where my order is, tracking is stuck at the same status from June 26th! I searched for Purolator's service on the internet reviews, and got to know how bad the shipping service is with Purolator! In future, I will be avoiding the shipping options with Purolator, if I don't get the product today July 6th, as per the email sent by Newegg with the expected delivery date (let's forget about the tracking update, I lost my hope on that)!"

"From their website""No matter where your customers are located – From Kelowna to St. John’s or anywhere in between, Purolator delivers, so you can grow your business to every corner of Canada."" I live between Kelowna and St John's, but Purolater tells me I'm not in a delivery area. So I have to drive 20 minutes to pick up my package. But the kick in the ass is the truck will drive PAST my house to the next town, with my package. Morons. Most expensive to to not get service around They say they won't deliver to a post office, yet the post office says the ONLY courier the receive packages from is Purolator? And they are owned by Canada Post. AVOID.

2months later. I was just leaving the post office and what drives past me, a Purolator truck, making a delivery to a business in town.

I'm sorry to hear your item was damaged. Please forward us your tracking number through email at customer.care@purolator.com. We will file the complaint with the depots management. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"I've been dealing with this company for about a year and a half and I can count on one hand the positive experiences I've had with them, and I've had well over 100 deliveries to my home. You never really know when exactly you'll get your orders. They love to say that your packages are out for delivery, then say they made a ""delivery attempt"" (on an item that doesn't require signature and can be left on the doorstep), only to then reschedule it for days in advance. Sometimes they'll even send it backwards to a previous location in their system, wait a week and then send it back. It's absolutely ridiculous.
If you're buying something that ships from this company, don't expect to get your deliveries in a timely manner. For a company whose job is to literally deliver packages, they sure do have a hard time doing it.
Slow deliveries, frequent non-deliveries (which they then tell the company that the customer requested a rescheduling of the order, which is false), and then they'll hold it until they feel in the mood to deliver it.
Absolute nightmare. Avoid at all costs."
"Hello Hye,

We apologize for the negative experience you've had with your deliveries. If there is anything we can help with please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
Ive sent out my Playstation to be repair to a repair shop that is own by playstation over a month ago and it had to be shipped threw purolator because playstation sent me the packaging and everything to be sent off packaging was fine got here like normal but the minute that playstation send it back to me purolator suddenly cant find my address even though they are the ones that sent me the package to put my ps4 in to be sent out and on top of that they called me to tell me that they couldnt send it to me because my address apperently didnt show up in there system even though the addres was correct but not only that i asked them if my package was in the depot they told me yes over the phone and when i came to ask them if i could come pick it up myself they wouldnt allow me to come and get it

"I wish I had the choice to put no stars. They are a horrible mailing service, I ordered a simple package to be delivered from Calgary to airdrie and they haven't even updated my tracking info since the 29th of last month. Once I get my package you have lost my business

I got the package now but you guys need to reevaluate your customer service I'm not the only 1 star complaint"

I apologize for the delay on your shipping. We are experiencing very high volumes at this time due to the Covid-19. Please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. We can assist you with your shipments transit. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Purolator is TERRIBLE.
This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with a courier company. The virtual assistant chat is messed up and it does not work when you ask it to transfer you into a chat with a live agent, the customer service calls are horrible, most of the times they don't work and goes straight to their automatic answering machine, but when they eventually do, the call waits are over half an hour long! Is that normal? I don't think so. Even with the pandemic going on, other delivery companies are still very fast, and very efficient. How come Purolator isn't?"
"Hello Robin,

I apologize for the negative experience you've had with Purolator. Pleas reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com, we would like to try and help you with your shipment. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
You’d think after all the negative reviews Purolator will at least consider providing drivers with company cell phones to improve customer service and accommodate special requests? But I guess Purolator doesn’t care about customer satisfaction.

"Purolator has the worse service ever. I had an order with Amazon Prime to receive something for my kid. I paid for one day delivery. The purolator person came at 8:20 pm and called our buzzer just once and ran away. Our place was noisy and I noticed the ring after a few seconds. I ran to elevator to catch him but he had left quite fast. He even didn't try to dial our buzzer one more time.
I work during the week and can not go to their office during the week so I have to wait for next Saturday or I have to take a few hours off from work to go there and pick my package up from somewhere far from my home and work place.
So what's the point of Amazon Prime? Specially when you need something fast but Purolator is going to deliver it to you?
I won't forgive them."
"Hello Mina,

Our drivers ring up once and if they are not let into the building they will leave. If you need us to help arrange another delivery please forward your tracking number to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thanks, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"My package left Toronto 6 days ago, still according to tracking hasn't reached Winnipeg. One customer support person claims a breakdown of some equipment in Toronto (Than why is it shown in Transit?)
Another claims the delay is due to a backup in Winnipeg (Then why does it not show being scanned at the Winnipeg Depot) No indication of when if ever they will deliver it, they are The WORST, Incompetent courier anywhere, DO NOT choose to use these losers"

We apologize that the items scanning has not updated. Please reach out to us through email at customer.care@purolator.com for further help with your shipment. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Absolutely under no circumstances should you consider this company a trustworthy delivery service. They left our package outside our complex, didn’t call, buzz or knock. Simply left it on the street in front of a building. Management said it wasn’t their fault because that’s their contract with amazon which apparently just stipulates that they just need drop-off at an address PERIOD. They’re under no other obligation to do anything other than drop a package off and run away apparently.
All 15 packages I have received from other amazon delivery services arrived via a phone call or buzz."
"Hello Derrick,

I am sorry to hear that you had issues receiving your shipment. We should be knocking or ringing at the time of delivery to advise the delivery was made. I can forward this complaint to our depots management if you would like to send us your tracking number by email. Our email address is customer.care@purolator.com. Thanks, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"You people who work for Purolator are the most disrespectful, LOW human beings ever. How can you leave somebody's parcel not even in front of their door but right beside it in an apartment building up for grabs for anybody to steal? And not one single CURTESYYY KNOCKKK (LIKE CANADA POST DOES) to allow the person who ordered the parcels to know that you are here with their package! This is why you people who work for this company are GARBAGE HUMAN BEINGS. How would you like it if you ordered something from ONLINE, and somebody came to deliver your parcel, did not give you a courtesy knock on your door and and somebody came along and stole your parcel?! Why don't you treat other human beings how you expect to be treated you FKNG pieces of sh i ttt!! I am going to report you to the Better Business of Ontario so that you have no choice but to deliver people's packages in a respectful and Humane manner. Otherwise you all are going to get sued for people's stolen parcels! If somebody orders a small item... I don't understand why you uncompassionate and disrespectful ID**TS can't leave it in our mailboxes or drop it off at the post office so that we can safely pick it up without risking somebody else getting their hands hands on it and stealing it."

"Negligent company with incredibly low standards. Hundreds of dollars in packages missing/stolen. Appeared as ""delivered at front door"". NO text notification, NO knock on door, and when I checked camera footage there was no truck on said delivery date. When opening up an investigation with Purolator, their GPS came back ""inconclusive"". They had ""exhuasted all their efforts"" and closed the file and discontinued responding. Absolutely appalling. Because of policy, Purolator is not responsible for reimbursing, rather the company you placed your order with takes responsibility for the items. This not only encourages THEFT from all their drivers, it encourages negligence as to leaving packages out in the open because they're not going to be held liable or receive any consequences. NEVER ORDER FROM PUROLATOR, THEFT IS INEVITABLE DUE TO NEGLIGENCE AND EXPECT ZERO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
I dealt with LOUISE BOHMER through customer service and she was incompetent, short, rude, unhelpful, and discontinued replying when I continued to ask for answers."
"Hello Melissa,

We are sorry to hear the searches for your shipment came back negative. Your sender would be the one to reimburse you for the contents and shipping of the item. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"It's unfortunate that this site does not have a ""zero stars"" option, because granting this courier service even one star is excessive. I ordered a vinyl record as a gift for father's day and have had to return it twice. In both instances, the packaging was severely dented and bent - the record itself was heavily damaged and essentially garbage. I called Purolator to see if there was a way that they could ensure this type of gross product damage could be avoided on return, to which they apathetically responded that there was not (using COVID as an excuse, of course). At this point, I've decided to refund my purchase rather than gamble with another return; this company clearly prioritizes rushed delivery over quality assurance. In the future, I will be immediately cancelling any online orders being shipped via Purolator"
"Hello Cole,

I'm truly sorry to hear about the damages to your shipment. Sometimes during transit, especially when we are experiencing high volumes, shipments can be damaged. This is not something we like to see and again, I apologize. If you would like to forward us your tracking number by email at customer.care@purolator.com we can file your complaint with management. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"

"Bought an item from Epson on 17th June 2020, unfortunately they chose Purolator and I am still waiting for it after a week. Their tracking system is absolutely mediocre as there is no update for a week - it just says ""TORONTO SORT CTR/CTR TRI, ON Arrived at sort facility"". I also found out that 91% of Purolator is owned by Canada Post which could explain the dire customer service. Please do not use this company; they have a lot of learning to be done before serving customers, choose UPS instead!"
"Hello Puvi,

If there is anything we can assist you with, please let us know. Our email address is customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"

"Its been 5 days since the initial delivery date passed. Called Purolator customer service and the guy told me he doesn't know where it is. I was told it might be in Winnipeg, and it might not be. Checked the tracking info this morning and all previous information has been deleted and it says ""Delivery date information will be available once details are provided by the carrier""

It had been a couple years since I used Purolator (for good reason) and i've just been reminded why.

Please do not reply with the generic ""We apologize.. please reach out to our customer service blah blah."" This is a review, not an inquiry.

To help Purolator, my only suggestion would be to send everyone a ream of paper with Purolator letterhead for when we have to print photos of the birthday gifts our children were supposed to open on their birthdays."
"Hello Ry,

We apologize for the delays on your item. If you need any further help please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"

"Hi Bimal,

I apologize for the negative experience you've had with us. Please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com if you need any help with a shipment. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"One of the worst experiences ever. I ordered a $50 item from BestBuy.ca. It was promptly shipped out but never arrived. I have done thousands of dollars in actual shipping cost with Purolator and can only imagine someone that does very little may be treated worse. I went online and tried the virtual agent. After 20 minutes it referred me to a live agent. No live agent available please use email. I emailed along with all tracking info and order numbers etc. I filled in all the lines and answered all the questions. I received a phone call saying there would be a follow up phone call. I did. Again I had to go through every detail and was then told I would receive an email. I got the email and each time a different person and explained every detail. I was told on each occasion Purolator would check their GPS record to confirm it was delivered. No email contained previous conversations. That last email I got basically said their GPS co ordinates confirmed delivery, have a nice day. I made two requests for the GPS co-ordinates they say it was delivered to with no response. I strongly believe two weeks of frustration wasn't necessary.
This item was for my daughters birthday in May. I had no other option than to order the same item which arrived today. I paid twice and got it once. BTW, Best Buy did not reply to my request to assist me as its their choice of courier. No response from them but it was not their fault, only in choosing a terrible company to service their customers.
Ward Edmonds

I want to add that I know about 5 or 6 of Purolators drivers and they are terrific. Professional and always drop my stuff at the same door. I have security cameras and there is no picture of a truck the day they confirmed in their GPS it was delivered. Most people are not aware........Purolator Inc. is a Canadian courier that is 91% owned by Canada Post, 7% owned by Rainmaker Investments Ltd. and 2% by others.

Just read the response below. Open a claim. How about simply give me the GPS co-ordinates Purolator says they delivered it to. Over and over it's just a stall tactic until you give up."
"Hi Ward,

We apologize that your item could not be found. If the delivery was confirmed you will need to speak with your sender in regards to having them opening a claim on the item. They will be able to help you further with any refunds on the item. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Stop pretending to deliver your packages!! The first time I caught your driver trying to deliver a notice without even ringing the doorbell, and he scrambled back with his notice to grab my package and said ""Oh you were expecting the package?"" No crap I was expecting a package!!

Today, well, I guess he smartened up, because I was waiting by my door this afternoon, and again, no doorbell, but I received a notification on my phone that my package was not able to be delivered because no one was home. I quickly opened the door, and yes, a notice on my door. OMG, why do you have the most lazy drivers in the world. Now my critical package is not available until TOMORROW, and I have to pick it up myself. Thanks for potentially exposing me to COVID19 by having me go out of my way to pick up something I paid to be shipped to my house.

I have never had this experience with FedEX, UPS, Amazon, Canada Post. And looking on the internet, it does seem like a Purolator only experience.

Thanks for the terrible service."
"Hello Reb,

We apologize that our driver is not making valid delivery attempts. Please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com with your tracking number. We can arrange another delivery for you and file your complaint with our depots management. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Customer service just lied to us for no reason.

We tried several times to get a package delivered to our front door. We received a ""sorry we missed you"" notice even though we were home all day so we called to request it be re-delivered and left on our porch. The rep told us that they would attach a note to our tracking number and that would be no problem. The next day we received another note instead of our package and when we called back we were told that the reps have no authority to allow deliveries to be left at the door.

Why do we pay for shipping if we have to bus to their distribution center to pick things up anyway?"
"Hi Nathan,

I am sorry about the agent providing incorrect information. If you would like us to verify that your item can be left please forward us your tracking number by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"usually, i have no issues with purolator at all, which surprises me, reading all these reviews.

i am BEYOND disappointed with them. i upgraded my cellphone on friday, and was insanely excited to received it yesterday, as my tracking number was showing it to be ""on truck for delivery."" i waited ALL day for them to show up, and they never did. i got NO updates whatsoever, but late last night saw that it had made its way back to the depot, two hours away.

this morning i was - again - excited to see that it was on the truck for delivery as of 7:41a. imagine my unpleasant surprise when i see - at 11:04a - almost FOUR HOURS AFTER - the message saying ""delayed due to current pandemic disruption.""

instead of getting my hopes up by showing that it was on the way, why not just update tracking AS IT HAPPENS? why wait four hours before dashing my hopes?

i am beyond upset at their lack of compassion, organization and professionalism. stop lying and just tell it straight! i value honesty over lip service."
"Hello Gen,

I apologize that your item was not delivered when expected. We are experiencing higher then normal volumes at this time. If you need any further help please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
Purolator has taken #1 first place as the most abysmal transport company in my opinion. The ineffectiveness of there information system is absurd. After reading the other reviews I see the same thing time and time again with them. I receive out of order notices about my package only to tell me that my package arrived in the sorting facility around 6am. I understand it may not be on a truck that day. The following day I receive another notice that its just arrived at the sorting facility (again?). The following message is that its delayed due to covid. With the reopening of the country and so many people returning to work I can only assume that the reason they cannot fulfill there businesses primary function is that prior to covid they must have had some seriously substandard working environments that the company is scrambling to fix in light of covid while trying to get packages out. All while certain levels of the company are relaxing putting extra and undue stress on the lower tier employees. My issue is not with the employees but the company as a whole. Evidently the service will only get worse.
"Hello Johnny,

Our depots have been experiencing higher then normal volumes due to the dependency on delivery during this time, allowing people to stay home. We apologize for these delays. If you still require assistance with your shipment please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"The WORST delivery company, service, what service? After 3 days of delays and still blaming Covid 19 they don’t deliver on time, they don’t know when they will deliver, after 30 minutes wait in the phone, they don’t have any information other than to let you know that the notes that they are putting in the system are incorrect...
How people still send things in Purolator? I know that UPS Is not better but as a customer we should stop giving them business when is clear that they don’t know how to run a business and deliver service."

"I ordered on Amazon with a Prime membership on Friday and selected One-day shipping. I was supposed to receive my order yesterday but Purolator said they couldn't get in because they didn't have my buzzer code, so I went on their website and updated my address information with the buzzer code.

Apparently they tried to deliver earlier but now it says ""Address correction required"". I gave them the correct address, I think the delivery guy just didn't bother to properly deliver my package!

I tried to contact customer support too but no agents were available. I want to return my items now but I have to pay for return shipping which is total bs.

So much for one-day shipping!"
"Hello Nelson,

"Too bad you can't rate with negative star assignation. So, I contacted Puro, was given a tracking number and was told someone would contact me.
Here's the current deal; shipment from Amazon (birthday gift). Ordered June 4th - realize there would be some delay.
Tendered to Puro, by Amazon.
Notified OFD on June 12th.
It is still showing as OFD on June 20th.
No word from Puro.
I used to do track and trace for an international company; it was easier to trace shipments in Chennai, Baghdad and Mumbai than it is to trace a shipment tendered to Puro, in Cornwall, Ontario.
Depends on the depot/management of said depot. Never have problems with my own location. Cornwall needs a new terminal manager."

"Terrible service. This morning tracking said that my package is on truck out for delivery, but 8h later it says 'delayed due to pandemic situation' and then it got back to their sorting facility. Is this 'pandemic situation' just about the driver getting too lazy and deciding to leave early on Friday? That is just unacceptable."

I’ll start this with a “Can we give ZERO STARS?l” They dont even deserve a star. I was expecting a package yesterday or 2 days ago because my girlfriend contacted PUROLATOR to ask if they can DELIVER the package. The customer service said they tried to but no one’s answering. How is that possible? Dont they know how to use the buzzer from apartments? Now i have to go to their warehouse to pick up my package with my swollen feet. Thank you so much

"Can't even begin to describe the hassles when dealing with this travesty of a logistics company. Absolute incompetence at every level and it's almost like inconveniencing people is part of their playbook. How is it possible for a delivery company to have such a hard time actually DELIVERING packages? Given the choice, I will never use Purolator. Literally any other courier service will at least do their jobs. This company is an example of why Canada Post ownership and postal unions need to go. Pathetic."

"I had two deliveries made by purolator in last 6 months and I had bad experience (same experience) both the times. As per the update posted on their website - they attempted delivery and they missed me. Both the times the shipment didn't require any signature at delivery. Well, I live in a condo building with 24 hrs concierge so a missed attempt of delivery is out of question. Upon calling, their cust rep said they will 're-attempt' for delivery next Monday (I called them on Thursday). Within next 2 hours on Thursday itself, they delivered the package!! Then based on what the cust rep said it will be delivered on next Monday? Looks like the rep just made up a random day :) :) :)... I feel like they don't have any quality standard for their service. I don't recommend using Purolator!"

"I WILL NEVER IN MY LIFE USE PURALATOR FOR ANYTHING EVER AGAIN. I recently ordered multiple items and puralator never delivered them, no explanation were given. All I got was my packages may be lost and gave me the option for a refund. After waiting for a week no explanations. This is unacceptable."

"I would to like give Purolator 0 stars instead of 1.
Very disappointing as this has happened before...
I ordered an item on Friday which was supposed to arrive on Tuesday. Tuesday I stayed home day and called them at 3pm to make sure it was scheduled to arrive and they said yes before 9pm. At 8:15pm I checked the tracking again and it said , wrong address, “Address Correction Required”. Which is BS because it was the correct address and the call centre google mapped it and saw it right away. I checked on mt cctv cameras and there was no delivery truck on my street on anywhere near my house that day. I asked them to leave it at the depot so I can pickup the next day. At 7:15am the next day, I called again to confirm I can pickup that day. They confirmed and said I would get a call when its scanned and ready for pickup. At 10:30am, I checked tracking again and it said “Out for Delivery”. Now, Im here sitting and waiting. This was an important part to be installed at a clients up north 2 hrs away. Missed two days waiting for the part and still no update. No compensation from Purolator. They absolutely suck! And I will never ever use them again!!
No ownership in any of this!"
"It's being the third time now. I now understand why Purolator fail to deliver every time, it's because they don't even bring the package with them ahah... The guy just sticked the paper saying ""Sorry, we missed you"" on the door and went away... That's not a delivery service, that just a postal service... ridiculous. Don't pretend to be a delivery service if you don't even try to deliver. Sorry ahah but I'm so frustrated, now i have to take a 40 min ride to go to the nearest pick-up location. Worse company ever. Sorry, not sorry!"

"Been working from home for 3 months and every time I have a Purolator delivery, I'm at home waiting for them to buzz. They never buzz, and just leave the package in the lobby. Have gotten multiple packages stolen. No issues with Canada Post or DHL which actually make the effort to notify you when they arrive with a package. Very frustrating."

"I needed a gasket for the intake air manifold that costs under nine dollars Canadian. Two auto part shops informed me that it cost twenty dollars through Purolator to deliver this lightweight gasket because Purolator has the contract and the main dealer to deliver the gasket from Toronto, Ontario cannot send the gasket by express post which would get to me in 4 days in BC. By Purolator, it would take ten days at a cost of twenty dollars. It sucks all the way around, the parts companies do not have to pay for this contract with Purolator, the consumer that needs the parts have to, It sucks all the way around."
We sent papers too India spent $123.11 when the papers arrived to the receiver was they asked $600 to release the item to them. There is no customs duties on papers. We called purolator Canada they said we don’t know anything they gave the documents to DHL and where no help still. A very bad experience with purolator .
Absolute joke of a place. Never received my packages and it said it was delivered but my cameras can't seem to see them dropping it off.That maybe because you didn't drop it of you thieves.

"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews...anyways, I ordered something off amazon yesterday and it was expected to come today by 9 pm and it came at 5:30! Which is amazing! The product was also in perfect condition :)"
"Terrible, awful, embarrassing..."
"If only Amazon told us before ordering that the delivery courier would be Purolator, I would never have ordered. I was expecting a package today (Sunday) by 9pm, but around 7:10pm, purolator decided my deliver will be rescheduled to tomorrow on a Monday. Which most likely I would miss, because its Monday. I don't understand how they failed to deliver, when the tracking record shows my package arrived at their sorting facility at 10:22am - I live 5 minutes away from their facility. Come tomorrow I will obviously miss my package and I'm going to have to find a time to drive down there, which most likely will be the coming weekend. Also called the customer service and they are horrible. Asked them why my package is being rescheduled when i still have about 2hrs left of ""promised delivery time"" and their reply was ""i dont know, wait till tomorrow"""

"I order on Amazon every week. 98% of deliveries are made by canada post, and there is no issue. The 2% left is Purolator and it is always delayed without notice ( making me wait for a delivery) or just never delivered and sent to the pickup counter. Purolator is known for its bad and unreliable business practices, and should not be used by companies guaranteeing delivery dates because they definitely cannot deal with professional concepts such as being on time and reliable."

"I would leave 0 stars if I could. This is the 2nd time they would mess up my order/delivery. !st time my order was delivered to a totally different unknown address and I had to go back and forth to get a refund. Today, I got a call from them saying they tried to deliver what I ordered but they could not because they were not able to enter the building. I asked why there was no delivery slip considering there were other delivery slips from them for other people and other delivery services. These people never attempted to deliver, they basically took my delivery charge and insisted I come pick up my order myself. If you do not like this type of headache, please avoid using them by all means. They should close shop."

"Never in my life have I been so disgusted with a courier from start to finish. Right from the drivers lying about making delivery attempts to taking days and days to simply have a package held for pickup because I feel I will never get it if I rely on their drivers, I asked to have it held for pickup over 24 hours ago and they are still scanning it as wrong address.

Always just leaving a note without even ringing the door bell and you are then asked to picked it up in a warehouse 20km away in a industrial area.

"Purolator services sucks , ranging from rude customer services to delivery, all are poorly managed and delivered. i was expecting a package which was not trackable by any associate because i missed the delivery at first (There is no 2nd Attempt what so ever), and its been 48 hours now(June 10, 2020) i have no clue where is my package, i visited 2 purolator places near my address where their so called delivery person return unclaimed packages at the end of day but none of them was able to find out where is mine whcih was quite upsetting and frustrating for me . Then i was told it might be with private vender(which was a surprise) because all delivery personals are not working directly for purolator and they mostly follow their own policies and wills in delivery and returns. i was also directed to drive to main sorting and storage facility in ottawa which is 27 km oneway from my address to find out regarding my package( BTW that is the only facility in the middle of no where for ottawa resident in case you miss your package delivery at your address), and encounter with very unwelcoming employee of purlator. since june 8 till now there Tracking website portal is not updated for anyfurther information.

Not very much please with their services at all... be carefull in slecting your courier company espacially think 100 time if you are considering Purolator."

"Purchased a number of small trees that were sent via Purolator Express June 2. Tracking information showed parcel was at Montreal sorting facility with delivery scheduled for the following day, waited all day Wednesday with no delivery. On the evening of June 2 tracking information showed parcel was still at sorting facility in Montreal but delivery date was unavailable. Tried contacting Purolator support via phone, was on hold for over an hour and finally hung up. Tried the virtual chat which only provides basic information but asked if I would like to speak with a live agent. It asked for my contact information and email address and said an agent would be with me, unfortunately no agent to be found. It’s been 5 days now and not a word from Purolator, they have all my info: tracking number, phone number, email. Supplier has had no luck as well finding a pulse either. Even if parcel was delivered tomorrow I’m sure the trees are dead by now. Won’t be using this service in the future, just terrible customer service. *Update* trees were delivered today June 9th - DOA"

"I can’t stand these guys honestly. And I still don’t know why they exist or how they even still run a business. How are you a courier service who delivers to customers but you can leave a notice or get your drivers to call at most? What if the apartment dosent have a buzzer code? The driver just disappears and not say anything? And then we have to opt in for re-delivery?.Or come all the way to your distant locations that don’t make any sense. Your drivers just appear and disappear, I wonder if this company launders money or something because I don’t understand how you do business like this. Get your drivers a damn company phone.


This company needs to get out of this business you’re not in the business for customers, you’re in business to make money and get your drivers to appear, disappear and tell us we have a wrong address. Meanwhile receiving parcels from other courier service is not a problem at all, worst case scenario you go pick up your package at the nearest corner store. There needs to be a petition to close down this business man, it dosent make sense to me.

Do better Purolator or close down this damned business!"

Waited all day for a parcel while I was working outside, a Purolator truck drives by, doesn’t stop but keeps going. About 5PM I get an update that they attempted delivery at around 3:30 but no one answered. I saw the truck drive by.

There isn’t even a delivery slip notice nor any way to get in contact because their customer service is already closed by the time you try to call them.

And now I have no idea where my parcel has ended up because if they left a delivery slip I do not have it."

They are there to help you out. My experience with Purolator was great. I needed a package picked up from my place. I had the pleasure to deal with Yordi. What an amazing customer service staff member that you (Purolator ) have with her. She is a keeper & great on the phone. She told me that they would be here on Thursday between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm. They came at 2:37 PM . I put my mask on to deal with the driver as well as gloves. Remember that it is not just you & I they are dealing with. They are dealing with a lot so be patient!!!

Thank you Purolator but most of all Yordi!!!

"There best arguments for physical stores. Amazon should stop using there services, the fact that they sometimes Purolater make ordering feel like playing russian roulette. Chance are you wil wait days or weeks with no reliable tracking or infos. Customer service agents are useless as it is compagnie policy not to offer any services.

Worst of all, even if you are there they will just leave a peace of paper and leave the package in some warehouse kilometers away. Further than any physical stores you could have went too. So you will end up losing an hour o two of your time and a gazoline bill to get it. God there awful, i cant figure out why there in business."

The worst delivery experience. i definitely recommend to avoid this company and use a concurrent company more reliable.

I spent the whole day at home without leaving any second and literally staying
next to front to don't miss the delivery, but nobody showed-up
and then Online tracking information is updated at 6.12 pm to ""Delivery rescheduled for the next business day"" because of missed delivery when nobody tried to deliver anything.

"Awful. I paid to have a package shipped to me over night and the next day it says in transit. Then a little while later it says due to Covid19 it’s going to be delayed. I call them to see when and they say 2-3 days so I say if you can’t preform the service why would you offer it. The lady just said sorry. I asked if they were going to refund my money for overnight services and the answer was no sorry we don’t offer refunds through Covid19. I understand the rise in the demand for the services but if you take someone’s money to do a job and can’t do that job and not refund them that’s fraud to me. What a joke. I will drive well out of my way and pay more to use another company

No thank you as i already contacted the company I bought my item from and as a good company should refunded me. Not the difference I was only after from Purolator but they actually had customer service and gave me a credit for the entire shipping amount."

I contacted customer service many times and there was no result. They continued claiming the package was delivered, which they decided to tell a week later.

"Was told my desk, which in the tracking info was listed as 82 pounds, had arrived in Montreal on Tuesday May 26th and had an estimated delivery date of Thursday May 28th. May 28th comes around and I have no package. I send them an email which i haven't heard back from. I call them and end up waiting 20 minutes before i disconnect. Friday and nothing arrives and now my tracking info cannot be found cause its past the estimated arrival date. Weekend goes by and i check again on my tracking info Monday June 1st in the morning. At 7:34am my item is changed to unable to deliver due to the weight, Purolator will contact you in 24-48 hours. They KNEW how heavy it was from the original package info. I chat with their help bot and am told it was not delivered cause it requires 2 people to deliver and i ask to chat with a real person. Im transferred to a chat room which disconnects me immediately cause no one is free to talk. I then call them and wait on the phone for 20 minutes just be hung up on. I call them again, waiting about 10 minutes before i call again, and another 20 minutes goes by before I am once again hung up on.

If this is how you treat your customer Purolator, the only explanation you are one of the most used services in Canada is because you paid off everyone to use only you. Your customer service is a joke, your reliability is shotty at best and although there are probably alot of good men and women working in your company, you spit on their reputation and work ethic because clearly you don't care about the customers.

I'm aware there is a pandemic going on, but these problems have been around long before that and using it as an excuse for your pitful work, is disgraceful to us and the hard workers who actually are doing a good job. And to the people who aren't doing a good job, well shame on you for dragging the rest of your teamates and fellow employees through the mud.

A very angry customer."

Never ring or call so they can pretend they tried to deliver and then you have to pick up your package.

"Every single time, the driver simply leaves a notice in my mailbox without trying to deliver the package: no knock at the door, definitely no ringing the bell. So every time, I have to go to the office, which is 20 km away in an industrial park. None of the other courrier services do that. None. I would never use their services if I had the choice, but when I order online, sometimes, I don't have a choice."

"I have been waiting for my package... no biggie. Check tracking this morning to find that they tried to delivery but couldn’t cause they didn’t have my phone number correct, or entry code into the building which I might add other shippers don’t need... also no biggie.
What really is the crux of my issue is it is now going to take them five more days to come back and I need to be at home....
so I offered to pick up today only to be told I can’t pick up for three days...
How do they justify holding parcels to ransom.
This is complete non sense"

"Delivery scheduled for today. I'm home, waiting for the package. Status update shows up on the online tracker that the address needs to be updated. The address is accurate, my phone was provided and I'm home. Tried the online chat to resolve. It's a bot that just asks auto questions and then creates a ticket. That's not chat, might as well be a form! Called Customer Service, 30min on hold (the 1st time). They tell me I need to provide a buzzer # to the driver (bc they can't call my cell or look my name up in the directory for some reason). I provide the buzzer #. They tell me they're going to contact the driver and to stay on hold. They then hang up on me. I call back, 40min on hold so far. You'd think they'd call me back after the call was dropped."

"BOUCHERVILLE. my package was supposed to be delivery today the 29 May 2020 . so i call them at 8:30 AM to give them help by saying the appartement block door is unlock and the buzzer is broke , the support told me call at 10 am so we can page them with the info, so i say put a note on the package in advance so i dont need to call again for a easy thing to do , She was not happy and hang up, At 10 Am they switch the delivery day for a unknown day due to pandemic , i'm with AMAZON PRIME , they give zero option to choose witch delivery carrier i want , i can't even change it in my profile and i did many complaint about it , Amazon have zero power to change due to contract with Purolator , only thing they can do is ask for a refund or replacement with Purolator AGAIN , it is completly stupid to give a replacement with the same usless carrier , they dont even call the warehouse to get more info about why they switch to unknown day etc, NOTHING ,i'm disgusted because amazon don't do pression to purolator for bad support. Catherine you wasting your time as i did today with your 3 support employee. You do automatic message is a proof how laughable your company are. Send you email of my tracking number so you do a debate like always to protect your laziness company ,by the way you are the first person i talked too this morning and look what happen."
"One time I had to pick up something with my ID at Guelph location. The staff deliberately ignored me standing there right in front of her. I know she saw me, she looked straight at me and then actually asked someone else who was not even standing in line. If she doesn't want to serve a customer, then Purolator should replace her with someone who wants to do the job. There are people out there who will appreciate that they even have a job. As for shipping, although I have only used Purolator a few times, so far I have no complaint.
Edit to add reply : the location is on Massey Rd in Guelph ON. Date and time I forgot. I think it's 147 or 148 Massey rd."

"I'm a recurrent customer of a store in Toronto that have pretty much only Purolator as choice for parcel handling. With more than one occasion where their employees not even bother to ring the bell or knock the door before leaving a notice for the parcel to be picked up (I was at home), this time under the excuse of the pandemic, at a cost of 33$ for a fast delivery, their tracking system states that the delivery time is unknown after 48 hours the parcel was picked up. I live in the surrounding area of Montreal and the store is 6 hours away drive. In 48 hours this parcel could do this distance 8 times! I wrote to the manager of that store requesting him to offer other optional companies for the deliveries of their parcels. Purolator is just Canada Post disguised as the Little Red Riding Hood."

"Again, Purolator used to my go to shipper. Going back to UPS. At least they are not to lazy to deliver my package to my apartment door. Was home all day yesterday waiting for package and they left a ""sorry we missed you"" sticker. What's the point of courier if I have to pick it up myself? You need to be upfront and call your business what it is, ""Not a door to door service"" but will ship to depot for pickup. Never again!"

"My wife ordered Dell’s laptop. Was showing as “on track for delivery” on Monday, May the 25th. Close to 9:00PM I’ve checked the entrance to our townhouse and to my surprise found a “missed delivery” notice. We have a rather loud doorbell, and were home the whole day, afternoon and evening (good Covid 19 times).

Notice instructed us to pick up the package tomorrow in a store 6 blocks away - my wife went there on Tuesday, only to found that the store is temporarily closed - due to Covid 19, of course. I called Purolator support and after 30+ minutes of waiting got the actual live person. The line was terrible and the person barely spoke English, but he offered me to either pick up the package on 1378 Pender St. location (this horror story takes place in fair Vancouver, Canada), or to have it shipped to our address again. Now, either option was available only on Thursday, as according to the Purolator support person they were not working on Wednesdays (???). I opted for another delivery.

Today, Wednesday, I checked the order on the website once more, hoping to see new delivery date and the updated status - and was surprised to find that the package is waiting to be picked up, but on the airport location! And it looked like that Wednesday was very much a working day. On the same website there was the information that package can be picked up by other person than being addressed to, for as long as the personal Id shows that the person lives on the same address.

So I thought that I can spare my wife the drive to the airport, and armed with delivery stub and couple of Ids drove to the airport. That was a big mistake. Turned out that I cannot pick up the laptop instead of her, as that’s against Dell’s policy. Of course, there wasn’t a word about *possible exceptions* on Purolator’s website. It simply states that you can pick up a package that wasn’t addressed directly to you, for as long as you can produce the document showing that you live on the delivery address. Not true. Apparently there are exceptions. I was one.

No amount of pleading and explaining the whole ordeal made an impression on Purolator’s clerk, nor her supervisor. They were listening to my long and boring story with some sort of trained stoicism, so at some point I figured that they must be listening to much worse on a daily bases, to the point of zoning out completely. This is where I turned back to my car, drove back home, picked up my wife, drove her back to the airport, so that she was able to, finally, pick her new laptop.

It is beautiful and she loves it. I’ll make sure to never-ever buy anything that can possibly be shipped by Purolator. Will make a point to always ask about it.



Ed: my response to Catherine, also sent to Purolator’s customer care email address.

Dear Catherine,

Shipment # was BHC000371970

Think that this experience went far beyond customer’s happiness or unhappiness. Let’s focus just on facts of the “case”:

1) Driver never bother to ring a doorbell. I have logs from my Ring door camera showing somebody indeed being in the front of my door at 7:48 on May the 25th, but they didn’t push the doorbell. Nor they knocked - we would have heard them, we were at home.

2) The “missed delivery” stub sent us to the pickup place that was (and still is) closed due to Covid-19.

3) Support person on your support line (a terrible experience on its own) told me that your company doesn’t work on Wednesdays, and also gave me the wrong pick-up address (1378 Pender St.).

4) Figured (on your site) that the package was actually on Vancouver airport. Used chat feature and was actually advised that I can pick up the package myself (although it was addressed to my wife), for as long as I can present the Id that shows that I live on the same address.

5) Which proved to be bogus information. Your clerks at Vancouver airport office also showed no flex nor sympathy for the whole sequence of “unfortunate events” - I was in for another round of driving before we finally got our little package.

Catherine, I happen to work as an architect for large systems integration/ customer support (ordering, billing, delivering, etc.) software. Your company is simply dysfunctional, on a several different levels. Yes, it makes me sad, but that’s entirely beside the point.

Best regards,"

"I don't know why Amazon choose this company. My place is an old condo, no access code or anything. We only use an access card to enter the building. This company always say their workers have no cell phone so they cannot contact me to open the door for them. It costs me extra work to deal with Purolator.
On the other hand, other companies have no such problem. They just called me and asked me to open the door for them, that's it. Isn't it an easy way to deliver?"

When I order the product they did not tell me they wouldn’t ship to a PO BOX but no one contacted me at all to let me know! Then I gave my new home address (asked 3 different times if they come out here) they said yes definitely ship there no problem but then check shipping to find out that they DONT SHIP HERE
so DONT EVER USE THEM THEY ARE CRAP"

"Purolator doesn't deliver packages. They stick ""we're sorry we missed you"" notices on people's doors. With 2 people working from home, and a dog that barks at the door whenever the bell is rung - Purolator managed to quietly stick a delivery notice on our door without anyone noticing.

- They don't ring the doorbell
- They don't attempt to deliver at all

If your business model is to have people ship to a depot and have customers pick it up - then make that your business model and charge your customers as such. Give me a call when the package is at your depot, and save both of us the frustration of having a fleet of people driving vehicles PRETENDING to deliver things.
When I buy something and pay for delivery - I'm paying for actual delivery to my residence...not to ship it to some drop location so that I have to drive there, wait in line, and pick up the package so that I can deliver to my home myself."

"Do NOT use Purolator! Terrible, horrible, abysmal - non-existent service!

Have been waiting for a package since Thur. May 21. No delivery received or attempt made. Online shows ""Address correction required"" which is just garbage.This is an Amazon order that has used the same address for hundreds of deliveries. Every other courier service has delivered but not Purolator. I just received an update this morning, May 26, 9:50 AM (20 minutes ago) that they ""Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible"".

This package is being delivered to my office address. We have been here in the office since 9:00 AM. There has been absolutely NO ATTEMPT whatsoever for a delivery from Purolator.

Purolator, you should check your employees because they are NOT doing their job!

Do NOT use Purolator - we certainly never will for our business!"

I have sent emails requesting some info or an update to which I received no reply.
I did connect with someone through chat that told me they didn't have any more info about my package..... What does that even mean..?

Bought other items later from Costco and Walmart and all shipped after this package was shipped and everything arrived but Purolator does not have any clue where that shipment is gone."

"I ordered two items online on different dates within a week of each other. Both providers use Purolator. For the first item, the status update was delayed, so that I missed the delivery very early in the morning, even though I was home. But there was no card left to say that they were unable to deliver - I only found out through the tracking status online. After calling Customer Service, a new delivery was scheduled for today. In the meantime, the tracking information on the other item also indicated expected delivery date as today. I have been waiting all day and no delivery of either item. Purlolator should at least have a system where the delivery person calls within a four hour span or when he is in the neighbourhood to say he will be dropping it off. Many other technicians and home delivery services do that; there's no reason why Purolator can't."

"a week of waiting for a package 20 min away from my house with no status change. customer service is a joke. canada needs to boycott purolator and canada post. they are both too used to being the monopoly and getting away with it. millenials today need to get a grip and take a stand like real people used to. ups and fed ex need to boost thier canadian presence.


Edit for the reply i cant reply to:
i got it already after having to talk to 2 different people and having to give a description of a package that i have no idea what it looks like as i was the receiver. just lucky was amazon and they put thier sticker all over everything. rating stands as 1 star, would be 0 if could. ill pay extra to receive or send anything by fed ex or ups anymore. least i know things get to where they are supposed to. dont know why purolator just doesnt have the same name as canada post, they own 91 percent of it and share the same customer experience. too many monopolies in Canada. Competition is drastically needed here so the big money grabbers get the wake up call thats so desperately needed here.
\
Edit on the edit now:
got another package, too bad amazon dont let you say who to ship by. this time it looks like the box which contained car window tint, something that cant be banged around or even dented or it fails, but it looks like the delivery driver decided they wanted to play some truck soccer with the box. dented, crushed, tape barely holding it together. These copy and paste responses from their social media reps need to worry less about how many replies they can post and instead worry about the quality of their employees they are getting to deliver. internal quality review by an outside company is drastically needed, but like every other monopoly in canada, nothing will change except the yachts Canadians keep paying for the CEOs."

"My package keeps getting delayed — I get updates saying that they need a buzzer code & that my address is incorrect, my address is definitely not incorrect and I also give the buzzer code. — I spoke to many agents and all they say is that everything has been updated already and that they cannot confirm which day it’ll go for delivery.
Today I got an update saying that they “attempted” to deliver my package and that I should look for a notice of the attempted delivery — no they did not “attempt” to deliver, they didn’t even show up to the building (I live in a apartment)
— I sat in front of the building for most of the day just to get my package and I only saw one Purolator vehicle and it just drove by the building and no worker even came out of the vehicle to “deliver” my package.

Despite making sure last week that the right address was in the system and then double checking this morning the parcel was not delivered.
When asked to speak to a supervisor i was told one would call, yet, just like their customer service and deliveries, its non exsistent.

How you guys are still operating is beyond me, well actually no, i know, you steal peoples money.
Even before Covid you guys sucked.


Just to update after speaking to a supervisor named “Mike”. He had no care that purolator buggered up, no answer to why i was assured last week this was changed but the change was only put in today.

Interesting how I`ve never had ANY delivery issues with any other service. The Purolator delivery guys have no way to contact their HQ and no way to get in touch with client apparently.If I ever see amazon is using them for a delivery I`ll just wait more days and get it through a reliable service. Utter garbage."

"Another delay in delivery!!!!!! Was to be delivered on the 15th, spoke with a customer
service rep who confirmed delivery would be delivered on the 19th. Received a text message saying today saying “your package is on its way”! No package “on its way”. Current update from Purolator - “delayed for another 2 to 3 business days”! Purolator is a joke!!!!! Amazon rules!!!! FedEx and UPS so much better. Even Canada Post is more reliable than Purolator.....which isn’t saying much!"
"Hello,

"Purolator turns good companies into bad ones.

After waiting for a package for 1 month, Amazon said Purolator lost it.
Cool, thanks, and its ""out of stock"".

so thanks for fkng me over once again, I can't even use amazon anymore."

Absolutely crappy service Before I ordered the product I called them and asked can we get over night delivery. Absolutely I was told it is going too be expensive though. Ordered food product from Ontario to Alberta paid 125 dollar's to get about a 10 pound package over night. Got it five days later and the product was totally garbage. There excuse covid 19 BS just a very incompetent company never again
Purolator has been masters of pay and pickup your items for awhile. They like to say UPS stands for Use Purolator Stupid; however UPS at least delivers on time and is not making me do my own pickups and deliveries. Purolator is like ordering a pizza for delivery and after an hour the pizza place calls to say they need you to pick it up now.

"Worst delivery service not just in Canada, but also on the global level. I have a front desk agent who always takes the deliveries from different couriers. Apparently my shipment showed they were unable to access to my door, even though the concierge was sitting there at the time they attempted to deliver. And the Purolator delivery guy doesn't even bother to leave a slip on the entrance so I don't know where my package is right now."

"On May 13th my package said out for Delivery. Then a hour later said delayed due to sorting error and that it would be delivered on the 14th
On May 14th I called customer service and they said my Package would be delivered on Friday the 15th. They did however start a trace on my package. On Friday I checked the tracking info and it says Delivery unavailable.
Customer service insists that the package is at the North Depot but it's not lost. Apparently a tracing Specialist who is in Ontario is going to go find my package that is not lost or missing at the Edmonton Alberta North Depot. Witch is only 11km from my house.
My not lost package is a hostage, Purolator won't answer any of my questions and has insisted this entire time they know where my package is. Even after asking me what it looks like for they can try to find it. Also why can no one answer my questions on how long Puralator is allowed to keep my not lost package."
"they don't even deserve one star, the worst service ever...
do not use, do not buy anything that uses this crap company to ship because you probably wont get it till weeks later..

they should get a 0 star rating...

keep away."
"Purolator is the worst of the worst! I've waited for my parcel from Ontario to be delivered in Calgary since 24 April. It's been sitting in Calgary since May 5. Today is May, 16. They say that, because of Covid-19, there will be a one to three-day delay on deliveries. I'm okay with that, but over THREE WEEKS??? Yesterday, finally, I received an email from them, saying my parcel is out for delivery. I was SO happy and I did not step a foot anywhere so I could be here when the driver arrived. At 6pm I realized it would not happen. I looked at my email and saw ""Your parcel was delivered"". Seriously???? There was no parcel at MY front door, so where did it go? I immediately phoned a supervisor of Purolator and he casually informed me that I'll only be able to contact the ""tracing team"" on Monday and it could take two days or longer for them to trace my parcel. From all the negative reviews about this company on Google, I'm clearly not the only one who thinks they are terribly inefficient and unreliable. But why do individuals and companies keep on using their services??? They should not be in business! Their motto is: ""Purolator. It's not a package. It's a promise."" What a lie! What a JOKE!!!
Next time when I order anything online, I'll make sure the seller will NOT use Purolator as a shipper. If they do, I'll buy elsewhere."
"UPDATE: Just got a notification and for the FOURTH freaking time, they failed to deliver again. THIS IS MADNESS!!!


If I can give 0 star I would to reflect their delivery process. Zero effort at all and plain stupid.

Three times (personally and for one package only, not adding the griefs they cause at work as well) they messed up the delivery of my package with reasoning that make no sense. No entry/buzzer code, wrong address, etc.. Like what the F?? Canada post and other services never missed delivering my packages.. They even call me to ask for instructions on what to do next, if I wasn't available.

For one delivery task, they messed up 3 times giving different reasons.. stupid, lazy reasons.

First, ""No buzzer code"", so I contacted their support to add/EMPHASIZE the buzzer code which is actually already on the shipping address..

Second time, they messes up again saying the ""address is wrong"".. I'm like om f g...

Third time, contacted their support again and they told me it could take 72 hours to complete the shipping address change (WHY?? what do you need to change??).. I almost flipped my table reading this.. holy s**t.

Hope these reviews will reach Purolator management, and if does, hoping they will actually care because this stupidity is prevalent.

But I think their best action here is to ""CEASE and DESIST"" their operation.. It's just stupid for real.. How are they still operational is beyond me..."
"Waiting for my package.When I track it at purolator apps,... then suddenly SENT TO SENDER...Customer service is horrible never reply on email or call.They are lazy to deliver."
"First time I decided to write up my review about #purolator which is #purolatest after hundreds of time dissatisfaction with this company, I am not surprised to see all negative feedbacks and being 1start shipping company does not surprise me there should be Negative starts below zero this company sucks always find a reason to excuse itself now is covid19 I am just FEDUP with purolator but it is my choice some people like companies and organizations ship my items! this package coming from TDSB I am asking any company or organizations deal with purolator PLEASE PLEASE STOP SHIPPING WITH PUROLATOR WR ARE SUFFERING AND FEDUP WITH THIS COMPANY!

I JUST got off phone with another RUDE representative, drivers are nice though, ALWAYS LATE, ALWAS MAKE ME WAITING FOR MY PACKAGE, HOURS on hold, delays to next days and RUDE staffs, at the end of i have to drive half way of Toronto to pick the package, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH may times I had to cancel with orders with certain company that ship with purolator

"Purolator is horrible! They receive a package on 7 May 2020 for delivery by 14 May 2020. On 14 May 2020 someone figures out that at 6 KG it is too heavy--yes 6 KG is apparently ""too heavy""--and a special appointment is required. Do they reach out? Of course not, the first time we find out is when we track the package on 14 May 2020 to figure out why it hasn't arrived....Then comes two days of hell trying to get in touch with Purolator to arrange delivery of this 6 KG package that is supposedly too heavy for one person to deliver????? They tell you to book a delivery appointment on-line...but you can't. They tell you to call to book an appointment...but you can't. They tell you that you can arrange to pick-up the package....but you can't. They tell you to reach out to customer service to book at appointment, but you can't. All you can do is wait until...at some unknown time when they get around to it...they will deliver your package...maybe. They will try to blame it on COVID-19, but they can't....based on the reviews, this problem with Purolator pre-dates COVID-19."
"Never again will I have something delivered by Purolator. They don’t care where they drop your package and left my first package out in the open at the bottom of my driveway where everyone could see it and easily rip it off. It was an expensive item so I was lucky that I was home to retrieve it right away.

Two weeks later I had another package that was supposed to be delivered that was identical to the first one and Purolator claimed my location wasn’t a ‘service point’ so they handed it off to Canada Post. What the hell!!? Obviously the driver was just being lazy. Purolator, you suck!"
"Absolutely awful service. 30+ mins wait time for everyday for three days now and still not able to speak with a rep. Online chat and assistant are worse than useless. Delivery driver did the bare minimum. I hardly ever use mail delivery, but I will go out of my way to recommend everyone that Purolator is as useful as strapping a delivery to half-blind donkey and hoping it finds its way. I hate you so much Purolator."
"By far one of the worst!
I do not have a single even average experience with them. The latest experience is a delivery from Amazon that is said it has been delivered but I have not received anything.

If I only good give a lower rating."

"Hey Purolator, +100 days and counting to deliver a package that normally takes 5 days from Canada to the US. Still waiting. 49975637403 ** US Case 11328976

If the customer reads this. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, they are a scam at a high level. I sent more than 8 boxes. Some were broken, some contents inside were broken and Purolator set they are not responsible. And after 100 days still waiting for a box and the support just say bla bla bla.

"This company has fallen quite a way from being an average delivery company. Slow service and delivery people who refuse to use a building dialing system. It's easier for the driver to just stick the missed delivery sticker rather then call the customer. Why make an effort when it's more fun to inconvenience the customer and make them go to their depot to get your package. I always try to request any other delivery company. Sad to say any delivery company is better.

Update:
Ince again, only Purolator can achieve another missing package. Like the last it will take a week from pickup in the same city to delivery in the same city. I will request next time I order from this company that they use just about anyone else to ship through. What a joke and they use this pandemic as an excuse. It's funny that the 3 other companies that have delivered to my address do not use this as an excuse. True it hard on the delivery companies but the others still deliver on time. Yes even Canada Post who I have come to admire my delivery people. The people Amazin use or the company used should be an example or a blueprint of how to get the job done in today's environment. That being said there are some fantastic people working there. Let's see it in the results. Customer satisfaction.

Final Update:
The package did come in. Purolators web site tracking system seemed to have lost it for two days. A very nice delivery person dropped it off around 7 PM last night. However, what Purolat is doing is subcontracting the delivery service to another delivery company. This explains the bad service for the past few years. So, stop blaming Covid when it only started in March of 2020. Your poor service has been going on for the past 2 to 3 years."

"EDIT!!! (SORRY PUROLATOR)
Purolator was refusing to tell me which “agent” was holding my package to deliver to me and did not update anything in the tracking online. I called multiple agents and earned that SWIFT MESSENGER SERVICE is helping purolator out with shipments. contact SWIFT to know where your package is.

I read these reviews right after I saw my two packages were shipped via purolator! and I thought, no! no way. purolator is a highly established business and network therefore something must be fishy about these reviews.
20 days later, there is nothing fishy about the abundance of bad reviews. it’s the TRUTH. Purolator has pulled the ultimate donald trump impossible. on some we’d see you around and think you’re all put together and proper, until we actually have to count on you, then you act like a fool making comical decisions that are the opposite of what your mission is and/or that put the end receiver in great risk. CEO CFO COO, READ THIS AND FIX UP"
"Where to begin...

First and foremost I would like to say Purolator has delivered packages to my address in the past with no issues before, as two weeks ago I have received a package from them. That being said, the completely dropped the ball on delivering a bike I ordered that was ""supposedly delivered to my door"" on May 4. At the time of this delivery that they claimed actually happened, my entire family was home and we received no phone call or knock on our door. We live in an apartment complex where you must buzz in to enter the building. I was even tracking the package and 10 minutes later it said it was delivered, I opened my front door to see nothing there. A week prior a delivery person knocked on our door to deliver a package from the same store (Sport Chek), which was *handed* to us. This time around this was not the case, and I am looking for answers to why this process was not the same.

I contacted customer service, who then checked the delivery person's GPS to see if they did stop by my building, to which they claim they did and immediately closed my customer service ticket... except me and my entire family can confirm this person didn't knock on our door/make an effort to contact our apartment? I work from home and can easily hear if someone knocked on my door. I even checked our building lobby to see if they just left it there, and confirmed with our superintendent that this was not the case. I have contacted the shipper to see what else can be done, because it looks like Purolator doesn't have anymore insight or help for me. Either way, I am convinced I will never receive my package and will look for some sort of refund/claim.

+1 complaint, Purolator seems to have a MAJOR glitch with sites that use the ""Address 2"" category when filling out shipment details. I see other people have complained about this issue, and can confirm this is an ongoing thing as I have also experienced it, with an order I paid for through Best Buy. I had no issues with this when other carriers (Canada Post/UPS/Fed Ex) deliver items to my door, but Purolator seems to perhaps accidentally cut off this part of the Address details when processing orders. For the record I use the same payment system each time for years, and have never had an issue with this until recently with Purolator. (I have emailed their customer support to get my address updated, but they have not done so over the weekend, thus I still won't receive my package today.)

+2 complaint: I also I spent 5 minutes with their Automated Live Chat AI only for it to ""transfer me to a Live Agent"", to which no one was available and I could not go any further in this process but to close the window.

To end this essay/rant, I would like to say mistakes do happen and with everything that is going on in today's world, it's completely understandable that processes may have changed. However, I still need to resolve my main issue as I paid for a package I have not received due to no fault of my own."

"I hate Purolator now. They've kidnapped my mother's gift and I can't get it. They never tried to deliver it, their own tracking confirms that. They've admitted it's their fault. So I'm supposed to drive to another city to pick up the parcel at their depot. They want me to bring the attempted delivery card the driver left with me when I pick it up. I cannot pick it up without the card. Okay. Except the card doesn't exist because no delivery was ever attempted and no card was ever left. So I drove all the way there to pick it up for absolutely no reason. I still don't have my parcel. They have it and I cannot get it. No mother's day gift for my aging mother. I'm beyond upset and will no longer use them for shipping for any reason."
"My University shipped a textbook to me through Purolator. My unit number was in the second adress line like I have it for every shipment, but the package was not delivered due to ""incorrect adress"".
I tried calling customer service and using their online chat, but couldn't get through to anyone. It took 3 days for me to finally get ahold of someone.

The customer service rep I spoke to was nice, and was as helpful as he could be. Unfortunately, due to company policy literally any time I have a package coming through purolator I will have to go pick it up. My condo buzzer doesn't work, so I usually leave a note in the lobby asking drivers to leave it there. EVERY single other delivery company does this. Not purolator. They drive to the condo and when I can't answer the buzzer they bring it to therir depot. So every time anything is ordered through them I am forced to drive a long distance to pick it up.

My University bookstore is less than 2 miles away, The depot is more than 14k. It is ridiculous that I have to drive further to pick up books from Purolator than I would to pick up my books if the store was open (Covid).

EVERY OTHER COMPANY manages to deliver packages to me and do a good job. I will be trying to request a different courier anytime I order something.I will be canceling any items that ship with them in the future and letting the vendor know why.

Because of Purolator I now have to drive to a pickup location as a vulnerable person during Covid-19 to pick up a textbook that was closer to me when it was shipped in the first place. I am out a textbook... hopefully I am able to get it soon enough to study for my first test."
"Firstly, I paid for three-day shipping and it took five days. Okay, not too bad, better than Canada Post being ten days late for xpresspost during non-pandemic times. Opened my package when it arrived, and despite ""fragile, handle with care"" being marked in bold, red letters on all sides of the box, clearly they don't know what that meant or simply cannot read, because 1/4 of the contents were smashed or damaged!!! DO NOT TRUST Purolator to handle your fragile goods - you could put an egg in the middle of a 4' square box and they'll find a way to break it!"
"First time using Purolator and will definitely be my last.

After having them claim a problem with my address I have always used and reading others reviews I had tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but they truly are just a terrible service.

Will not respond to email or answer phone calls for 4 days now.

I paid a fair bit extra for express shipping and I ended up having one package delivered to a wrong location in Truro on Monday resulting in me having to file a claim, the second package arrived to Purolator in my home town of Truro 5 days ago and still has not been delivered to me.

Keep in mind this package travelled across Canada in 5 business days! Really says something about Purolator in Truro!

UPDATE- Amazon contacted me and told me to go ahead and make another claim as it seems that they have lost my second parcel. Unreal."

"First timer using them. Look things happens. Which is why I even gave it 2 stars. I want more confidence in this company. As of right now, they DID email me about my missing/ entitled ""delivered"" package. The email stated that the vendor authorized this unsigned package at delivery. (Apparantly being Covid times & a Sunday I was not home?!) Untrue. I was, all day. No knock, no ring, no email, no phone call. Whats the definition of a vendor? Im assuming Amazon. So I contacted them and they do not authorize signatures and/ or unsigned packages. They stated it's Purolator's decision. SO I wouldnt be upset if a package was late, but the tracking information doesn't go as far as their services in Vaughan, Ontario. No proof of delivery at my house address. AND no signature. No paper slip suggesting it be at Shoppers ie. nearest Canada Post. So far, Purolator you have (maybe non-purposefully) lied about a vendor's authorization. Just stating the facts. Please compensate me for this. This happened ~2 weeks ago- still persisting.
Only evidence given""it was left on a porch"". Generally speaking, most homes have porches or quick answer out. ""Our GPS shows it came to that address"". Alright, fair. Wheres the slip? Wheres the tracking info. needed for my end? Apparantly 2 parties (me, Amazon.ca support crew) in this do not have actual proof it came to my address, it halted tracking in Vaughan Ontario Canada.
This has never happened with fedex, canada post & prime delivery. They were late sometimes, which is fine, never M.I.A"
"I have had the worst experience from Purolator and the worst part is you get no apology or anything. They collected my parcel from Best Buy in Toronto on the 9th of April. Even though my address was in Toronto, I could see on their tracking system that it left Toronto and went to Montreal and other cities far from my address. I called them about 6 times and the response was that they were trying to locate my package. They had me recent invoices from best but etc. Told them my address had changed and that they had to deliver to new address when they eventually find it. Well, I will tell you now that a month later the tv has been delivered but to the old address. Their customer service lady Wendy Morly says yes she was aware I changed addresses but there was nothing they could do so they decided to just take it to the address I don’t live anymore. No apology no nothing. Just stated as a fact and that i have to suck it up because it is what it is. I requested to speak to the supervisor and she said he would be the one calling me back. Now I have to foot the bill of moving the tv to my current address. Unbelievable."

"Horrible service. I live in a 3 floor apartment building. I received a slip on my door with the pick up location being down the street. I arrive to pick up my package and the person tells me it's an hour from me so I need to call PuroLATER to have them deliver it. I called and they confirmed the correct address and will be delivered by the next day. The updates had indicated the address was updated, out for delivery and suddenly ""address correct required - no code"" when clearly someone had already entered to leave a slip. Then another update saying ""wrong address"". I went on the chat to correct this and was given a case number. Nothing has been updated since and I have no idea where my package nor how to hold anyone accountable for what was supposed to be a simple delivery, is now a headache. Calling customer service does nothing as I am unsure again how to old anyone working here accountable. Will i ever receive my package? PLEASE STOP USING THEM!"

I called purolator to make sure , they are now telling me that it’s going to be on May 8th and that they are not sure it could be delayed again.

"I was supposed to receive a very important document on Friday. It never arrived. I called Saturday and was told to call on Monday and they would page the driver. Called Monday, spent over an hour on hold. Explained the urgency of receiving the document by early afternoon. The agreed to page the driver. Package did not arrive until 10 am on Tuesday. The document was picked up at a location about one hour away from Toronto and was sent by Purolator Express. Failure to receive it on time costs us hundreds of dollars. Never use Purolator!

"They tried to deliver a package to me that I had ordered on amazon. At first my shipping info said that they couldnt find my address. Then, a few hours later, it updated again saying it doesnt exist. LOL. My apartment building has been here. In the exact same place. Since 1983. I've seen multiple purolator vehicles parked in my parking lot before so apparently only certain drivers can locate my supposedly off the radar apartment building.
I've ordered from amazon before and everything got here when it shipped with fedex, prime delivery and canada post.

I hope I'm never unlucky enough to have my packages shipped with purolator again."

"I was suppose to get a package on Thursday. They couldn't find my address and I thought fine, my house is quite new. So I called and got my address validated. Monday they finally said it was on the way, so I was hoping to get it today (Tuesday) as by 9:30am they said it was on vehicle for delivery.

I waited all day and by 6:10pm they updated my shipment and said AGAIN they couldn't find my address. This is BS. I've ordered items on Amazon and they had no problem finding my address.

"Every time I buy something and it is sent by this mediocre company, it represent a problem to me. Several times, while being at home, they do not even ring or knock at the door, they simply leave a paper indicating that I have to pick up the package. Besides, they always send me to a place 30 Km far from my place which is a lack of consideration and also very poor from the logistics point of view. If there is a 0 star grade I would give it, no doubt.

I tried to call them... First time 35 minutes on the phone, no answer. Second time 15 minutes on the phone... Same. Last try I give up after another 15 minutes wait. Completely disrespectful."

"Garbage company. Excuse after excuse. The last 2 excuses are the generic blanket pandemic, that's been holding up my package. Reality is they favour urban areas and rural can wait. Last week's excuses included ""natural disaster"" and ""no road access due to construction"". Both BS reason, when that package finally arrived the driver just tossed it on.my front.porch in the pouring rain. Amazon needs to rethink the exclusive delivery partner crap with Purolator. Ive talked to customer care twice today, once was told yup it's on the truck and will be delivered today, surprise I get a delay notification and call again. This time the agent is straight with me and told me it never got on a truck. Hey Purolator why exactly didn't my package get.on the truck yet my neighbours did?. It was ordered from Amazon same as mine a few days after mine yet mine gets ""delayed"" enough is enough"

"Absolute worst courier company there is. With an over 50% ownership by Canada Post, it is completely understandable. Things are especially bad due to the pandemic which they are using as a blanket excuse for their incredibly bad delivery times. Someone tell me why it takes 5 plus business days for a package at their Mount Hope Depot in Hamilton to make a 10 min journey to an address in Ancaster not more than 15 min away?? This was/is a domestic shipment. It was not coming from anywhere other than the Hamilton area. How is it I can order 90% of any items from Amazon and have them arrive at my address in less than 3 days? I can tell you...they use Intelcom, a private nonunion service. It's just ridiculous. I could have made the item faster than having it delivered. I would also like to know why there have been ZERO advancements in tracking shipments since the early days of the internet?? Its 2020 and the shipment tracking hasn't changed in 25 years. Want to track your shipment online...go ahead and get not descript messages like ""Your shipment has been delayed""...wow no SH_T! Or tracking info that hasn't updated in days. If my package is sitting at a shipping depot...say it. There has got to be a way to provide more up to date tracking info in 2020. I would give 0 stars if I could."

"I get that the paranoia dictates how business is done .. but it would be nice to be kept updated .. my 3 day delay is now up to 7 as the customer service says it wont come off the truck till tuesday or wednesday next week.and it was to be delivered last wednesday. I have taken my last day off work to be here for the delivery of something that may or may not get off a truck somewhere at some depot. Really feel let down for the money that's charged a little more communication would be a bonus. The ladies at customer service were nice but not super informed or helpful
So the update begins a trace has been started as soon as I provide a description (done 4 times ) last time this pack was scanned was in bc .. nobody has a clue where its located.. I was advised to give it til july before they consider it lost ..april 29th was the delivery date and nobody has seen this box since the 27th..and again nobody calls to communicate... I paid for the mailing and didnt get the service , anywhere else and that would not be acceptable . Unfortunately 1 star is to many in my book UPDATE : now we have a 2 week delay til delivery on a package that nobody seems to know where it is"

"****update**** asked to email customer service in the reply, I did this and surprise surprise no return email!!! I still do not have my purchase*****
I refuse to buy anything online that is shipped through Purolator. Item was shipped on Sunday for delivery on Monday and everyday there is a new excuse. They blamed sorting issue, then pandemic issue then the address was wrong...waited on hold for 42 minutes, to provide correct address (they had correct address all long)
The next day same issue! Waited on hold for 37 minutes and told it would ship Thursday. Now it’s Friday and it’s “at sorting facility” I needed this item ASAP and I could have gone to Walmart and naught myself....such a huge waste of time and major inconvenience.
This is not the first issue I have had, but it will be the last"

Ordered express shipping for my package last Friday (bad call but was willing to wait till Monday or Tuesday to get it shipped). Says it arrives at a sorting facility on Wednesday and is out for delivery on the same day but gets returned back to the same facility due to pandemic (understandable I suppose?). Gets sent out Thursday for delivery but gets returned for not having the buzzer code (Which not their fault that EB Games doesn't give an option to provide such information). But sending a request to update the address on a Thursday afternoon and being told Friday morning that when they deliver it'll update the tracking information and that they won't deliver it anytime today is kinda insane. It's gonna take more than a day to update the shipping address with a buzzer code?

"The same story as the dozens of poor souls below me. I understand that there is a pandemic going on, but my package has been out for delivery, delayed at sorting facility, then to random towns for the past three days. I ordered this package on the 22nd of April with amazons 2 DAY shipping which I PAY for.

They have not responded to a single email or service ticket, every time i call their ""customer support"" i wait for 40 mins with absolutely no answer.

My item, a bed frame which I literally need to sleep on and was expensive, has been sitting in toronto due to weather ""delays"" for three days now even tho its JUST RAINING LIGHTLY, I live in whitby, it is literally a 40 min drive maximum.

Do yourself a favor and never use this service. Ive had multiple other packages delivered during this time frame by canada post and ups, there is no other explanation other than purolator being unable to ship items properly."

I ordered an item a week and a half ago, the tracking number hasn’t been updated in several days, and they won’t even tell me when my item is coming or where it even is. I don’t think they even know where my item is. It’s a $300 Nintendo switch lite. That I already paid for. I want my item, and I don’t even know if it’s coming.

Unfortunetly Purolator did not enter my right address, they've entered my PO box number instead of my house number. Got an email notification about this only on the next monday. I went to change the address right away. They told me that by wenesday my package will arrive. I was following my package online and it was going back and fourth from Ottawa to Montreal and Montreal back to Ottawa for unknown reason. I contacted them again as my package still wasn't delivered on the day they told me, only to find out my package has been damaged by them so they had to retaped it and send it the next day. The next day my package was still not send and they told me a new excuse. This time my package wasn't sent due to Covid-19 and it should be sent the next day. For the past week and half, I was waiting for my package, only for them to find excuses over excuses why my package haven't been sent yet. So frustrated by this situation."

"Recently, my shipment got returned to sender because the driver failed to leave a note or call me when he attempted to deliver my package.
Dave (employee# 0176) at the Moncton Shipping Centre provided excellent service in ensuring that this time around the package gets delivered successfully.
Professionalism, expertise and excellent service by Dave (#0176) made the entire process comfortable and a pleasant experience. 5 STARS to him!!!"
"To date this company has never delivered an item on time. This goes back before the pandemic. This has to be the worst shipping company on earth. Last time I ordered an item and the online company used them. They actually tried to deliver the item. I was home I answered the phone. by the time I went to my front door they already left.
Apparently they have to do so many deliveries a day so at the end of the day they just do quick GPS drop inns to show they tried to deliver an item. I was livid and then after that they lost my package and had to have it sent again!

This time I decided to buy a TV from Amazon and the 1st time they used puralator the item was lost and the birthday present was never given. I called amazon and they re sent the item last Thursday the tv was supposed to be delivered on monday. its now wednesday and there has been zero updates since thursday.

This company makes promises they cannot keep and it seems like they are being run by an office of chimps at keyboards just reiterating whats already available online.

call back tomorrow if its still not updated... yeah like i want to wait 1 hour for an operator to tell me the item is still lost.

I am going to read some glass ceiling reviews to see if working there is as bad as being a customer."

"They failed to deliver our package the third time. The first time, they just sent the item back. The second time I had to personally go and collect the item which was huge and had to take an Uber. The third one, they said could not deliver because we are on vacation... Seriously!!?? at this time when I'm stuck at home. We gave every contact and delivery information to place it at our doorstep. I never ever want to use Purolator ever and worst part is we got no choice in Amazon."

"On April 24 I had posted a review about terrible customer service. Three days later I received a call from someone at Purolator apologizing and saying my shipment would be delivered the next day, April 28. Well it’s now 7:pm on April 28 and again no delivery and no phone call. I don’t think I’ve ever had such terrible service and I intent to tell everyone I can not to use Purolator since they can’t be believed to follow through on their promises."

"Unbelievable. We were both home, the car was in the driveway and the delivery guy did not even bother to deliver our parcel to the house. We found a notice in the mailbox later saying that we need to pick up the parcel on the following day 30km away from here. Worst service ever. And this is during COVID-19 time and we both haven't left the house for five weeks. Because of this lazy driver we now have to? How bad can a service company be!!!"

"I ordered a package that was supposed to be here on Monday. The tracking slip said that it was delivered on Monday. It was not and before anyone can suggest that it was stolen, I have a camera over my front porch. No one came. I called purolator and spoke to their tracking specialist who said that the driver was in the area delivering packages. They parked up the road but never in front of my home. Because the GPS can place them there it was deemed delivered as no signature is required. They basically blamed the company that I bought my product at and told me to go pursue them and closed their investigation I’ve spent hours on the phone only to be told that I’m on my own.. It’s such a hassle.. I just want my product!"

"This delivery company makes no sense. My package was on tht truck since this morning. 12 hours later no delivery attempt made and an email update that I can pick it up at the counter. Why? The updates literally state on truck for delivery at sorting facility. I already have eliminated ordering from places because they use Purolator to deliver. Why is it that I never get my packages to my place ? I always have to go an hour by transit to the the other end of tht city??? Today was especially lovely as Purolator actually made it to my building, even my floor, except to do a Pick up from my neighbour. I asked the driver about my package..and how come he didn't have it? He explained a second driver would have it....in all my life I've never seen 2 Purolator truck deliveries on my street let alone my building. That was late after noon..so I already figured no delivery today. I don't understand this company at all. Your job is it pick up and deliver not just pick up and who knows what happens to packages and then decide to just have it at your facility. It's frustrating for people who have no control over what delivery service other companies use. All I know is I won't be ordering from where I did because this is the outcome. And this is the second time this year this has happened. Last time the person on the help line couldn't even give me an answer as to where my package was.....you all need it reevaluate what you're doing...the other complaints are all to familiar. If -10 stars was an option I would have given that."

UPS, FeDEx, Canada Post are alL way way way better.

"Without exception, the various packages which have been sent to me using Purolator have always resulted in a delivery attempted note being left and me having to pickup my package at their facility. As I have no car off my own, this necessitates bumming a ride from a friend to pickup my packages. It is this always a frustration when I see that a company is shipping with Purolator.

I have had to particularly frustrating experiences with them. In the first, I was picking up a package and, as requested, provided photo ID. Unfortunately, my ID showed my previous address, so I was told that I had to show an official bill with my correct address. Thankfully, I was able after several minutes to produce a copy of my hydro bill from Hydro Quebec's website. During this time, the agent seemed very impatient with me, and refused to communicate with me in English, so I obliged and communicated as best in French and with all of the politeness I could. It seemed an extreme level of scrutiny.

The second occasion was that I had two packages being delivered on the same truck (per tracking details, they each left the facility at the same time).

One of these was a redelivery which, thankfully, the facility had contacted me to arrange. I left the delivery attempted ticket with my signature authorizing this and all other deliveries to be left without a signature. I had asked if the driver could call me upon arrival, as my buzzer does not function and other companies have done for me, but I was told that the drivers do not carry phones. This considered, I also propped open the lobby door to permit access to the building in case the driver did not notice the slip I had left.

The driver left this package and took the signature not required slip, but did not feeling the second package and instead left a delivery attempted slip.

I suppose I will now fill this one out, and hope that I can get through to have a redelivery attempt made, because I cannot legally ride with a friend to pickup the package as we are under stay at home orders in Quebec.

Please, please, please contact your superiors and relay that no other delivery company is this particular about signature requirements. Every other courrier, FedEx, Canada Post, Intelcom Express, and UPS have managed to contact me or to deliver my packages. Purolator is the sole company with whom I have had this level of frustration."

After reading so many bad reviews I was determined to not let the delivery driver get away without delivering my parcel. Got the email saying shipment is on the way at 8.30 am. Waited outside the door until the delivery guy came at 4.30 pm. Did work from outside the house. He stopped right Infront of the House and seemed like he has no intention to run away lol. Got my shipment on the spot the vehicle stopped. Everyone's happy 😁 Three stars because I purely attempted to get the shipment.
"Careless service. Didn't ring the buzzer. The company must be instructing employees to leave attempted delivery notices only, as I am seeing a plethora of bad reviews stating the same thing. I have recently had deliveries made by FedEx and Canada Post and each company rang my buzzer and helped assist me with heavy packages to my apartment door. In the case of Purolator however they just left an attempted delivery slip and drove away with a full truck of parcels back to the pickup facility. Which is weird because Ontario declared a state of emergency meaning breaking stay-at-home orders for anything other than groceries or pharmaceuticals is against the law. Meaning that any Purolator victims leaving home to go to the pickup facility are subject to a $1000 fine if stopped by authorities and/or contracting Covid19 and dying or killing someone else. And this has happened to me in the past several times last year so using Covid19 as an excuse is unfounded. Because I don't drive I will have to pay an Uber to take me to and from the pickup facility costing me around 35$.

Hopefully Amazon with distance themselves from Purolator in response to consumer dissatisfaction. Otherwise, even Amazon risks losing business because of this company.

All I ask is for Purolator to define was constitutes an attempted delivery and then pair their definition with the complaints logged on this website."

I'm constantly sending stuff from Ontario to BC. Packages have always been delivered the next day. Never an issue in the past 5 years.
"Same with everyone as what happened to me today: ""Attempted delivery - receiver unavailable, left message"". Seriously? I was in our apartment the WHOLE day and was waiting for their call. They already came inside the apartment but instead of calling or knocking on my door, they just left the tag in my mailbox in the ground floor! I am now worried because I have 3 more packages from Michaels and they are using Purolator! I need the item this week and it will be redelivered on Monday! Which is not my fault, the customer service (chat) Lori C. was too cold to talk too like I was talking to a robot and suggested me to just pick it up if I need the package. I don't have a car and if I have a car why would I choose the item to be shipped if I can just pick it up at Michaels which is the same area as Purolator's pickup centre and pay for a shipping fee? Fedex and UPS are better but I don't have a choice because Michaels are using them. Purolator should think of making it better or you will lose customers."

"Same experience as many others. I was home all day, yet somehow they managed to sneak up and put a ""sorry we missed you slip"" on my door. They should work for CSIS if they're that sneaky. Now the tracking status is as follows:
-on vehicle for delivery
-attempted delivery - receiver unavailable (with instructions to pick up)
-on vehicle for delivery (with accompanying text message)
-shipment available for pickup

Is it out for delivery again? Should I go and pick it up... who knows. I will not deal with any other online retailers that use Purolator"
"Absolutely worst courier company. Driver doesnt even Attempt to deliver package. This is not the first time I might add. Their office staff in London, On is great. The ladies at the desk have to endure this because of poor management and horrible drivers. Called Amazon and told them I would never do any business with them again if purolator is the courier. Did the same with Dyson Canada. Best of all is you put this complains on Purolator;s website and contact relations and you never hear back from them LOL. Hope you guys go bust. Well deserved

Edit. Thanks for your reply and I do feel for people in your position because you have to endure the incompetence of management and drivers. I encourage everyone reading these reviews to call up your online retailers and refuse to do business with them if Purolator is the delivery method. Only then this company will listen up and do something about it!!!"

"ordered something from bestbuy,estimated delivery was suppose to be April 22nd, they tried to deliver it early, to then bring it back to facility without contacting me in any way(email,phone). Contacted them to just schedule a pick up instead and they keep giving me the run around. They say my package will be available on the 20th to pick up, and that they will contact me when its ready for pick up and still haven't contacted me. Now im trying to find out where my package is, i've been in contact with many agents and all they tell me is wait for it to update in the tracking info... Literally no help at all, it just feels like they are using the same term over and over again,""sorry we can't tell you anything about your package, trust the tracking info and wait for it to be updated..."".

"I hate that Amazon uses Purolator to have their stuff delivered. I understand we are in a pandemic and I sympathize with that I really do. That being said I reached out to them to ask if my package would be delivered today as per what my amazon tracking says and they told me they could not find the order associated with my tracking number. All the other companies that deliver for Amazon are amazing and drop the package at our door aside from Purolator. Even if we leave a note at the entrance.
The times they do deliver it is always left at another apartment door, left in the lobby etc. The last package we had delivered from Amazon with Purolator said it was delivered, we never got it so we finally had to contact amazon for a refund."

Puralator is the only shipping company in Canada not leaving things at apartment doors. No attempt to call.

Tracked my package said it would arrive Thursday instead it showed up Wednesday. Even though I asked to pick it up and have notification they did nothing. Was not at my business Thursday when they tried to deliver no notification again. Thursday evening it was sent back to shipper collect. Went to Depot and asked why it was not held for 5 days they said warehouse was full no room. I now have to pay all shipping costs plus still have to pay for it to be shipped again.

Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this incident.All shipments that are addressed to a company that is currently closed due to the pandemic will be returned to the sender. The delay in which this will be done depends on the current volumes at the depot.

"Puralator or 'package way later' as I like to call them are the worst delivery service in the world. It takes forever to hear anything worth knowing about your package, they never deliver it to the right place, they lie about where it's been and they charge an arm and a leg. They should be shut down... Bunch of bloody con artists."

"I had a bad review up but... I took it down. They got my package to me on a good timing basis. If you're snobby like I was, it means you are impatient. Just be patient, itll come! Thanks purolator got my xbox today ! :))))"
"Worst experience ever. I was expecting my order to be delivered day before yesterday but got an email today saying the shipment was delivered at the front door. But nothing at the front door.
I never received my shipment. This is so annoying. Spending so much money and realizing its all gonna go to waste because of this ridiculous delivery service.
Now, after reading all the reviews i wonder how is this company even in business."

"Said my package was delivered, nothing ever arrived, horrible.

Amazons issuing a replacement but wont have new stock for 2 months, so now I've spent $$ on something I won't get for months.

Thanks purolator

Edit: purlators reply below is a blatant lie, the package was never delivered, i have a dog that sleeps in a crate near the front door of the apartment that would have heard knocking and barked, the GPS on the tracking shows it was delivered to a reception in guelph, my apartment has no reception, and i live in waterloo."

"Complete joke.

Package didnt get delivered because the driver ""saw dog poop"" on my lawn. He didnt call, or knock or anything. Saw the poop and left.

It is spring and the snow melted leaving behind dog poop...

I couldnt help but laugh at the woman on the phone when she told me I had to pick up my parcel. You really dont deliver to folks with dogs? Wouldnt that remove half of your client base?

Pathetic."
"Hello, thanks for the review. I can see why this would be an issue if the path to your door is not ""clear"".

Terrible service."
"Hi Alexandria, thanks for the feedback. Please note that we don't decide when the item is given to us. The shipper creates the label then hand it over when it's ready. I strongly suggest you contact the shipper directly for more details. As as soon we'll have it the status will be updated to Picked up by Purolator and you'll be able to track it on our site. Cheers.

"Terrible service, first they have a “mechanical problem) which delays my package for another day, and THEN they for some reason couldn’t find the same address they have been delivering to for 2 months. When I offered to pick up today at there depot they told me I would not be able to pick it up till Monday (4 days from now) or it can be re delivered Monday. What kind of service is this? I don’t know why anyone continues to use them as a delivery method. The auto parts store I buy from just lost over 3K in sales BECAUSE of purolator. Congratulations"

"I ordered an item from Amazon. I left delivery instructions saying ""call on delivery, buzzer not working"".

The day of delivery I was waiting all day. Then sure enough, it was marked as undeliverable. I did not recieved a call.

I spent half an hour on hold waiting to talk to a person, who told me they don't give drivers phones and they don't call people.

I worked as an Amazon delivery driver. They always called if they couldn't leave the package safely. Purolator should not be doing deliveries.

**Edit - Do you see the response from Purolator? It's just a repeat of what I said in my review. They don't give drivers cell phones.. LOL. Everyone working here is a robot.

When my package was delivered to the pick up center, they didn't let me know. I had to contact the Amazon seller to find out where it went and when it was available.

The lady at the pick up counter told me Purolator uses independent contractors to do the deliveries... So, the drivers could use their cell phone to call me, and write it off on their taxes!! This company is absolutely the worst.

The drivers are lazy and their is no accountability. They don't care about the customer or about delivering packages. They just want to finish their route as fast as possible and get their paycheck for completing it, regardless of how many deliveries actually get to customers. Avoid at all costs"
"Hi Justin,

I am sorry to hear that your buzzer code is not working. Unfortunately our drivers are not equipped with phones to be able to call at the time of delivery.

"Rude staff, closing the chat window after asking where my package is. Next day delivery they where able to loose the package and when asked they closed chat window, phone. Almost impossible to speak with them.

"After having chosen the express option I spent the day waiting for my package.
When I heard the Purolator truck park in front of the row of condos where I live I literally stepped outside and started waiving at him. He choose to ignore me, drive off and put an incomplete adress as the reason he did not make his delivery. After review, they seem to have omitted to include the apartement number (a, b, or c) but seriously!? He was in the right parking lot, at the right address with a guy waiving at him and he just chose to drive off! Great service guys. Spent an hour on hold to be told they'd have to reschedule delivery another day."

My Parcel was left on my doorstep in the pouring rain and not in any type of protective bag. The delivery man did not knock on the door or ring the doorbell to let us know the parcel had arrived. Both of our vehicles were in the driveway and we had been home all day. I did not discover the parcel until the following morning in which case the contents of the cardboard box were soaked. Very disappointed with the service I received.

"god why do i even need to give them 1 star - this company and their service sucks - 6 days to overnite a envelope from regina sk to langley bc - attitude of all service representatives sucks and they do not care.

called them at 1:00 pm after doing a track as my envelope never showed up and they informed me that they had no way to contact driver to deliver it and it had to be returned to their depot to have a new address label put on it??

the address they admitted was correct - the drive just could not figure it out??

now i know why i use fedex and should have asked the sending parting to do so - will make sure never to use them or never have another party use them

spent over 45 minutes on hold for their lack of customer service - why these guys are still in business mystifies me??"

"How does Purolator stay in business? Who is in his right mind would chose to ship via Purolator? Unfortunately, whenever I order online no one makes it clear which courier company they use, and whenever I learn it is Purolator, I know the shipment is not going to get to me on time.

"Ordered item on amazon and paid for expedited delivery. Item was shipped via Purolator and tracking showed it was on vehicle for delivery as of 10:29am today.

Though I made a note including buzz number (on order), I called Purolator customer service around 10am to affirm they had the buzz number. I spoke to a courteous rep who got my buzz number and confirmed it had been sent to the driver.

I waited patiently for delivery, saw a Purulator truck drive out of my street and later got email notification: ""unable to deliver because it's heavy weight and requires assistance of receiver"".

There was no delivery note on the door to show attempted delivery. This is very disappointing and I just noticed that they're a couple of similar reviews on this platform and management of Purolator need to take steps to fix this."

"So I bought 1 item and they were “unable to find my house” the first time they tried to deliver and said I made an address mistake. I did not. I email them and it takes 2-3 days to respond saying please give us instructions so I do so specifying that I am in a laneway, but there’s a mail box at the front. They try delivering again, but they come to the BACK of my house trying to deliver to me when I specifically said the front because the gate has a lock on it and no mailbox at the back. They were trying to get me to come to their facility which was far for me as I can’t drive and due to this current pandemic, I didn’t really want to go. I said in an email again that I need this delivered and to PLEASE read my instructions properly. Finally, they deliver it BUT the package was dirty and looked like someone ran over it with their truck. I just wanted a small package delivered to me. Not impressed."

"Had a delivery scheduled for today. Contacted customer support at 11:20am to have them pass on my buzzer code to the driver. At 12:20pm on I decided to check the status and noticed the driver left 20 minutes ago after not delivering the package citing ""no buzzer code"".

I contact customer support again, and got a bunch of BS thrown at me. Then I was told I could either pick it up myself tomorrow or wait for another delivery attempt the day after. I spoke to separate agents, both refused to send the driver back and basically told me too bad.

If you're shipping something. Please use another delivery service. Purolator is complete trash."

"I always dread when I order something online and I see the shipper is Purolator. I can honestly say that in the 4 years I have lived at my apartment, I have never successfully received a package. I ALWAYS get a notice, despite the fact that I am home all day...because I work from home. It's incredibly frustrating, not to mention time consuming to either have to call customer service or go pick up the package myself. They never attempt a second delivery either.

"Every single package that is delivered by Purolator goes wrong and I dread it (I am ordering through Amazon).

1. I never get a notice that an attempt of delivery was made. I end up seeing an email from Amazon. I was home all day! No attempt was made. One time, I took the day off to receive a huge delivery and not a single attempt was made. I ended up getting the package after the 3rd attempt and after being home all 3 times.

2. Sometimes you're lucky and get a customer service rep that is courteous. Most times, they are rude and cut you off when you explain the situation.

3. This just happened today where I had a stranger call my cell phone as she was notified by email that a package she was to receive was apparently delivered and signed by me. She came to my building looking for her package, and we both figured out that Purolator provided my full name and full address to another person who was also expecting a package and accidentally sent that info to the other person.

Purolator, my biggest concern right now is that you are providing my private information to complete strangers. How can your staff be so careless and make such a huge privacy error?

Please don't tell me to provide a tracking number and that you'd be happy to resolve the matter."
"Hello Kristina,

I apologize that your information was provided to another customer. I am unsure of how this would happen without the customer providing us with a tracking number that contained your details.

"Purolator services are a pure disaster.
1- I supposed to get a package from a bank. Bank gave my full address but Purolator got it wrong without my unit number
2- I notice this on the tracking page so I called and supposedly correct this. But I never saw the correction on the tracking page. 3- not taking chance I called them asked to leave it so I pick it up from their facility. They confirmed this change again.4- with all that ....again... I got a message that it is on way on the truck to be delivered to me. 5- I called reminding them I want to pick it up myself from the facility they said they are going to inform the truck 6- god knows what will happen with this package, I am sure the truck will try to deliver it to me and my full address never communicated to anywhere....."

"No delivery attempt was made but I got this lovely sticker telling me I need to go pick up my package. I paid for the item to be delivered to my DOOR. Not 45min away. Customer service told me my option was to wait by the door or it'll be returned to sender. I was told no additional delivery attempt would be made because it's not an ""emergency"" Well... can someone give me an example of an ""emergency"" MAIL delivery??? I would love to hear it.

So basically I don't get my package because the delivery driver didn't do his job. Customer service couldn't care less. And now I have to wait over 5 business days for the item to return to sender just to issue a refund. Purolater, DO BETTER."

This is the worst company ever! They refuse to go down our road to deliver packages. Continuously having problems with this company EVERY TIME! Then it gets listed as ‘delivery attempted’ on the tracking device....which isn’t possible if you don’t come down our driveway. When we call for information we are told we aren’t in a serviceable area. Say again? So we drive the 70km round trip to the purplator depot in our area to go get it just to be told it’s back on the truck...again. On the tracking website it says ‘carrier has contacted you to arrange the delivery’. NO THEY DIDN’T!! Ever! And guess what...still not here. Contacted the 1800 number and were told that they will have our local depot contact us...still waiting for the call.. and no package still! IF YOU CAN USE ANOTHER SHIPPING COMPANY. THIRD TINE HAVING SAME PROBLEM WITH THEM! Horrible company! Needs to shut down ASAP.
"They say they attempted delivery and then don't leave a pick up label. Then you call them and they say "" You was not at home !!!!"" We are at home, I checked website each 1 hour because I know this company they try to force you to pickup,

"They say they attempted delivery and then don't leave a pick up label. Then you call them and they say ""Due to attempted fraud, we don't do pick up"".

Well then how on earth should I get my stuff, LOL.

How they are still in business is beyond me!"

"Why does amazon continue to use Purolator? Worst delivery service ever, no one else seems to have disrupted service. Package was supposed to arrive Thursday but due to sorting error packing was set to arrive Friday, fast forward to Sunday I have no updates on my package, tracking doesn't update and there is no estimated time for when or if I will ever receive my package. And from past experiences, knowing Purolator delivery drivers, they won't even bother ringing the door bell, they'll just write me a slip saying that I will have to pick it up from them which is a super big inconvenience considering the nearest office is 30 minutes away"

Zero wasn’t an option. The worst delivery service ever.
"Hello Ian,

"Would give 0 stars I ordered a package on their express mail and the drivers have skipped my order without even try to buzz me or hand the package to our 24/7 concierge. I asked why this happened and the customer service agent said ""we have high volume""...... Are you serious I paid for express and you're telling me that my package isn't important enough to deliver. What a waste of money Purolator is what a trash company. This also isn't the first time this has happened so be warned 1) you will waste money if you order Express 2)drivers will skip your order for no good reason 3) don't waste your time with customer support they are nice but are no help whatsoever just more irretating then anything else. Moral of the story DON'T SHIP WITH PUROLATOR!!!"
"Hello,

We apologize for the delay on receiving your item and can understand this would be frustrating at this time. Please reach out to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. We can arrange another delivery to you and forward your concerns to the depots management. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"I’m not one to write a bad review but after my experience today and seeing all the similar experiences posted on here....
Received an attempted delivery notice without an actual attempt for delivery. Was watching out my window all day and no purolator truck. When I called customer service, I was told the soonest I could have my package out for redelivery is Monday (maybe) or I can pick it up Monday (maybe) though deliveries go until 8pm per the initial delivery notice. Also spoke to a manager and was told he’d page the driver to “ask” rather than tell them to deliver it today as promised. Meaning another 5 hours of waiting on a package that will probably still not come today. Tones of both customer rep and manager were non-apologetic and more “oh well, can’t do anything, too bad”.
I arranged for delivery today as I’m in the middle of a move and needed a specific item in there prior to moving, I don’t have a vehicle to pick up the shipment, and was avoiding having to go to a store to get the items I ordered because of the COVID-19 outbreak...
It was an amazon order and amazon was more than friendly and gave me genuine apologies for the inconvenience and for even having me on hold. Purolator on the other hand, not helpful, not friendly, zero actual customer service.
Will never use purolator and will request all future amazon orders are with another courier as I’ve never had issues with any other couriers."

"Only a Monopoly Protected by a Socialist Government Can Continue to Provide Non-Service This Bad! Look at the Universally Dismal Reviews for the Past 10 Years. Purolator, 91% owned by Canada Post. Company Slogan Should Be: ""Purolator: We Don't Deliver Anywhere"" or ""Have a Week to Waste, Ship with Us."" Remember the bread lines in the Soviet Union? That's Purolator's Business Model. ""Purolator: You Do the Work, We Collect the Cash."" But don't worry, one of Purolator's outsourced customer service experts will send you a pat non-productive answer about how sorry they are that they can't possibly do their job or complete the contract they were paid for, and pretend to care."

"I asked last Friday to change delivery address to my home as my office is now closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. I was told the delivery would be redirected and arrive on Monday. Fast forward I have been in touch on chat with them 4 more times to confirm they have my home address and buzzer code. Just now they have attempted to deliver to my office (the buzzer connects to my cell phone). Absolutely furious, I should not have to chase other people to do their jobs, I use UPS and Fedex for our office and never run into these issues. Going forward I will avoid ordering online from any service or retailer who uses Purolator. Incompetent and inept."

"I have been compelled (by the online shippers) to deal with this company for more than 2 years now. But, except for 1 or 2 instances, this company hasn't failed to exceed (in the -ve) my expectations. The delivery guys are always rude, shirk away from delivering anything a bit bigger than 2 ft long, slapping a delivery attempt notice on the door (even without attempting to deliver!). Customer support is almost useless.

I am not sure when will the online retailers stop using them or start asking better service standards from them."

I live in a small town. The Purolator delivery van comes once a day but at 10 a.m. when no one is home. They won't leave a package instead take it to the city and never try again. You then have to go pick up your package. Kinda a pain especially when they come everyday. Just leave it on the van for the next day! UPS will atleast try again the next day and come earlier if they missed you. Thanks Purolator for the information. I was not aware you could request another delivery try.
"Hello Keaton,

Thank you for this feedback. Not all shipments can automatically be left at the door. It depends on the service requested by their senders. Unlike other companies, we do not redeliver automatically because if the customers aren't home again, it would be a waste of natural resources. We would like the clients to contact us and request for another attempt. This way, it's certain that customers will be there to accept the parcels.

Please do not hesitate to email us the tracking number in the future.

"There is a recurring problem with this courier company that has not been addressed. The drivers seem to either be inefficient or do not understand how to run home deliveries, particularly in complexes with unit numbers that require dial in. Hence, they conclude the receiver is unavailable, while the receiver is patiently waiting inside for the parcel to arrive. Or are we expected to sit at the entrance till the driver arrives? This has happened at different instances, so bad that they almost lost my spouse’ passport with visa in one of the instances.

I wish I could rate them zero or a negative number."

"Like some reviewers said: zero star for this company. Its own customer rep said that my letter/envelope would be redelivered to my address on specific date, which I relied on and didn't go pick it up. When I called them as I didn't receive it on the date they said would redeliver to me, I wasted 1.5 hours, being put on hold, then disconnected and calling again, talking to the rep and her supervisor just to be bluntly told that they returned it back to the sender and I should deal with the sender myself and they can't do anything about it. This company's poor service wasted so much of my time and caused so much trouble on my side."

"So, this executive named Orchid is so so rude that she doesn’t even listen to the question of customers and would just behave ridiculous.

All, I wanted to ask about that if I’m again not at home tomorrow would I be picking the parcel from purolator’s office or they can call or email me? But this executive wasn’t ready to listen to me and was just so rude.


I am so sorry but for future I will keep in mind that whatever I’m ordering is not getting delivered by Purolator because first you do not contact the customer and secondly your executives don’t know how to tackle the problem or at least how to be a good listener."

"Was sent out a package to the wrong address by Rogers. Rogers then updated the shipping address and the package was picked up from a pickup point and was sent back to the depot for re-delivery. The redelivery never happened, Purolator did not even attempt to deliver it to the new address, but simply dumped my package back to another depot and now I have to go pick it up. There was no notice that I had to pickup the package either - I had to check online and find out that my package was sitting at the depot for 2 days without my knowledge. You are a SHIPPING COMPANY. You are OBLIGED to deliver people's packages whether your employees want to or not. This is terrible customer service, and in the future, if I had a choice, I would not choose Purolator at all with your poor work ethics.
What is the point of claiming that you are a shipping company if you do not deliver the packages? All you do is drive the package is the address, deliver and its done. Its a 2 step process (sometimes 3 in this case) how you can get something so simple wrong?? Heaven forbid you take that one extra step in doing your job right."

Wanted to work here but if you do better be perfect for 3 months. 2 days on road training instead of a week and 2nd day alone make a honest mistake own up to it right away after realizing the mistake and 3 days later fired for the mistake. (Put wrong gas in truck not regular. Hit the wrong button) Unfortunately had a manager who didn't seem to like me from day 1 for some reason. Wish I had one of the other 2 managers who were both nice guys that helped and talked to me more then my manager probably still there. 2 days training instead of the full week seems was hoping I would fail somehow
WHERES MY STUFF! WORST DELIVERY COMPANY! EVER! After they read this review someone who does not care will send an apologetic BLURB! asking me for my tracking number. WHAT FOR?! So I can hear the company crap spiel about how great this service is? I was supposed to have my order delivered by this night so I can get it ready for my trip tomorrow morning but guess what..? ITS NOT FRAKKING HERE! I waited all day for it and now I will leave for the States on business and the package will come and sit on my doorstep until someone decides to steal it because I will NOT BE HERE YOU FRAKKING STOOGES! It’s funny though that I received an email stating that there was a delay but my package would arrive by 9:00 Pm well how about that? Isn’t that a pip? Congratulations Purolator you failed! YOU FRAKKING FAILED! I will cancel my order with Amazon tonight I guess because I HAVE NO FRAKKING CHOICE! But this is the THIRD! THIRD TIME PUROLATOR HAS DONE THIS! I’m so FRAKKING ANGRY! Why does Amazon or any company for that matter trust in this unprofessional company. I order from amazon ALOT and two companies stand out for delivery and that’s INTELCOM and DYNAMAX and they just use minivans and SUVS not those ugly freeze boxes on wheels. To the driver/courier that was supposed to deliver my package I hope you get gut rot and KRAP yourself until your bits fall off and to the rest of the PUROLATOR employees I hate you all. PUROLATOR- Parcel Upon Rotation Of Later Arrival Time Or Ruined! That’s PUROLATOR folks!

"My parcel was supposed to be delivered to an Amazon locker in Surrey and 2 days after the expected delivery date, I saw this message on Purolator website:
Friday, 6 March
6:57 AM
Undeliverable - Person or Location unknown
LANGLEY, BC
The only information on my order is a pick-up location which is a gas station at crossroads. It did not give me the complete address of that gas station where Amazon set up the locker.
When I called Purolator, the ""customer service"" told me they did not have the address and they could not deliver the parcel to that locker which showed on my order. And the person said he needed that address which I did not have. Why this company accept a shipment they did not even get a complete address? And why the customer service person got an attitude that it was my fault I did not give an actual address? I simply picked an Amazon locker when I completed my order and I did not expect a carrier accepting a shipment without knowing the address!
And the best part, when the ""customer service"" kept asking me again and again about the address, I questioned why he was so rude as a customer service person? He hang up! That says a lot of their so called customer service.
Then I contacted Amazon and they said it was unlikely Purolator could deliver my parcel, and I refused to contact them myself again. So Amazon canceled that order for me. I also gave my feedback to Amazon not using Purolator in the future in order to keep their standard."

"Hello Samantha,

We are very sorry to hear about this incident. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know and will be reporting this to our depots management to review with our drivers in this area. Again, I truly apologize for this. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Absolutely horrible poor service, they don’t update you till after the fact. There were no delivery options, or a box for instructions. The biggest issue is they don’t have a delivery time. How am I supposed to work around my school schedule, to be home for time of pickup if there’s not delivery time, and they don’t notify me it’s out for delivery until after they’ve “attempted” to deliver it. Absolutely ridiculous"
"Hello Bryce,

If you need any help with your delivery please reach out to us. We are available by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"I live part time in Alberta in a small town. Other couriers have no issues delivering to our address and on time. Purolator has never delivered on time and posts reasons for late delivery such as road outages and severe weather delays when there are no road outages or inclement weather of any kind. I'm convinced they view a rural delivery as an inconvenience and simply avoid it for as long as possible.

I'm currently in Toronto. It seems Purolator is no better here. They 'attempted delivery' while blatantly disregarding clear delivery instructions, then informed me to to travel to Etobicoke for pickup which I am unable to do within their 5 business day window.

In the future I will be requesting anyone shipping to me to use any option but Purolator."
"Hello Kjel.

I apologize for the issues you have experienced in both delivery locations. We are able to arrange another delivery for you. Please forward your tracking number to us by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"The experience I've had with Purolator in the past hasn't been great and it doesn't seem to have changed. At my old job our packages would come through Purolator damaged and I worked at the cellphone company. You can't be damaging those packages because a damaged phone would cost the cellphone company thousands of dollars. Now my current experience. I was supposed to get a package last week and it never arrived. I looked at the tracking and the address needed to be corrected. So I got it corrected and it would arrive the next day. Well still no package and again my address needed to be corrected. So I did and then realized the address that was put on there in the first place was wrong, that is not Purolator a problem, but with the 2 times I corrected it, it should be the right address. So I talked to them a third time to fully correct the address and the representative told me the address couldn't be changed due to restrictions from the sender, BS. Why didn't the other 2 reps tell me that, instead of wasting my time. None of the reps were helpful at all. No apologies for the frustrations that I have had. I have worked in customer service long enough to know what good customer service is. And when someone is having frustrations with your company you apologize and empathize with the. Though it may not be your fault you represent the company. So horrible."
"Hi Jennifer,

"Awful service. They say they “attempted to deliver” when they haven’t even been to your place, they say they “left a note” and there’s nothing at all. They say “incorrect address” even though I have no issues with any other delivery companies (I live in Downtown Vancouver not at the top of some inaccessible mountain!). They lie about not delivering because of “major weather event” LOL, how I love being lied to. This is the second time they fail to deliver my packages. I even called them to provide as much additional information as you probably could and still nothing. So I have to keep wasting my time calling them only for them to not bother. WORST DELIVERY COMPANY EVER. Amazon should seriously drop them. Terrible."

"THIS REVIEW IS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AMANDA IN NEW BRUNSWICK!
This lady is absolutely awesome. I was frustrated about a delivery that was messed up, and I didn't get. She completely understood, was compassionate and a joy to deal with.
I was very frustrated when I called, and all previous contact with Purolator, including their drivers, have been nothing but negative. Amanda left me feeling very positive at the end of the call, and the call was WONDERFUL!
Purolator needs more employee JUST LIKE HER!"
"Hello P H,

"They make one attempt to deliver packages to your home during hours in which most people are working followed up by a phone call expecting you to go to their business to retrieve your parcel. That isn’t going to happen Purolator, I pay for delivery, which means I’m not driving across the city for a pickup. Paying for a service from your business isn’t about your convenience but the customers."

"If Purolator had a business motto, it would be ""Delivering nothing... right to your door.""

This is absolutely, hands-down the WORST shipping service I've dealt with and, time and again, it never fails to be awful.

To be clear, I did not personally choose this service; The Bay, who I ordered an item from, did, and I honestly have no idea why they choose Purolator to make their deliveries. In the end, it just makes The Bay look awful, as well.

So... here was my most recent experience (but it's been reflective of other experiences in the past).

Last week, I purchased a (very expensive) picture frame as a gift, and had it delivered by Purolator, via The Bay.

When the frame arrived, it was in horrendous condition: the glass was shattered and the marble was cracked. To be fair, I have no way to verify whether The Bay sent it this way or if it was Purolator's sloppy handling of my item. Either way, it was not a good start.

I called, on Monday, for a replacement, and The Bay sent it ""next day"", again with Purolator. I asked The Bay, on the call, if a signature was required, and they didn't know (huh?!). But... okay.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to spend my entire day waiting, at home, for the arrival of my package, so I consistently monitored the shipment details online. Mid-day, I noticed there was an ""exception"" on the shipment, so I called Purolator immediately (as I was beseeched to do online).

The customer service agent advised me that a notice had been left on my door, that I would see once I arrived at home. Guess what? No notice! Nothing at all.

I called back, and was then offered a whole different story from a different agent and was *promised* that, although they wouldn't be able to deliver the package on Wednesday, it would 100% arrive on Thursday. If I was to go out, I could leave a ""Permission to Leave"" slip on my front door. Done and DONE.

It's now 6:00pm on Thursday, and I have no package. That's right. The employee at the depot ""forgot"" to load it. And how do I know this? Because I spent close to an hour (maybe more!) on the phone, hashing it out with various Purolator agents, throughout the course of the day. I wasted my time AND sat at home WAITING for a package that they couldn't figure out how to deliver. Isn't this their ONE JOB?!?

The Bay's decision to use Purolator for their deliveries is an odd choice, given that I've consistently found Purolator to be the worst of the lot (and, clearly, I'm not the only one, considering their fabulous record of one-star reviews...). If one is not home, and a signature is required, Purolator will not leave a notice for you (as was the case with me), and you'll be forced to follow up with them 100 times (as was *also* the case with me) to try and track down your package... or drive to their middle-of-nowhere depot to retrieve it.

My order was supposed to be an overnight delivery, arriving on Tuesday, and, when that didn't work out, Purolator ""guaranteed"" it would be re-delivered today (Thursday). Instead, it's been mishap after mishap and excuse after excuse.

Needless to say, I'm disgusted and, while I love to praise good service (and I do!), I always feel it necessary to advise others when service is subpar or, in this case, miserable.

If you need to ship something, I'd avoid Purolator like the plague. And, if The Bay wants happier customers, I'd recommend it consider a superior shipping service.

***

From hereon in, before I place ANY online order, I'll first be contacting the business to see which shipper they use, and, if they tell me it's Purolator, I'll let them know that, for this specific reason, I will not be placing my order."
"Hello JS,

We are truly sorry for the negative experience you have had with us and appreciate your feedback. If there is anything further we can assist you with please email us with your tracking number to customer.care@purolator.com. Thanks, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
Terrible company. The drivers are lazy and always claim that knowone is home but they don't even attempt delivery. I have literally say at my window and watched my front door waiting for my package to arrive and the tracking gets updated saying delivery has been attempted when in reality they didn't even drive by my damn house. Even when you call in they have no empathy and have terrible customer service. One of the worst company's out there. I guess they are unionized so why should the employees care?

"Thanks to one of the supervisors who works there, Denny, I mages to receive my package by the end of the day. I still think that it's a bit nonesensical that I had to call 3 times to find out what happened to it but Denny helped me and he's a kind guy."

Thank you for letting us know our supervisor was able to assist you. If you would like us to let his manager know please forward us your tracking number by email at customer.care@purolator.com. Have a great day! Thanks, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
I actually had no problem with this company. The item came on time and I found the delivery fellow very pleasant and professional. I am wondering whether all the bad reviews result from the fact that only those with negative experiences bother offering one.
"Hello Charles,

Thank you for taking the time to write this feedback. We're really glad to hear that you are satisfied with our services. If you still have the tracking number, it would be much appreciated if you can email it to us. We'll send a shout-out to the driver.

"I always dread whenever I order on Amazon, and see that they're using Purolator to deliver my package. I have always had bad experiences with them, but this one has been the worst. So I was expecting an important delivery Monday. Decided I'd work from home that day. No calls or knocks at all. I check my tracking id and see that my delivery was attempted. Ok, I go downstairs in my buildings lobby to search for a slip, and I find one inside the building, past the locked door. Ok, this means that he was able to gain access into my building, but was to lazy to come upstairs and knock on my door, or even call me to come downstairs to grab it. Great, the slip said my package would be available today after 6pm at one of their shipping centres that is 15kms away. Well now I drive around 25 minutes to their centre at around 7:30, the lady there can't find my package, she goes on a search for around an hour involving other people, and after an hour of waiting, I find out that the driver had left his truck locked without unloading his packages, had gone home, and no one has the keys to unlock his truck. Perfect, I tell them that I will return tomorrow and I specifically told them, and Customer support that I do not want my package
redelivered, as I would pick it up in person. Well, I go and track my package the following day, and see that my package is being redelivered. I find out that it is the exact same driver delivering my package, and that it far to late for them to reroute my package to my work address or a pick up location. So here's another day of not receiving my package. Thank you for the massive waste of time. I'm sure nothing will happen to the driver, and he will continue doing the absolute bare minimum. Hopefully Amazon integrates shipping preferences so I have to never use Purolator again."
"Hello Anon,

I am very sorry to read about your negative experience with us. Please reach out to us through email at customer.care@purolator.com so we can file this complaint with our drivers management. Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Worst company ever.
Didnt deliver my package when i was waiting for it. Said they couldn't access the building. Nobody ever notified me that the delivery guy is at the door. Every other company ive ever done (at least 10 companies) have given me a call when they arrived. Never expect your items to show up with this company."
"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to write this feedback. We're sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with us. Our delivery personnel is indeed required to ring or knock when they arrive to notify the customers. If the buzzer isn't in working order, they're unable to call because they don't carry company mobile phones. Please email us the tracking number and we can find alternative delivery solutions for you.

"Bought an item from Amazon hoping Intelcom will deliver it because so far they deliver all the time to my address without any issues.. Amazon decided to ship through Purolator. I'm at home, the intercom rang, cool answered and tried to open the door no reply... Another call on the intercom ... said hello but no one replied...2 minutes later ..""Delivery attempted"".. Really!!!!

I gave up, will start using local stores for my stuff even if I have to use Uber for that."
"Well as promised if anything changed I would keep all in the loop..
After several very bad deliveries I worte a review on the experience and was responded to by purolator. I was assured the problems I decribed would be investigated. And I thought no way they are just blowing smoke up there, and maybe they were and this is all just chance, but the last several deliveries have been on time and earlier in the day than usual. It hasnt been one but about 5 now that were as they should be.
If you guys did do something thank thanks I appreciate it. I doubt it was to do with me but whatever happened keep it up."
"if a label is created and 2 or 3 days goes by and the package is not picked up why would you not look into it ,,, instead i have to go and try to track it down if you can notify me when it move why cant your system notify you when it dose not move"
"Hello Phil,

Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this situation.

When a label is created, an entry automatically appears on the tracking. This does not mean that the sender requested a pickup or shipped the package, it only indicates that the label was printed. Some shippers wait several days before contacting us to request a pickup, they would wait for a skid or truck to be full before sending out their shipments.

If you'd like us to look into a specific shipment, please email us your tracking number.

"Their motto is ""It’s not a package. It’s a promise."" Well, it seems they are unable to keep their promises.

I work from home. I was here all day. So I plan my day after checking the tracking.

21 Feb 2020 08:27 On vehicle for delivery

Then I get this...
21 Feb 2020 12:56 Attempted delivery - issue with order
This is an outright lie. They did not attempt delivery. Then I get this.

21 Feb 2020 13:27 Out for Delivery
21 Feb 2020 17:56 Unable to Deliver

Their website says they deliver until 9 pm. The unable to deliver didn't show up on tracking until after 7 MST making it too late to do chat or call customer service. This is absolutely ridiculous. The package sat in Ontario for days and now this?

Update: 22/02/2020 - I emailed to customer service no response until this morning. The email stating ""They could see I chatted and the Depot will contact me.""

Update 24/02/2020 - I did the customer service chat this morning and was told by the automated system ""This shipment was refused by the receiver because of an order discrepancy or issue with the order."" Complete out right lies.

I then talked to a customer service agent via chat and got this response ""The depot will follow up with you on this."" 2 hours later still nothing.

I am being calm but I am so angry at being lied to.

Update 24/02/2020 - No contact from Purolator at all. They changed it to ""Duplicate Waybill""I called again, still, nothing and they said eBay would have to deal with the issue. I called eBay, they blamed the seller.

Update 26/02/2020 - Still no contact from Purolator. Status changed to delivery today. The eBay seller finally replied that she would ""look into it"". I received two packages, one was mine the box was trashed and one is someone else's that actually asked for a signature and they just dropped it on my porch and ran. Messaged the seller. eBay has lost my business. Purolator has lost my business and now I get to wait and see what to do with someone else's package."

"How are these people still in business? Just scroll through the reviews here, on Google, and elsewhere. 1 star, thousands of reviews. That tells you everything you need to know.

Amazon uses them. Why? I have no idea. Cheapness, probably.

Their drivers obviously don't have GPS--or can't use. They don't know what a buzzer is. And they don't carry phones. It's embarrassing."

"I had a package delivery scheduled for Friday. They came at 9:15AM. Didn’t knock the door, only left a notice. Now the package is not available until Monday, because they take it to a different city overnight.
When I called customer service, they weren’t helpful at all, just repeated there’s nothing that could be done. Pathetic."
"Hello Johnny,

"Simply the worst.

100% of the time I get late shipment from Amazon is because it is delivered by Purolator.

Each time I call them I have to wait a very long time. Also their callback service is a joke: yes they call back, but no one to speak to, complete silence for over 15 minutes then I give up.

Multiple time I ask them to NOT deliver because they are days late and the item is now useless to me. I get confirmation number for the request BUT they still leave the parcel at my front door...

They sometimes don't even bother to ring the bell and put their card on my door so I have to get my parcel the day after at some pickup place.

They NEVER got better, they were the worst years ago and they STILL are the worst. I don't understand how they can still operate."

They made me wait weeks for a delivery , each time I called they said tomorrow but this is just lie, finally upon tracking I noticed that they wrote as comment "" - unable to complete delivery due to heavyweight shipment"" what..?! Why did you accept and scanned the item at first place if you know that you won't even deliver to the client!

They put my package in the wrong truck for delivery and cannot figure out how to get it to me today. I'm moving and the only solution they could come up with was to deliver it next week when I'm not home to my new address (so the package can be returned I guess). So not impressed

"When you put something in the truck, can you please deliver it!

3 days! I have spent 3 days at home because it was said that it was now in the truck and about to arrive. 3 days that I had to tell my employer that I needed to be at home since it is a large electronic and I do not have a car so I cannot go to the shipping center if I miss the delivery.

I don't mind if you tell me that the item is not ready to ship, I will simply leave the house and wait another day. But stop telling me that it is ""On vehicle for delivery"" just to tell me
""Delivery rescheduled for the next business day""

Worst service I have ever had."

Another notice was sent to tell us the parcel would arrive on Tuesday 11. This morning, Thursday 13th, the parcel is still not here, and I found a notice in my email from Purolator. The have the audacity to ask me to travel across the city to gi pick it up at their main office. I had to call Amazon and complain.

"I followed my pkg with the tracking number & it was scheduled for delivered today. We live in an apartment & the driver did not attempt to ring our number to let my wife know he had a parcel for delivery. Just put a notice on the front door, & left. Yes, she was home all day. I looked at the noticed & it said i could pick it up this afternoon at 2.30 pm. Drove over to pick it & the fellow, oh no, he put the wrong date, on the slip.I wonder how many times he does that( !!!!! ) I said, okay what time do you open tomorrow, he said 9.00am. Okay i will be here at 9.00am, no no come at 3.00 pm. I had my thursday already planned for the day, Scratched that off for my day. Really ticked me off, when all he had to do was call & my wife & she could have gone to the door & picked it up. My suggestion is give me text on my phone to let me know an approx: time & i will be there and wait for the parcel. Can hardly wait for Amazon to deliver by Drone onto my balcony,or front door & save your drivers coming by an leaving a sticker on the front door. Just send me a text of where & when to pick it, but make sure you have it when i come, & for your sake don't give me a whole bunch of excuses. Either get with it or your going to be left behind & wonder what happened. Keith R Franks"

"There is no worse delivery service than Purolator.
After waiting 2 days for my cell phone, the first delay because of weather the second day because he never bothered to come to my address, he delivered it to one of their drop centers, but registered the delivery to an unknown address in my neighborhood, with a signature. Needless to say I thought the phone was stolen, went to this address, called customer service, and finally was told that the driver had eventually dropped it off at their center. All wrong information, and I waited for nothing.
I avoid them at all costs, but when you order something on line, you don't always know what service they'll be using, until it's too late."

"Purolator on Norman St (Lachine). Is full of incompetant and I suspect bias people. This is my 3rd time ordering something from Amazon, supposed to arrive Sunday, there was a snow storm and they claimed they couldn't deliver (even though I drive past their center to go to work). regardless after day2 I call and asked for the package to be kept at the shipping station, near lunch I get a notification that it's in transit???.
It's like they hear you, say ""yeah yeah yeah"" and just hang up and do nothing.
This is my absolute last time using Purolator, Canada Post takes longer but is def more reliable and doesn't Bs you when you call."

"I had a package ordered from Amazon. I asked that the package be delivered to the back door, due to parcel thieves stealing prior packages. Purolator left the package right at the front, so they clearly don't listen or care for their customers.
The only reason I buy from Amazon is because they let you choose where to leave your package, and leave screenshots. These were all delivered by Amazon
I noticed this package is delivered by Purolator, with no screenshot, and left at the front. *All I requested was you leave the damn package at the back* it's not a difficult request.

I get better delivery services from Uber eats drivers than Purolator."

"Today was not a good day for me regarding Purolator. I was awaiting a package with my passport. I am leaving tomorrow for my trip and I kept track of my package. The driver came to the house, he did not knock or ring the doorbell. I saw him through my window and ran down stairs to catch him but he was already in his truck. I ran out and tried to wave his attention bet he just drove off. He folded the delivery notice and stuffed it in my mailbox. I guess it was too hard to peel it and stick it to the door? Within 5 min, I called to complain and they said he would swing back and drop it off, but he never showed up. I waited all day and he was a no show. I was then told I would have to go to the purolator on upper james and pick it up myself. This is very disappointing, especially when it's an important document and its time sensitive."

Purolator is The worst currier company I ever see in my life . They said the driver delivered the parcel 2 days ago but he did not have buzzer number . But I know our front door was open I’m living in Apt . The door still is ope something wrong . Any way I call sender and they said to me you have to go and pick it up I call this company and the guy said parcel is not here it was yesterday . From yesterday to today afternoon no one call me I made maybe 20 call to now to sender and currier company Purolator and the currier company agent even the manager said we gone call you when we get conformation fron sender around 48h I’m waiting and the answer is very funny . The sender several time send them email phone and everything and still I’m waiting for their call . I never see like this in my life I’m 65 years old .

"I had a mattress, which I need to sleep on, out for delivery on a saturday, due to an address correction, it got delayed until the next tuesday. I work, as many of us do, so naturally I asked about a very simple request to deliver the package after 6 PM or on weekends. Customer service was very rude and essentially told me to find a way to be home on delivery day or to request a pickup (even though I'd clarified I don't own a vehicle, why would I be ordering a mattress online if I did?). Additionally, they apparently don't even deliver on weekends (what kind of courier company doesn't do that in 2020?) so I don't know why I was told the original delivery date would be on a saturday.

As this was an important item, I did, I took a day off work to receive it, and nothing, it got delayed until the next day because they 'couldn't find the unit number'. I called, and they verified they indeed DID have the unit number, and it was pushed until the next day, after using ANOTHER day off to receive it the next day AND calling that morning to make sure it was on the way, it also didn't arrive due to ""weather"" (even though it didn't even rain that day and I saw a couple of their trucks in the area throughout the day). I cancelled the order and asked for a refund

I couldn't keep putting work off like this so on thursday, I showed up to the office and of course, by mid day they were outside, calling me. With the package. That I got refunded yesterday.

I don't understand how a delivery services company in 2020 doesn't even know how to deal with the most common situation (people being at work on weekdays). This issue should have been solved from day one. I am deprioritizing this company on all my online delivery service subscriptions, I will not be using it ever again, and I'm at least really glad they wasted time and money on attempting a delivery on a cancelled order, just like they made me waste time and money by missing work to accommodate THEM."

This company is pure garbage.
We have accounts with vendors who delivers things to us all the time and at a high volume.
Vendors are using different shipping companies all the time.
All are successful at delivering things except this piece of junk company Purolator.

If it's too complicated for you then just don't do it, find something else to do."

Regardless... The packages were left at the door and nothing else. Not a knock, no ring of the doorbell, no signature, nadda. (Was pretty sure they required signatures)

Normally I wouldn't care, but with silver and gold? I mean, that strikes me as very odd. I don't feel secure ordering anything expensive that will use them."

I would honestly give 0 stars if possible. The company that shipped the package didn’t update my current address before shipping. I caught it myself and called both Purolator and the company. The lady I spoke to said she would put a hold on the movement of the package until I could get it sorted out with the company because only they could change the delivery address. Well I got all that sorted out by 7am checked the tracking and the package was never held and was actually out for delivery to the wrong address. I’m talking a completely different province. So I called them again they said they would page the driver and make sure the redirect went through and that I should receive it the next day. Well for a whole week it was held in the sorting facility in the wrong province. I called every day asking what the status was and why it was just sitting there they kept telling me the next day I will receive it. On Wednesday a lady I spoke to actually said you can’t see that it’s left but I can and it’s for sure on it’s way to you. Well she flat out lied because the next morning it was back out for delivery to the wrong address AGAIN. So again I have to call in and explain everything again. Well finally they straighten it out and it makes it’s way to the right province supposed to be delivered today. Now at the end of the day after waiting at home all day I get notified it’s being held for weather delays and that it will be delivered on Monday. This was supposed to be an overnight delivery and by the time I get it it will be almost 2 full weeks. I’m usually pretty patient and understanding that sometimes things happen but when it’s taking this long went it shouldn’t have it makes me so frustrated and annoyed.

"I wish I could give 0 stars.
Warning. Long post ahead.
We made an online purchase that was supposed to be delivered Jan 30th (yesterday). On the 29th, before bed, I checked the tracking numbers and Purolator claims they had ""attempted delivery"" on the 2 large items that day. Our items were a crib, and a crib mattress. For the mattress, the comment said they would attempt delivery again the following day (yesterday). They just left the crib at the pick up location. The pick up is less than a km away, but the point is, the crib does not fit in our cars-hence why we ordered it to be DELIVERED.
The mattress never made it's way to us yesterday either (now 2 days of staying home waiting for the driver who has never-and will never, show up).
I called Purolator and told them to resend it today. This will be the 3rd day we will be house bound waiting.
We live in a walk up apartment. We have NEVER had them actually deliver anything to bolus. We ALWAYS need to go pick it up. What is the point of DELIVERING?? We would have purchased in a store if this was going to be the case. I can't believe retail stores and Amazon still use Purolator as their shipping partner."

"Whenever I order something from amazon and see that Purolator will deliver it I KNOW I won't get it on time. So I don't have to stay at home that day! I just have to guess where is the furthest possible drop spot and buy a plane ticket to get there. But no worries, I know I have plenty of time.
How can they screw up every time? For years?"

Purolator is god awful. The drivers don't even attempt to deliver the package. I was at home today during the time that the delivery slip claimed that an attempt was made. Nobody knocked. Nobody rang the doorbell. The driver simply slapped the notice on my door and left. This is unacceptable and incompetence at its finest.

"2 out of 3 deliveries by Purolator were not delivered to our 12 unit building. I was home. The buzzer goes to my phone. I got an email saying they could not deliver. No card was left at the door. Clearly their drivers do not even try to deliver multiunit homes. They simply drive by and send an electronic message to force you to pick it up. 2 days of waiting completely wasted.

Without question, Canada's worst courrier service.

To be fair, the 3rd delivery was great. The driver arrived at my door with a hand cart and insisted in dropping the parcels at my unit door. During a snow storm. 5 stars for that employee. 0 stars for the others, hence a 1 star rating."

"Every single package I've gotten through Purolator has always just been left out in front of the door. Never in the mailbox or behind where the door would open. They also never knock, which I find a bit absurd personally. There is always someone home at my house, so you think they would knock. Specifically this one time, I received a call saying that they couldn't deliver my package, and I had to pick it up at one of their facilities, and this was during the afternoon where I knew that at least 5 people were home at the time. So I after work, I had to drive all the way down just to pick up a package that could've easily be delivered if they had knocked. I have a feeling that knocking on the door, and leaving packages out in the open is a part of their duties. It's just frustrating to find out a package that you've been expecting has already been delivered while you're at home, and you find out when you're randomly checking on the current whereabouts of your package online, only to have it said that it delivered an hour ago. Their customer service line doesn't do much either. I've emailed them multiple times with this concern and frustrating and including all of the tracking numbers, and they've never gotten back to me."

"I Ordered 2 items in my order from amazon for the same delivery address ( not to forget I pay extra for prime membership). However amazon decided to deliver one package by themselves and other through Puralator. Amazon delivered my package by the promised date, puralator who promised to deliver the same date as amazon sent me an email saying DELIVERY ATTEMPTED. I called them right away so if the driver was around he could deliver but they said it was not possible for the driver to come. Then I checked my security cameras, and turns out driver never showed up at the time they said delivery attempted. I called them again and the other CSR could atleast accept their mistake and said driver had some issues and came back early. Today it’s 4th business day since their promised delivery date and still haven’t received the package, I am literally calling them everyday and they always come up with different excuses. I even went to their pickup location yesterday and but they denied me the package because it was at the delivery facility and they couldn’t reach there. One of the WORST service I encountered."

"Constant 'weather delay' messages when the weather is clear. Some light rain shouldn't stop a delivery. My package has been in my Vancouver since last week Thursday, and today is Monday. I stayed home to wait for the package and noticed the Purolator truck pull up at 3pm. No delivery attempt was made. After a while, I peek out again and the truck is gone. A few hours later and I receive the same 'weather delay' message. Are the drivers just driving around and not even attempting to deliver the packages? Purolator, get your act together."

"Ten days later still waiting for delivery of a package that was promised to arrive in one day at considerable expense.

It's not going to the moon! A mule could have delivered it faster. And I'm assuming that one day it will actually arrive. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic.

PLUS, hidden in their Terms and Conditions, is the line that they will not guarantee anything sent by Ground."

"Just throw my package in the trash instead. It would be faster.

There isn't a worse courier company in the developed world, and I expect there are some remote undiscovered tribes that have better service than Purolator. Shipments are not only late, Purolator has to gall to lie about it! ""Weather Delay"" when it's sunny outside? Just tell the truth! ""We suck, we're an anachronism that deserves to go bankrupt, and we are not prepared to compete with modern courier services"". At least I wouldn't be personally insulted if they said that! Or, the common lie of ""Delivery Attempted"" when my Nest cam shows not a single Purolator truck going by all day. Social media person responding to this review - your job means nothing if management above you is comfortable lying to customers.

I refuse to believe the company actually has a CEO. No one could willingly head an organzation this bad - it's impossible to imagine that level of shamelessness. The only plausible explanation is that the CEO is a double agent from a rival courier company, determined to take them down from the inside.

I wish Amazon gave me a choice about my package delivery when a competent courier wasn't available. If my choice was A: storage locker, or B: Purolator, I would choose the locker every time. If my choice was A: cancel order, or B: Purolator, I'd cancel every time. If my choice was A: incinerate the package, or B: Purolator, I would offer to light the match."
"place a mattress order Jan 19 2020, no deliver Jan 21 but came on Jan 22. Leave a notes in lobby, ask me to pick up. Then contact Amazon, said they come Jan 24. I am waiting for whole day, nobody came. Actually, the delivery was canceled by purolator, the excuse is due to weather condition, but it is sunny outside. Then delay to Jan 27.

"Worst courier service in a surreal way. Almost never try to deliver. In more than a few dozens of deliveries done by them, I can only remember three parcels being handed to me. Their drivers NEVER knock on your door or try to buzz in. All the times I was home, with the buzzer connects to my phone, I know it's their common practice to never even try to get to the recipients before leaving a slip. It makes one wonder whether they even have the packages in their truck, perhaps they only carry notice slips around. Even when they leave a notice for you to pick up, they consistently leave the wrong addresses to make you drive for 20 miles for nothing.

I even feel bad for the very rare species of drivers at Purolator who actually do their job to deliver parcels. It's not a few bad apples, it's a few good apples among a sea of rotten ones.

It's beyond the most basic human imagination why they can stay in business all these years. Other carriers do occasionally miss deliveries. When Purolator actually delivers, it's always a surprise. It's a testament of how incredibly toxic this company really is."

"I wish I could give 0 rating for Purlator, the worst courier serviced I've ever used. My Parcel was supposed to be delivered to me on Jan 15th, 2020. It's been over due for more than one week now. I've filed a compliant and got an investigation started. Everyday I have to call the customer service to trace my parcel and was told again and again by their tracing specialist that they've resolved the issue and the parcel will be sent to me on the day we talked, but it never got delivered. On every single day it's not got delivered as promised, the status shows weather delay. Come on, everyone living in Metro Vancouver knows the road condition in the past few days. All roads are clear, all schools are open and everybody is going to work as usual. and I got my other parcels from other courier services everyday on schedule. Only PUROLATOR broke their promise. The tracing specialist even told me she has sent a message to the the driver who is carrying my package and told him to make sure my parcel got delivered by the end of the day, otherwise leave it at the deport for me to go pick up on the second day. Guess what, no one listens to that, neither the drivers delivered my package, nor they leave it at the deport. The status show it's got on the vehicle for delivery everyday and at the end each day it's not delivered, the status shows weather delay, which we all know impossibly play a role in this matter. I keep calling the tracing specialist and the reply I got is there's nothing they can do further. they can only tell the driver deliver it as soon as possible or tell them leave it at the deport, which apparently now followed by any of their stuff at all. We paid money for this parcel to be delivered to me and now even the option to go pick it up myself is not available to me and I don't know if I can ever receive my parcel or not. I need this parcel for my Chinese festival party which was held Last Saturday and it all screwed up now. Do not ever use purolator to send something valuable or something you really need, because it could never get delivered and not traceable neither. Purolator has a slogan that we're not delivering packages, we're delivering promise. WHAT A HUGE JOKE!!!"

"They don't even deserve this single star rating, I will never ship with this company again.

I've had 3 now they have ""attempted to deliver"" but haven't EVER gone through our subdivision. When they attempt to deliver, they're suppose to leave a door knocker.. however when I'm home, gate is open, no new tracks in the snow.. it's easy to see there hasn't been an attempt.

Specifically in Spring Lake, AB

I've called and complained, I have multiple reference numbers but nothing changes.

"Had a one-day shipping slated to arrive on a Monday, yesterday during the time of my writing. It didn't arrive at the end of the day because of the ridiculous reasoning of weather or natural disaster delays. Yeah, no. It was only raining every so often and I'm still very much safe. I give them a benefit of a doubt and waited for it today. Once again, I was given the reason of weather/natural disasters. Wow. During that time, I had the time to actually buy what I was waiting for myself. No natural disasters was occurring during said purchase. If I had to do that, then what's the point of ordering online?

"If I could give less stars I would. Shipment was to arrive on the 13th of Jan, it’s now the 20th and the tracking says it went from Toronto to Vancouver then for some reason right past me to Edmonton (I live in Kamloops) it was weather delayed for two days there then finally made its way here and was out for delivery four days ago and now the tracking states two days of weather delay... it was +6 here today sunny with wet roads and similar on Friday when it was out for delivery then. A totally inept organization. I called and the person told me it went backwards from Calgary to Saskatchewan...so customer tracking is different from company tracking. I’d like to hear from customer service and they can explain this mess. Tracking #JFV250318328. I’ll be letting the company I purchased my item from (Crutchfield) that I can no longer support their business as long as they ship with Purolator, if this was the first time this happened I’d let it go but it’s been every time but it will be the last time."

Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this delayed shipment. The local terminal is dealing with several delays due to inclement weather from the past several days, which has impacted our pickup and delivery services in our area.

Your shipment is currently available for pickup and as per the scans, the terminal contacted you to let you know. If you need any further help, please email us directly.

"They've claimed twice now that the product is ""too heavy to deliver"". It's a TV stand. Figure it out."
"Hello Scott,

Thank you for your review. Shipments that are under the Heavyweight category can also be determined by their size, not only by their actual weight. Their delivery will then require 2 drivers for the safety of our staff and our clients. Can you please email us the tracking number and address? We'll look into it for you.

"Unfortunately I had to give one star which Purolator does not deserve. The worst possible shipping company. I have yet to receive shipment on time and when promised. Their tracking is not trustful. Every time they have some excuse. They just lost my package after two weeks of trying to deliver it. Terrible, horrible company. I am not accepting Purolator for any of my shipments."

"I have come to realise that Purolator doesn't deliver packages. They deliver pick up slips and don't even to ring the bell. Kind of defeats the purpose of home delivery. Especially sucky for those with mobility issues. The toll free ""customer service"" number is just a hold void, no one ever answers.
Don't use this company if you can avoid it."

"Horrible negligent morons. I live in a large apartment building. Package says delivered left at inner door. What gives this moron the right to leave someone’s property in a public space (inner door). I mean seriously are you that stupid that you can’t take the elevator up to the apartment but rather leave the package at the buzz entrance door for anyone to steal. The item cost should come out of their paychecks, would make them think twice before they just randomly leave packages in random places. Complete morons"

"worst customer service ever, i was suppose to receive an order today and the status was ""12:11 PM
Carrier has contacted you to arrange the delivery"" but they have not reached out, I had to reach out at 4:13 PM to a live chat agent and they REFUSED to contact me to arrange any delivery scheduling. Now it's the weekend and i have to wait until monday for most likely the same response until I have to personally go pick it up myself. Please either deliver the package or just LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO PICK IT UP!"

"Of the dozen or so times in the past two years the only time I didn't have to public transit 3 hours to the depot and back, it was $1000 item which required a signature. I was home, about ten steps from my door and they just left it on the steps. Package was stolen, product was back ordered and took 5 weeks for replacement to arrive. How does this company still exist? I would pay extra every single time for Amazon to NOT use Purolator, but they do not give an option. THIS COURIER DOES NOT DESERVE TO EXIST! Replace whatever management allows such incompetence and laziness from their drivers."

poor customer service. Have had a package sitting in their depot since Friday was expecting it the following Monday. Tracking Says depot must contact to arrange delivery now almost a week later no contact. Every customer service route I have taken online/phone/chat/email have made me feel inpatient or made no progress. A day or two is acceptable but a week with out contact is not and a poor reflection of customer service.

"Was worried after reading reviews that I was going to have an issue having my shipment delivered, and because my last order (from a different retailer) I did not receive any notice prior to it being delivered and came home to a notice that I had to go pick it up at their depot. Since I do not have a vehicle and the Purolator depot in Mtl is out of the way, this posed an issue. However, this time, I was home, I knew the package was coming. The driver was great and even made sure I could handle it when he passed it to me. :)"

Worst service. My shipment shows it was in delivery vehicle at 8:00 am and I had to wait at my house all day waiting for the delivery. There is no snow its just cold. End of the day they update it that they won't deliver because of the weather. This is not the first time but last time was not reason. I don't recommend them to anyone. Very messy company.
"The ordeal with Purolator PROMISE: Expected TV delivery: Dec 30, 2019 then rescheduled next business day for one reason or another, Understandable. Dec 31, 2019 waited for delivery the whole day, no update online or call. It was a business day for every one in Canada, Not for Purolator? Jan 2, 2020 called customer service and was passed along to agent who later called me and told me that they could not located the item so the shipment will be on Friday, Jan 3. So I went out and found a pick up note when I got home, I called and did the live chat and was informed the delivery would be on Monday, Jan 6. Monday, Jan 6, 2020 another stay at home day, Nothing came. Called and did live chat again, no resolution. Finally an agent called me around 8:20 pm at night and item would be shipped the next day."

"Packages are just never on time, or never show up at all. Ordered at the start of this month, was suppose to receive it today, got an update saying ""bad weather"" I look outside and sunny sky, I ask my friend who lives in the same spot as the collection point for Purolator, looks outside and guess what clear skies and roads. Saw a purolator truck pass by, my package wasn't on it but you know, bad weather was a factor for mine but not the rest. Company is a f****** joke and they should start switching management and fix their stuff, people pay for faster and more expensive shipping and we don't receive it on time. I can pardon a storm but not a sunny day. Guess the storm in B.C is why they can't deliver in N.B. Silly purolator, same country different province."
"Hi Marcus, thanks for the review. Our apologies for the delay. Unfortunately weather in another province can affect the operations in another. Trailers will be delayed in transit and the depot will receive a lot of freight at the same time, which creates a backlog. You will see this scanning if the weather is the cause of the delay. Whether it happened at the point or origin, while the freight was in transit or right in your area. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us.

"They lost my package for a week. When they found my package, they did not call me ahead of time for a large item delivery (tv) and just left a missed delivery piece of paper. I then requested a redelivery attempt that was never attempted. They still have not delivered my TV. How the hell is this possible? My package is shipping from mississauga to mississauga. It didn't even change cities. It was shipped on Dec 29 and now it is Jan 13.

Never order ship with purolator. It costs the same as burning cash to heat your home. By the time your package comes you will probably have grand kids."

"I really dont know how this company stays in business. You can rely on them to be unreliable. And once more, as with the last 5 out of 6 packages, we have to go to the depot to pick it up.This time, it is the one 27 kilometers away (because that is where it was dispatched from) or wait until tomorrow for it to (maybe) delivered. These are time sensitive documents shipped Friday with a Saturday delivery requirement. Why is it not in the truck for delivery today?, you may ask. I have no answer for you, as they cannot tell me why.

I am advising vendors and delivery partners not to use Purolater when sending me anything. The one before this was from Amazon. I have asked the same of them, citing the fact that Purolater makes them look bad."

"Honestly the worse shipping company in Canada, i ordered 3 day express shipping and it took them 8 days to deliver. that's not an outlier, that's exactly what you can expect from your average purolator shipment. I order from the US to Canada and within Canada very frequently and for some reason its only ever Purolator that can't seem to get my packages to their destination on time. Their customer service is honestly laughable, they have no information whatsoever at their disposal and use only unhelpful canned responses. Stick with UPS or Canada Post, this unprofessional joke of a company need to go out of business already."

"This is the second time Purolator has failed to deliver my package, even though I was home all day and the buzzer to my apartment building is quite easy to ring. NO other delivery service I have used has ever had any trouble ringing the buzzer and delivering a package; only Purolator seems to gets confused, and only Purolator seems to have a problem. It seems that Purolator is really a “pick up” service rather than a “delivery” service. Extremely disappointed."

Worst courier service ever! They never contact you and leave the stupid message at the door for you to pick up!! I have repeatedly asked them to buzz me and they simply don't! No coordination between the 1-800 number and the local delivery center. I was assured that my package will be delivered the following day by the 1-800 number and the local store told me that they were not updated the next day! Stay away from Purolator.

I skipped work and stayed home for whole day yesterday with my phone beside me for their call and they had the buzz number and everything, and then I receive a note at the end of the day that I was not available and they left me the pickup instructions.

"I will never use Puralator again!!! Worst customer service. Shipped a package 2 months ago for one day service, which was actually 2 day delivery. Cancelled the shipment next morning and was to be returned to depot I had sent from and I would be called when it arrived. No phone call for a week, so I call and was told receiver refused and it was in transit to shipper. I explained I had canceled and was told I would get a call when it arrived at depot. No phone call, so call again a week later. Now I’m told shipper refused package, but I was the shipper and never got a call!!! Weeks go on dealing with the tracing department as now they are searching for my package. Tracing department finally says my package is lost and now make a claim. The following day, I get a call from the depot I shipped from and they say they located it, but unfortunately it was on route to Ontario by ground. Told it would be air freight back to Langley and would take 5-6 business days. 7 business days go by and no call, so I call and get told my package is still lost!!! Tracing department basically called me a liar, that the depot would not have called me and that I had to make a claim. So I make a claim and was told they would not pay because both shipper and receiver refused the package!!! I explain I, the shipper, never refused as I was never called to refuse. She than says she would look into it. The next day(today), I get a call from the depot I originally sent from, that my package arrived and ready for pick up!!! WOW!!! I did get it back but cost me $115 2 months of headaches dealing with the worst customer service"

"Not once has Purolator actually made an attempt to buzz my apartment number. The only reason they still have business is because Amazon still insists on using them.

"I sent a gift parcel to my niece in Italy (It was some used clothing from my granddaughter for my nieces daughter) no real value but put it down as $25. All gifts to Italy valued at less than 45 Euros are VAT and duty free. Purolators agents refused to deliver the parcel unless my niece paid a further 77 Euros and provided a Tax Code number. The parcel was returned to Canada and now DHL are asking for a further $18.08 for me to receive my own property back.
I have spoken to 2 Supervisors and 5 Customer Serrvice Reps at Purolator who have basically done nothing although one supervisor assured me that the parcel would be returned to me at no cost.
I have provided Purolator with both Purolator and DHL tracking numbers but this very poor company continue to do nothing

I was monitoring delivery from my in suite CCTV, they just made no attempts to do anything and left in less than 30 seconds before I have a chance to call Super. Phoned Customer Service immediately to see if they can contact driver to turn around. but clueless that no one can call the driver. Had to wait a great part of day only to waste my time and that driver does not phone (they have my #) customer if they had delivery issue. A pathetic company with obsolete operations.

"Dec 31st. Couldn't deliver because of bad weather.
It was 6 degrees and bright sun all day. Liars.

Jan 2nd. Couldn't deliver because of bad weather
The weather was fine. Above zero. Liars.

Jan 3rd. Attempted delivery, but no one home and didn't want to leave at door. I was home. Liars

Claimed I asked to have it not left at front door. Liars.

There was snow on my long driveway. NO VEHICLE TRACKS other then mine. NO FOOT PRINTS
other then mine.
A little snow on my sidewalk. NO FOOT PRINTS other then mine."

They seem to never deliver the packages you buy from Amazon on time. So frustrating. Does anyone know how I can reach out to Amazon and request that my packages are not handled my Purolator anymore?

"A straight truck backed into my driveway. I went out to find the driver at the back end of the truck. I told him I would move my car to better access the door as the box was 139 lbs. The driver told me he was dropping the box off the truck as I got in my car. He did literally drop the box off an approximate 5 foot drop. He then dragged the box to the hinge side of the door even though the door was propped open. He then walked to the back of his truck. I walked around the door and attempted to make my 97 lb. body drag the 139 lb. box. The driver turned around and saw me and made the most rediculous and disrespectful statement, ""that's pretty heavy, darlin'"". I informed him I needed to get it in the door. It must sit outside for the next 5 hours until I can get someone here to help. The driver walked away. If this product was broken by the driver's inability to do his job safely, the responsibility will be on Purolator. If there is another choice of delivery, use it."
"Hello Barb,

I am sorry to hear about this situation and can understand how this would be hard for you to move. This delivery should have been handled by two drivers. I would like to file this complaint with our depot if you can forward us your tracking number by email. Our email address is customer.care@purolator.com. Thanks, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"

"Tracking number never updated on Purolator website until after I received a missed delivery slip. Package was then sent to pickup location in a highly inaccessible area and when I contacted customer service to request it be sent to a more accessible one, I was told I would be charged a new delivery fee and that it would take 5-7 business days for package to be re-routed. Customer service agent was both rude and unhelpful."
"Hello Kate,

Thank you for this review. We're sorry that our services do not meet your expectation. If the new address or service point is not serviced by the same original terminal, additional fees may apply.

Ordered car suspension springs from Ebay ; fom usa ; i could track the shipment from Kentucky to Dieppe took 3 days. Then it was in the hands of Purolator for 9 days . Tracking said ; it was on truck for delivery a few times (?). And now they tell me I can pick it up. 65 km away ..... $58 U$ shipping in their pocket ...... This business is going out of business I hope !!! I will make sure everyone I deal with will avoid Purolator. THE WORST COMPANY EVER . DO NOT USE PUROLATOR!

"I paid $240 to ship a 2 pound box to Mexico. I paid the exorbitant fee under the impression this included the expertise of Purolator to get me my shipment by Christmas (I paid for the 5-day service). I went to Mexico for my Christmas vacation and forgot my phone at home and my friend shipped it to the real estate company I rented my home from. I was hoping to call my friends and family at Christmas so thought it was a good investment. Not only did I not receive the phone in time, when I did receive it I had to pay an additional $160 in import fees because the proper documentation was not completed. It was made clear at the shipping point why the package was being shipped and the contents. Furthermore when there was a delay beyond the 5-day guarantee I contacted Purolator. No one from Purolator contacted me with questions, I made the phone call and the agent agreed it should have been released. At this point I was asked again at that time what the shipment was and again explained it and was never asked to provide any documentation. My old phone cost me more than its value to ship to me and I still didn't receive it by Christmas."

"This is the absolute worst delivery service ever. I wonder why Best Buy uses them. They are the absolute worst and it's been like this for years. I decided to give them the benefit of a doubt and ordered a freezer on Dec 19th due to the Boxing day sale, Estimated delivery date was set for Dec 30th but they came on the 24th and I was at work. Delivery was rescheduled to Dec 31st and I took the day off work so I could meet them - of course that didn't happen due to bad weather. It was rescheduled to January 2nd and I took the day off again. I tracked my parcel by noon and saw a notification that they were unable to deliver due to ""heavyweight shipment"". What does that mean? I'm totally outraged - this is beyond despicable. The money I have lost so far is more than it cost me to get the freezer. I'm totally disgusted. Again, this has been going on for years and I doubt that anything will change."

"One of the worst company
usually didn't deliver with unprofessional reason (and if you ask them to let the person how will deliver your parcel call the answer always NO) and the driver didn't even care to dial the intercom and you have to pick your parcel by yourself from nearest location
what a very BAD Service as usual"

"Very Bad Service. They don't bother to do even a phone call. They are just horrible. I have had multiple bad experiences with purolator now. Whenever I make an order, I just pray to god that my carrier is not purolator.
Sometimes, I am confused that are they playing dumb or are they actually dumb. I can go on and on saying that they are the worst carrier service you can get. It is like the order was given to a child and he is just not able to do it ,so you yourself have to be very very clear. I have never had any issues with any of the other carriers."

"I am expecting a package today. It was a next day delivery and the driver couldn’t find my house. It is a simple google map search and the driver never bothered. It is New Year’s Eve so I suspect they just stopped working early. Supposedly my package is back at the depot. Supposedly it was on the truck all day. They are paid to deliver packages but then choose not to.

I realize people only leave bad reviews when packages are not delivered. Seems mistakes happen daily. Hopefully they have more successful deliveries than the many bad reviews I see in this site."

"I wish I could give negative stars to this company. First delivery attempt almost 100% failure even though I've always written correct address and waiting at home for the whole day. Why is that? Because they never made the attempt at all! Today something worse happened, I had 4 packages I purchased for New Year's Day, chose the next day delivery option when placing the order, and it's been 4 business days I've received nothing. 3 packages' Delivery Status show ""delayed delivery due to weather"" (Meanwhile I saw clear sky and Fedex and UPS delivery vans drove by smoothly) .I contacted their Live Chat Support asking if I can go pick up myself because their facility is close to where I live and I need those packages for tomorrow. Their answer is that they have to let the first delivery attempt happen (which is doomed to fail based on my experience) before arranging for pickup. This is the most ridiculous rule I've ever seen. The remaining package status shows it has stayed in a sort facility for 3 days w/o any update. Asked Live Chat agent if there's anything he/she can do to help me, the reply is ""sorry"". Tried to follow up with agent and he/she ended the conversation. Don't be sorry if you don't mean it! Improve your service, remove ridiculous delivery rule and truly care about your customers before you got beaten by competitors. So sad I cannot get gifts for New Year's Day. :("

"Everytime I deal with Purolator it's the same deal. Stay home waiting for shipment, driver runs to the door, slaps a note, runs away because he can't be bothered to take the box out of the truck. People pay to have stuff shipped to their door and not to have to go 1hr+ away to pick it up. I called the number calmly asking if the package could be delivered today and they told me Friday... 3 days later. I still have 0 faith they will ring the doorbell on Friday."

"ZERO stars for this company! As if they actually cared. ""We're sorry we missed you"". I just read their reviews? Same issues repeatedly. Lesson learned. Purolator tracking said it would deliver my package today Dec. 30. so I stayed home knowing they were coming. Well, Purolator came and left! They put a notice on my door ""We're sorry we missed you"" @13:25pm. Your package will be ready for pick up @ 800 Kipling ave. on Dec.31. The next day! Found this 20min after it was stuck on door. (was I expected to stand on the varanda and wait for his arrival!)
My mother and I were in the living room watching TV. My dog was also with us. My dog alerts us and barks relentlessly when someone knocks at the door. We live in a very small house, the living room is just steps from the door.
The Purolator driver did NOT knock on our door and did NOT call my cell!
The Purolator driver just slapped the notice on the door and took off!
Now I have to pay bus fare or get someone to waste their gas to drive me to get my package out in Etobicoke! I paid for shipping when I ordered my items. Was told that if I call this number 1888744123 they can have him come back and deliver it, but they gave me the run around. They said if i want I'll have to wait until after New Years to have it sent closer to me. --- Seriously, what is going on with this company. I'm so very upset."
"On a day that both FedEx and UPS made a delivery to our house, Purolator sent notice that they could not make it to our house due to a gate being locked or other obstacle. We live off a main highway with a paved driveway and there has never been a gate anywhere near here and there are no obstacles. It seems the driver simply does not want to make the delivery so after 3 days of promised delivery times and waiting for the for the package to show up, we are finally giving up and will have him leave it at a depot 1 hour drive away. I really wish sellers would give customers a choice to select a carrier. Purolator has to become more flexible for people who do not live in a city."

"Such a huge run around and disappointment in dealing with these guys. Shipped an Amazon.ca parcel Dec 11 for Prime 2 day. They never contacted me or the destination phone number. No email, no contact to Amazon either. Finally called and spoke to 3 people to clarify address. Promises, promises then the dark hole of no response. A little girl didn't get her Christmas present due to Purolator, and I spent quite a bit of time chasing them. I can tell the employees are just going through the motions and do not care.

They put two notices on my door, a weekend apart, one said I could pick up today (notice from Friday), one (from today) says I pick up tomorrow. It was supposed to be delivered last week. I took today off so I could pick it up and they tried to deliver it again instead of leaving it at the pick up spot like they said on Friday (today is Monday). It's Christmas eve tomorrow and I'll be lucky if I get my package by tomorrow. I phoned to ask why they left me a notice on Friday to pick it up and then tried to deliver it. I was in the shower when they showed up today. Either deliver it or leave it at the pick up location!!! Don't do both! My only consolation is that I didn't drive all the way to the other town to find out my package wasn't there."

"To be honest, I used to use Purolator with my clients but it seems I have to use a different option. They are late in shipments they appear to be apathetic. Customer service on the phone doesn't answer and hangs up after 20 minutes of being on hold (twice!) and as for their Chat support...I've seen more intelligence responses from AI's. In tracing their routing for a package (one of the few things that seems to be in order), A package from Mississauga to Toronto gets sent to a ""Sorting facility"" for an entire day(?!?) is routed to North York (?!?) and then drive back to Toronto? Where does that make any sense? And it is already about to be 2 days late and all the web chat people say is ""we do not guarantee delivery times"". Not entirely true: to do promise delivery dates and they used to do them. But it seems they have too much business that professionalism is no longer relevant to them. Suggest we all find alternatives (they exist) so they can get the messages. Perhaps a few lay-offs will drive the point home: don't ignore/disrespect the customers."

"The worst experience I ever had with a delivery services . I could not imagine more unprofessional and unknowledgeable service. I needed to send a parcel to Europe to kids fast . They said no problem we can deliver in three days . Charged me huge amount of money( much more than they quoted me on the phone ). A month later I’m receiving my package back . And it was suppose to be for Christmas . Apparently they don’t deliver personal items . On top of that I had to pay duties to get my own package back 🤬. ... now the kids didn’t get the costumes in time for the Xmas concert, I spend huge amount of time off of work to be on the phone with them( to list and relist every single item there was in this package. ) nobody ones told me that they don’t do it .
Now after all THE stress that I had with this package, I have to fight to get my money back . I’m shocked . Never ever in my life I will use Purolator services again ."

"I don't get how a company can be proud of a 1.1/5 star rating and not doing anything to improve. There have been problems with Purolator for YEARS and they still don't care enough to fix them.

If you dare try to contact Purolator's customer service, you're often given the most generic and useless responses. Look at Purolator's responses on this page as an example which all go along the lines of ""Sorry. Please forward us your tracking number by email to customer.care.at.purolator.com so that we can further look into it"" . We are complaining about your poor customer service and you tell us to contact customer service. The idiocy."
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I have to agree with many others on here, Amazon needs to stop dealing with this poor excuse of a company. Purolator? Ha, more like Maybe-Later.

My order was scheduled for delivery on Monday Dec 16th, there was a Maybe-Later truck outside my condo around 11 am, and I receive a failed delivery notice at 2:06 pm. Wonder how the delivery failed – given I have a 24/7 concierge, loading dock and all the means to allow for a successful delivery. Can’t be because the driver was useless, sat in their truck, and didn’t bother to lift the package because it weighed 75 pounds…..could it? Oh, might I also add that my concierge confirms Maybe-Later never attempted to make a delivery/contact them.

Good luck getting any kind of customer support from them either. I called to 1) open a case against the lazy driver who never even attempted to do their job, and 2) re-schedule my delivery. The agent I talked to assured me that my package would be delivered next day (Dec 17th) - but guess what, Maybe-Later now says they have high volumes and I won't be getting it until the 18th (If I'm lucky). How can any business continue to operate in today's world with employees who just don't seem to care, and deliver (about the only thing they do deliver mind you) such a poor customer service experience."

"The Worst Service and Experience Ever! My package is scheduled to be delivered on a Monday for a high value order that we ordered. I book the day off in preparation in receiving the shipment and to make sure that nothing was damaged from the shipping or from the provider. The whole day passed by until I got an updated at 8PM saying ""Address correction required - no entry code"". The unit number is clearly provided on the address AND the buttons on the lobby literally displays the unit numbers on the building so you can buzz the unit. This only tells me that the driver just checks the address and ASSUMES that there is an entry code. I had no problems with any other shipping company EXCEPT Purolator. I just wasted my time and believed that the company would the deliver my shipment as promised but there was NO CARE at all with my shipment. The purolator driver did not even GO to the building otherwise he wouldve see that there is no entry code that he rightly so believes. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR SHIPMENT NEEDS AND YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF DRIVING TO THE PLACE TO PICKUP YOUR SHIPMENT."

"Purolator is the worst company on this planet. Seriously. Amazon should stop working with them. Every time I need something delivered and it's Purolator, I know I'm going to have a bad experience. They apparently always have trouble accessing my building. Every other company doesn't. My buzz code is in the address on Amazon and every company is able to reach me and deliver my packages.

I've had to take an uber to a different side of town just to pick up a package in the past. What's the point of delivery then? You can't trust this company. They can't do the one thing their business is all about - delivery.

I have a time sensitive package that i really needed delivered today, but of course it was not because it was Purolator. Thanks for making my life harder. I have other things to worry about, but now I have to worry about this too."

Worse service. I’m blessed to have honest people around me. They kept calling me about my package so every time I called back and left a message to call me -they never did. Delivery person left a 400 dollar value package in between the lobby’s door WITHOUT IT BEING SIGNED. How about you dummies just leave a notice like Canada post does 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
"Hello Melanie,

Thank you for this feedback. We're sorry to hear that you were concerned about the delivery. If your shipment had the O-SNR (signature-not-required) service requested by the sender, we are then authorized to leave it unattended. But it should be left in front of your unit, not in the lobby.

"Never got my package, so I complained and they said they checked on their gps and the package was delivered to my door,they told me to try to get reinbursed by the seller,why should the seller be accountable for the money back when its purolator fault. They told me that signature is required for them to leave it at their depot.all the other company's leave a paper to pick it up at their depot.adding to this they claim to have delivered it so where is the proof? Purolator is the worst courier company I've ever felt with,I will never give them a penny of my money."

"I recently had Purolator ship a parcel for me. The contents was in a metal can, bubbled wrapped and boxed with packing tape to secure it. You can't get a more robust packaging. Value of contents was $200. A simple intra-province shipment that got damaged at their depot. Purolator claims it fell off the conveyor system. But the size of the parcel was 10"" X10"". So there should be a guard rail to prevent a parcel of that size from falling off of that size. I submitted a claim and they are refusing to pay. Obviously, Purolator has no accountability and no duty to do good quality work. Secondly, they failed to call the sender of the damage. This is an obvious sign they don't care. From now on use FEDEX or UPS or DHL. Way better service and accountability."

Not only did it not arrive Wednesday but now tracking says “delivery date not available”.... what????? Now it’s end of day Thursday and still no delivery date... I could have driven there, picked it up and returned home in 1 day. Yet Purolator can’t get it to me in days... if ever.... because I have joe way of knowing.

"I ordered a phone through Fido and it was supposed to be delivered by Purolator within 2 days. It has been over 10 days now. I have no idea where my phone is or when I am getting it. They supposedly attempted to deliver my package like a day after I ordered it but couldn't get in because they didn't have the buzzer code. So why didn't they bother to look up my name downstairs to find it on the list? And how come other packages that I ordered the same way, including another one through Fido, was able to arrive without any issues? This is not the first time this has happened to me with Purolator. Another example was, they attempted delivery and claimed nobody was home, which is a lie, I was at home whole time waiting for my package, plus I have a dog that barks the second someone knocks. I've contacted Fido serveral times and Purolator. Fido can't do anything because Purolator has my phone and they aren't shipping it out or responding.

So I had ordered a bed for my spare room and it was supposed to be delivered on Tuesday but it was delivered on Monday. I was not home at the time of delivery, the delivery guy/girl was kind enough to enter my side gate and leave it on my back deck so it wouldn’t be stolen. Anybody else would have left it on my front step. It actually warmed my heart to think someone cared enough about my purchase to protect it. I would love to wish that person a very Merry Christmas.

Wow you guys delivered my package from B.C in 2 days and ringed my door bell!
"Pathetic service. I have been waiting for a parcel since more than 10 days now.
At first when they came to deliver, they didn't have my buzzer code. So they guy didn't leave any note at the door. I was tracking it personally and got to know they don't have my buzzer number. So I gave them on Friday on phone. No delivery!
I went to pick it up on Saturday, they said that it is already on the mailing truck. No delivery on Saturday as well. I asked them to deliver at my address or nearest purolator but they have their center in Richmond so that is the address for pick up now.
Monday - I am expecting the delivery, at online tracking, I am asked to pick at their main location rather than the nearest one. I again gave them my buzzer code and confirmed the details and today again they updated the status that its ready to pick up like 12 KMs away... WTH!!!

"It should be zero.

""Unable to resolve address""
""Address correction required""
""Receiver contacted"" - Not true. Never contacted.
How many people have had this issue? I emailed Purolator several times and they keep telling me to contact the original sender. I did. It is the correct address. I'm not sure what the issue is but after reading with reviews it's probably because I live in a building with a buzz code. How hard is it to use one of these? Really? If they can drive I'm sure they can use one of those machines to match up the name.

"HOLY fricking useless people, spoke with 58 live chat agents + 4 reps on the phone and alll the time theres something wrong where they cant deliver my parcel. One time its the buzzcode, then the postal code. They probably pay their employee minimum wage, no wonder customer service is non existent. This is probably corporate and the managers being so useless. Or probably runned by a third party company. Ill be cancelling them each time i see them as shipping already, i cannot deal with them at all. Ive had a supervisor reach to me, and DO NOTHING. so useless.
EDIT: I asked over 14 agents on the day of MONDAY where my package was supposed to be delivered to have it delivered next monday. All of them confirmed that it was going to happen next monday. And guess what happened? Well I got next day.
I think there's a point system with this, where agents dont want to hurt their stats will not answer the inquiry at all or something like that. Because if 14 did the same thing then we have a real problem.
Knowing purolator, they will never change because corporate is like that.
FOR ANYONE READING, IF YOU USED AMAZON - ASK THEM TO de-favoritise PUROLATOR. Not Amazon's fault for this stupid mess this company has provided all of us.
Side note: live agent tells me that they dont have business phones while they are delivering. But when I got the parcel, guess what agent had in his hand.
2nd Edit: those media agents that respond to these rants dont mean anything."

"This is the worst of the available delivery services I have ever dealt with ... I live in the country and the nearest pick-up location is 40 minutes away with very limited hours of opening. I am disabled and cannot drive there (why I need to have things delivered!) and no one in my home can drive me there during their open hours. The last three parcels which were sent to me each was a bad experience. The next to last one was finding a valuable painting I had been left in a friends' will, sitting atop a fence post half way down my driveway.. it was dark and about to rain -- it was well packed but would have been destroyed. Most recently, I have called, used the ostensible ""live chat"" function (which is a virtual one that did not work so someone had to call me instead of putting a person on the chat). After the initial bad experience (not worth even describing) and the painting, I ordered something from a firm and it was not clear they used this company... 3 times a notice saying they had tried to deliver was found in the mailbox. First time I was sitting where I could see the driveway and saw a truck drive as far as the gate and back up and leave; after phoning and several calls with people at various levels, I was assured the package would be delivered the next day (although this took over an hour on top of the time on the ""virtual chat""); the drivers' handwriting was so fancy it was not possible to decipher some of the numbers in the tracking #. The next day, no tire tracks in the snow or footprints were seen when someone came home in the evening, but yet another ""pick up notice"" with a scrawled note which was unreadable and obviously meant for the manager. Several more calls.. and in each one, I told the long story, and asked by if a gate that I had mentioned in each all could not be opened by anyone, since a local 6 year old came to collect apples on our invitation and opened it with no problem. I mentioned the gate and the ease of opening each time but it was not until the last call from the driver's manager that after about 15 minutes of what is obviously what they are trained to say.. none of which was responsive to the issues in question, he FINALLY said ... oh our drivers are not permitted to open gates because 3 have been mauled by dogs. NICE TIME TO MENTION THIS. So I suggested that if the driver phoned me from the top of the drive and I knew what day they were coming and if a.m. or p.m. I would have the gate left open -- BUT THEY HAVE NO PHONES ""AS YET."" He had originally mentioned the driveway was long and the truck might get stuck in the snow, I mentioned that it is plowed by the person next door as soon as there is snow, but he said well they might need a tow truck.. and I asked, how they would get one without a phone. Some kind of old fashion CB radio /scanner type thing. I mentioned that as we were speaking there was a truck from Hyro (electric) company and a truck belonging to a tree surgeon in my drive and that thee is a turnaround at the bottom of the drive large enough for a fire truck to turn around, as required by law. I was enraged and did not hide it. I had already ordered something from France that is quite expensive and only found out it is coming through Purolator not DHL as I had thought. This ""manager"" was gong to text me his number after he called since I was being driven to a hospital appointment by a volunteer when we spoke and did not have pen and paper within reach. I never heard from him. My closing comment to him after all of his inept attempts to justify their drivers not having phones, etc. was then I guess I am not getting my shipment .... NO RESPONSE> So I am without the purchase that I should have had last Monday and needed by this past Friday, and trying to figure out how to deal with the soon to arrive international parcel. Sadly this means not being able to order things from several companies on whom I depend for some things, and am notifying them of the reason (but this does not resolve the issue that I will have to do without some essentials). FedEx, DHL, UPS and Canada Post all come to the door, some phone when they arrive at the top of the drive, and one sends pictures to my cell if they have left a small parcel in the mailbox or in a designated place. I will be pursuing this to the highest level and posting my comments on FaceBook and anywhere else I can."

Tuesday morning and guess what?? Out for delivery yippee cant wait... 6pm mechanical issues... repeat the process 6 days in a row and here I am, I tell you what my delivery driver must have either hightailed it to mexico with my package or they must be driving the worst car on the planet. As far as I'm concerned you pay someone to deliver packages and if they dont actually deliver packages what do they do?

"Purolator has screwed me on the last two deliveries I was supposed to get. The first one was attempted at my house. The driver left the door knocker with only the driver ID# and the location where I was supposed to pick it up. There was no tracking information nor a name for who the package belonged to. I waited the day before going to pick it up where they said it was dropped off. When I got there, there was no package for me. I called Purolator and first they told me it WAS delivered, it was just on my step. Ok. Fool me once. I went home and immediately checked. No package. Called back and they said it was actually dropped off at a different location. The lady told me to leave a note on my door with all of the information (they eventually gave me the correct tracking info) and the driver will leave the package at my door. I got home the next day, still no package. Look online for the tracking info, it didn't even make it on the truck! So I had to drive to their main depot to pick it up (which is not in a convenient location). The next delivery they were supposed to make, it says they had an error in the system and the package didn't get put on the truck, and the depot is closed - no option for pickup (too late on a Friday night). The next day (Saturday) it says it is on the truck being delivered. Wait all day. Check tracking every hour or so. Finally get updated that the driver was unable to deliver because there was some traffic issue preventing them from making it. AT ALL. Called the customer service number and told them just to leave it at the main depot and I will make the trek in two days to pick it up. They put it on a truck on Monday anyways. Try to deliver. I guess I should have checked the tracking info again on Monday. My fault. I get to the depot and they say they don't have it, and it was attempted delivery, there should be a door sticker on my door, and can I come back tomorrow! I am done with this company. Every order I place I will request not to send Purolator, even if I need to wait an extra day or two. Much better than dealing with this hassle all over again."

garbage service I ordered a monitor and speakers but only the speakers have been delivered even though they were coming from the same location at the same time. And even with that the courier didn’t ring the doorbell and just left a note with where I could pick up the speakers (I know he didn’t ring it as I was home all day and only found the note when my amazon delivery arrived with proper service). As well as this the monitor has yet to arrive at all even though they estimated it should’ve been well here by now then with their no weekend deliveries I have to wait till Monday while if I used amazon or another service it would’ve been here over a week ago.

Gets taken back to the depot due to sever weather. It was 15 degrees and sunny from the depot to the delivery address so this was a lie. Day 3 still waiting at the house. Have been told that It will not turn up today due to the heavy weight again. They have now told me that this package will not be delivered and that I need to drive to Richmond to collect it.

well this is whats happened to me, were i paid a premium for a government certificate to to shipped to me within 5 business days.
the letter was sent via Purolator within 2 business days.
unfortunately Purolator officer came and stuck a note even it was clearly marked to buzz once arrived, they didn't i requested to redeliver next day (they promised to do so) and next day comes they didn't show up,and their excuse was the driver had to go and recollect it from the facility they parked in the other day.
when they attempted to redeliver for the 2nd time, surprise, surprise ... no buzz, leave a note as last time. And when i called customer services they'll tell me that the delivery officer was there but no one was there to receive (how can you prove them otherwise!!??).
For what ever reason i would certainly not use Purolator again, or get anything from a service that uses Purolator."

"If only I could give zero stars.

The purpose of having things delivered to your home is convenience. Purolator, unfortunately, does not seem to understand that and will do everything in their power to make the experience as difficult for you as possible.

Let me paint you a picture. I recently had surgery and had to purchase a piece of equipment for my rehab. I ordered it to my home instead of going to buy one because I am currently immobile and can't leave my home, nevermind carry packages to and from a vehicle at a warehouse that is outside the city limits. I also live in an old building and the buzzer system doesn't work, so the purolator delivery staff are unable to enter my building. Canada Post has the same problem with deliveries, however, they follow the instructions I leave on the package to call my phone and I will let them in, it has never been an issue. Purolator refuses to make the slightest change to their procedures to allow for the regular convenience of having packages delivered to your doorstep.

Unfortunately, Purolator won't change. So that means I have to stop supporting any businesses that use Purolator."

"Horribly run and inconvenient. If you miss random delivery times without any fore warning or advance notice, you have to pick up your package in the middle of nowhere. It's 2019, but no weekend delivery options.
I will henceforth avoid any purchases that will be delivered via Purolator. Not worth the hassle."

"Purolator are a total joke. They did not attempt delivery when they said they did, instead updated tracking info with a claim that the address was incomplete - total garbage. A manager assured me that the package would be brought back later that day - it was not, then that would it would be brought early the next day - it was not and when I chased them again they had failed to even send it out!
Total. Waste. Of. Time."
"Hello Emmie,

"My first package was not delivered because they said my address didn't exist. I can assure you, it does. It actually has a large sign out front with our street address in Big Bold letters. When I called to ask what was going on, the CSR told me she was on google maps and couldn't find the sign. I explained that google maps was showing a photos from 2016, and that the sign had been put up last year. And even if, there is still a number on our building with the street number. I was basically called a liar.

My second package - I received notice that driver attempted delivery but no one was home. I work from home, all day, and my doorbell is linked to my cell phone. I figured this must have been a mistake, and called to ask they please attempt to deliver again the next day. The next day, the same thing happens. I called and they asked me to make sure my doorbell was working. It is. They said the delivery driver was trying but couldn't get it to work. I had a UPS delivery literally 30 minutes later and no issues. We had food delivered and the driver figured it out. I live in unit 7, so you press the button marked 7. It's not that hard. Why can't a delivery driver, who delivers parcels for a living, figure this out.

I think when its cold, snowy, streets are narrow, they just don't deliver."

"Same as everyone else, these guys are the worst. Package spends all day on the truck and they cancel at the end of delay claiming weather issues when it’s perfectly fine outside. Won’t even guarantee delivery the next day and give you a 13 hour delivery window as if you had nothing better to do than wait all day multiple days in a row on the off chance that they’ll actually show up."

"My Item has been on truck out for delivery since 9.29 am waited all day (sunny weather.) call tracking line 4.45 pm wait 20 min. while listening to the worst music I ever heard. No answer hang up and try online chat get told there could be delivery until 9 pm in some cases.
I live 20 min from Purolator Courier depot What takes all day to deliver 20 Minuets drive from depot ? Next thing I know i get email saying delay due the weather. What weather . look out side 6.30 pm.1/2 cm of snow on ground. What a joke. I guess Purolator will be shutting the doors untill May or June 2020 when there is no Snow . Get real this is Canada . I took pics. of the terrible debilitating weather that caused the courtier to run for cover. O by the way My UPS delivery came today on time . I guess this American Company Is better equipped to handle Canadian weather than PURO LATER the proper name For this crappy courier. Bottom line use some body else Best Buy these guys are screwing your customers. I will never buy online from You as long as PURO Later is moving the shipments.

"Hello Fred,

We are sorry that your item was delayed. Unfortunately previous weather causing a back log of freight and high volumes can cause this. If you need any further help you are welcome to email us at customer.care@purolator.com, Thank you, Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"The worst courier ever. Constant excuses to not deliver, ""bad weather"" when its perfectly fine out, cant find location yet i see the driver literally drive by my house while im outside chatting about these guys and what a joke they are with a friend.
Most times i have to drive 1 & 1/2 hr total to pick up my package at a main depot even tho there is one 20 minutes away, and usally always give me a hassel even tho I call ahead. And even on overnight freight ($50+) and LIVE ANIMAL packages which on the 3rd & 4th business day are yet to be delivered, and delayed from yet again some other BS excuse. Lies, lies & more lies, these guys give zero f***s about your package let alone actually delivering it on time.. they don't honor their delivery quotes/ time frames because they never intended to in the first place...
I Honestly cannot remember the last purolator package i received without an issue, delay or some kind of mishap/mistake, its so bad its literally become a running joke in our community over the last 3 years or so now. An utterly terrible service, with absolutely no customer service or responsibility for their conduct. would give 0 stars if i could..... DO NOT USE this company, they operate with little to no Honor or integrity."

"Absolutely terrible customer service, package was not delivered on time and when contacted the customer service department I was met with a very rude employee named Ron. He was very rude and unhelpful, would not ship me the package cause of what he described as incomplete delivery details even though he admitted the name, address, city and postal code were all correct, simply because the building name wasn't on there, even though my name and the address was correct. I've ordered several packages from other delivery services and this is only place the wouldn't deliver it with all these details. The rude customer service rep just kept repeating ""that's just the way it is"" and that I'll just have to wait.

Worst service I've ever received. Recommend never using this delivery service."

"I would rate them 0 star if there is such setting! I have ordered items from amazon and i guess is it the vendor to choose which delivery company. The package comes in 2 boxes, 1 is a mop and the other is baby floor matt- which is bigger but light. so the delivery driver is probably lazy since he dropped the small on and never delivered the baby play mat. I mean, if you made it in the building to drop off 1 of the package, why didnt you just do you actual job to drop off the other part of it?!!"

Purolator refuses to ever drop a shipment even one that's just $10 unless I'm there to sign. I'm at work all day so I'll never be there when they are. Then they leave a pickup notice that I have to drive 30 minutes to their pickup location with a 3 hour window on weekdays that I can actually pick it up. Can't even pick it up on weekends because they're closed. Then once I finally do get there they tell me it was shipped back because I didn't pick it up in time.

"This is just ridiculous!
The worst delivery service ever!

Ordered the delivery from Best Buy, scheduled it for Wednesday.
And they missed it!
Made a call to customer support to reschedule it to Friday, since I won't be able to meet courier on Thursday.
And guess what? Courier arrived on Thursday.
Called the customer support again, rescheduled to Friday again.
Did they arrive on Friday? no...
No the delivery is scheduled for Monday!!!
What the hell? This is not a service, this is a joke!
Hope the Best Buy will end the contract with them.
Will never use it again... and it's affecting Best Buy as well."

"I echo the experiences with every single person around here.

Purolator is the most incompetent delivery company that could possibly exist in the world.

The delivery drivers are incompetent, the customer service staff is incompetent.

I was tracking a package, and the status changed to ""on vehicle for delivery"".

All of a sudden, I tracked it again, and it said ""delayed due to weather conditions"".

It has been Sunny here.. all week.

I get that drivers are lazy don't want to do their jobs, but the fact that the drivers have no accountability is absolutely ridiculous given that they deliver packages which could be worth a lot of money, and people that are in need of their packages."

"140 main st
Thunder Bay, Ont
I placed an order online (amazon) and was given a tracking number for Purolator to have said package delivered to me on Monday, Nov 25/19. I was home all day that day, as the day went on I kept checking out my window as I live in a secure apartment building with no buzzer. Later that day I decided to go check the tracking it said it was delivered at 1:18pm except it wasn’t, there was no package and no slip or attempt to get in the building to leave at my door on the third floor. I had called Purolator the next day to inquire about my missing package. The lady said they needed to do a trace on the vehicle and driver, in the meantime I went to our local depot to see if maybe it ended up back there. Nope, the manager of the depot was completely arrogant and not sympathetic to the fact they lost my sons Christmas gifts (package), she told me I’d have to call and open a case file in which I had already done. Once I told the woman she got more rude and refused to help further. Told me to wait for the call, on Wednesday nov 27/19 the trace specialist was very kind and compassionate even went an extra step to contact the driver. Thursday nov 28/18 I received my last call from the trace specialist a different lady this time who was not at all nice she went on to state the driver is sticking to his story about leaving it at MY door. How can one leave a package at MY door when I live in a secure apartment building and live on the top floor. IMPOSSIBLE, they then pushed blame on amazon and told me it’s their issue. She also added in that the driver made one attempt when they are to make one attempt leave a notice and try again didn’t happen he simply just left them outside of my apartment building on a main road to boot!!! I do not and will not ever recommend Purolator for any delivery services."
"Hello,

We apologize that you did not received your shipment. We have reached out to you for the tracking number to file the complaint with our depots management. Thank you. Vanessa/Customer Care Team"
"Another terrible Purolator experience. With so many other options out there I struggle to grasp why vendors use Purolator at all.

Apparently the driver ""attempted"" delivery at 4:15 pm, but could not enter because there wasn't a buzzer code. There is a giant sign in my lobby that says buzz code is the unit number. No other service has an issue, except Purolator.

If he tried where is the delivery slip in my lobby? Not here.

The tracking was not updated until 9:30 pm, and before that, I had used the chat help feature twice to determine the issue, one time, at 4:30 pm I was asked to provide the buzzer code which I did.

1-day service was paid for and its clearly never worth it.

It appears they aren't even dropping this at a pick-up point, so I will be without my package, a replacement for my broken phone, until Monday.

Do not trust Purolator with important deliveries, they do not deliver."

"First of all 1star is write a review my rating for them is a MINUS MILLION AND MORE STARS.
They should shut down this company as they have a bunch of people with no basic common sense working there.
Even a novice would understand delivery address better than them .
Also very disrespectful and stubborn , when you call them they just don't want to agree to the fault and keeping talking things that don't make sense to irritate you.
I had a package to be delivered to my at my.work place since I am a single person and I know I will miss the delivery at home.
Every major courier company delivers with the same coordinates and only Purolator won't because they want a business name and a unit number does not suffice"
The worst delivery company out there. If I could rate lower then a zero I would. The worst delivery company out there. I had a box lost on 11-18 I called three times was advised I would get a call back in two days and as of 11-27 I am still waiting for a call back on where my box was delivered too since it was not delivered to my address. They don’t care about customers. Horrible customer service. First time using purolator and I will never use them again. FedEx and UPS care about their customers Purolator doesn’t.

Admittedly I don't have issues with Purolator 90% of the time, but that's very poor compared to UPS and Canada Post.

Amazon., please stop using Purolator.

Edit: To add some positivity, their customer service has always been friendly when I had to contact them. In my experience they've been easy to contact and have been very helpful.

"Purolator is awful. I live 30 minutes from a city and the company use to deliver here and gave me a sticky label with bar code for my front door so they can drop the package off in case I am not home. Received a phone call to pick up a package. The package has no tracking number as I never ordered the package and at the time did not know who sent it. The Purolator rep at a store called and I went to the store to pick it up. I was picking the package up for a friend.. They asked for ID. and told them I was picking it up for someone else. I told them to call the person at home to get his ok. The store clerk said he did not have time. There was no-one else in the store other than another clerk. I called Purolator to put in a complaint and ended up with a very rude employee. I hung up and called again and found a very nice person that took my complaint about the rudeness of the store clerk. We picked up the package and then reveived another call two days ago about another package. Today I received a call at 7:30 am to pick up the package. I told him the person the package belonged to was asleep and he said. GO WAKE HIM UP.. I would never recommend using Purolator. This store representing Purolator is in Camrose, Alberta"

"I was at home when Purolator came to deliver my order, but they did not ring the doorbell or knock, all I hear is a loud *THUD* on the door with the paper slip that says ""pick up your package at this location"".

This inevitably always happens and it's annoying every time, so I go to pick it up and the new guy at the job says ""oh, the package is in the other Purolator location"" he gives me the location. I immediately google where it is and it should be illegal for a shipping company to force a customer to drive 1 hour and 50 minutes to pick up a package.

I'm considering getting video surveillance camera's, I can at least record what the delivery driver is doing outside my door and advise companies not to use this service if everyone else has the same experience as I do.

Shipping companies have one job: Deliver packages from one location to another. Why does Purolator even exist as an option for shipping when other companies (Canada post, Amazon etc.) do this much better? Needless to say: The store I bought from online will not be seeing anymore business from me because I do not want to go through Purolator.

@Purolator: I've read the other reviews. No one should have to call or email about their order in the first place. No amount of extra communication with you as a company seems to be worth the effort considering the experiences others have had. I sincerely hope your employees collectively go on strike and make your company go bankrupt."

"I have ordered on line a week ago through a store. I decided to pay the extra to avoid the hassle and get it at home. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday. When I placed my ordered there was an option to received it after 5pm to someone was home. It was delivered at 2pm. I called customer service, first I was told I had to go to the wear house to pick it up, that is far from where I live. I asked if I could pick it up in a location that is close to me giving her the address or if the driver could come back. She told me there was no way the driver will be back, but it can be picked up at the location I gave her tonight ( Friday) tomorrow. I stated that what I bought I was going to need it tomorrow (Saturday). That location is open Saturday. So I go out and the driver came back when I was not home. ( I was told there was no way he could come back ) I went to the location the item not there. The item now available for next business day Monday 25th on the location.
I did not received the item on time. I still don't have it .

I would never recommend Purolator."
"Purolator lost a very important document that was meant to be delivered via next day courier. I've jumped through all their customer service hoops and they still haven't tracked it down. Now that it's Saturday I doubt I'll hear anything until Monday. I'm extremely disappointed. I paid $20 for a courier service for peace of mind, and it has caused nothing but stress. I have very little faith that they'll track it down at this point, and am upset that I still have not received a refund given they did not meet their delivery guarantee."

"Worst delivery service, do not waste your time. They assured me that my delivery would happen on as specific date, I took the day off only to have them book it for another date without notice. The delivery date was confirmed by phone and on their website, I checked the website the night before and the date of the delivery was still showing . The morning of the delivery when I checked the date had been changed, I called the 1888 number and they confirmed that the delivery was still scheduled. When I called back a few hours latter the customer service rep told me that the date had been changed. I have had the worst service with Purolator and if I had know they were to be the carrier service I would not have bought the item. Updated after a few calls, they did deliver the item."

"If I had the choice to put 0 star I would , as always the worst service ever stop.
I have received a slip that the missed me no one was home on the 19 of November 2019 ,
It’s was stamped that I can pick it up from a location near by my place on 9661 MacLeod trail S.W. location on the 20 th of November after 11 am. I arrived at 4:20 pm at the location to pick my envelope and I was told oh sorry it’s was transferred to the Ogden location in the S.E. so I showed the clerk my slip shows this location for pick up , he said I will email them and have them delivered to this location in Macleod , I said it’s a inconvenience for me to drive all the way there after work , he offered for 2nd attempt the delivery I said that not going to work cause I don’t get home until 5 pm or so,
He said well we need it signed so I decide to leave and call the 1800 number, I spoke to a lady and she was not able to confirm where the packages is and she will make sure the package is dropped off 2 km from my house ,at location I can pick it up from a 3 rd party and she also mentioned I need to sign for the envelope cause it’s from Canada border service agent, I agreed and said ok make sure is there tomorrow. She also mentioned that I can track it online to make sure is ready for pick up the location desired.
So I got home around 5 pm and I found the envelope on my front door.
THATS WHAT I MEAN POOR SERVICE THIS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, I HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH UPS I DONT RECOMMEND USING THIS 2 COURIERS COMPANY NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH DHL , FEDEX, CANADA POST , CANPAR, ETC STOP USING 3 PARTY AND HAVE YOUR OWN STAFF DO THE JOB
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE JOB TO DO ITS NOT ROCKET SINCE STUPID."

"Purolator seems to make an effort to hire employees with the literacy skills of an eight-year-old.

The first time, the courier lied about delivering a package. We practically had to twist the arm of every supervisor to find the thing before it ""magically"" appeared.

This time, they misdirected my package to another city. I was relying on that package today. Now, because some illiterate moron can't tell the difference between two city names, I'll be missing an important delivery.

STOP HIRING INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. I paid for next-day shipping and I didn't get it. Twice. You broke your end of the deal. But will I get a refund? Of course not.

Never again, Purolator. That's two strikes, but I won't give you a chance for a third.

Don't bother trying to retain me with one of your fake copy/paste apologizes. How about instead of being sorry, you just stop being incompetent monkeys?"

Don't order from Amazon if not delivered through Amazon
Other companies use this BS company that delivers your product without signature to the WRONG address

"The worst company and the worst choice. Their delivery person will put note paper at your door and will not bother to deliver your most important package at your apartment door, or will not bother to give you call or ring your bell. Then you have to go their office to pick package while you have paid full amount for the delivery... They did same to me 3 times in Toronto. Never trust them if you have important documents to be delivered at your door."

I have never received any parcel directly from them when I was home. Picking up everytime at their pickup location. And they don't even have that many locations or drop off points. The location I always have to go to is open from Monday to Friday from 8AM to 6PM. So I will have to miss work or take time off just to pickup a stupid package. My hourly wage might actually be worth more then the actual item ordered. And they deliver only during working hours? And pickup location only during working hours? Why even bother calling yourself delivery company.

"Absolutely terrible service! Just like others have said below, the delivery person never knocked, just left a note on the door saying no answer, but that's a lie as I had taken the day off and was right there as was my roommate. When I called to schedule redelivery, I was told they would try in the evening. Instead, they came at 9am, but left no 2nd note so my husband waited around from 3pm to 8pm & missed his workout for nothing. Then I did live chat & they told me they don't do evening service unless you pay a premium! Called again to speak to a manager who now claimed they never do evening service! Or weekend! and I would have to wait till Monday & be home or leave a note with my signature on the door exonerating them from any blame should someone steal my package. I never complain about poor service, but this is ridiculously bad!

Update: Redelivery ended up coming on Saturday after all even though I was told Monday. Delivery person was confused when I said the manager claimed they don't do weekend or evening service, saying ""We deliver everyday until 8pm."" Box was banged up (deep scratch marks right through the fragile sticker & completely through the outer cardboard). Opened it to find mirror completely shattered despite very good inner packaging (not cracked - shattered). Called customer service to complain AGAIN and was told I couldn't start a claim till Monday. Being worried I would just get accused of breaking the mirror myself, I insisted she put a note on my file immediately which she said she'd do. We'll see. So so so angry. 😠"

Today rolls around and i find out that my package is delayed AGAIN with the reasoning this time being ""The package got to the depot late"" with the agent basically telling me i can't pick it up and i have to wait till monday to recieve my package pretty much stating i have to wait a entire week to recieve something i should have gotten yesterday"

Seriously these guys don't even call or buzz on your door! They just put the receiver unavailable without even trying. The fact that I'm just waiting for the shipment ALL DAY AT HOME but they didn't show up and their online status showing the driver attempt two times which totally lie at all. least bother about to leave the delivery miss notice.

"Awful is an understatement!!

So I ordered something from Amazon, and it was supposed to be here Wednesday, Wednesday comes around, no package. So I go to Amazon tracking and it says that the driver tried to drop it off in Etobicoke ( it should be coming to Mississauga). Today rolls around, still no package and once again I find out, they tried to drop it off in Etobicoke . So I call Purolator, explain everything, she says she has no idea what's going on, they have Mississauga as the address , then she switches to Toronto than back to Mississauga, then asks if it's Amazon. I say yes and she basically blames it on them ( I had a sneaking suspicion that Amazon WAS NOT to blame though), so I contact them. The Amazon guy says no Purolator is the problem, not the shipper and not Amazon. So now, I am supposed to have it delivered again to the right place.. We'll see..
Just fyi to the employees of Purolator. Etobicoke, and Mississauga are TWO DIFFERENT PLACES. Just because they're both in the Greater Toronto Area doesn't mean you can just write Toronto on everything. This will be my first and hopefully last time using Purolator. You guys make UPS look like Saints because at least they deliver ( or pretend to deliver) to the right place.

Wrong address , Right City, I could understand . But wrong address AND wrong city.. WHAT??"

Was suppose to deliver my package monday, instead drove around with the package then drove it back to the warehouse.
Next day currier claimed to have tried to deliver it, everyone was home and nobody came. Then proceeded to lie and say nobody was home and he tried. DIDNT LEAVE A NOTICE OR ANYTHING. Called the company all they can say is I dont know and it will come tomorrow. They are worth nothing this company should just be closed in general. Staff have no clue what the hell is going on, curriers can't even handle delivery a simple package, everyone i've talked to there is incompetent and cant even give me a decent explanation ."

"If you need a package delivered by a certain date, DO NOT use Purolator!!!!! They do not seem to feel any obligation to deliver it on time and do not take any responsibility or have any remorse when it is not delivered on time. The last 2 times I’ve ordered online and needed the package for special occasions, it has not arrived even though it was scheduled to arrive in plenty of time. Calling customer service is useless. All they say is, “Sorry you didn’t get your package on time. You’ll have to contact the seller because we are contracted to them.” The seller shipped it on time! It is NOT their fault that Purolator didn’t deliver it!! If a retailer ships by Purolator, I will either request that they ship another way or I will cancel my order."

They will tell you it's because there wasn't a door code provided even though in the ""Instructions for Delivery"" it very clearly states the door code. Not to mention even if they are too blind to see the door code in the instructions for delivery, they can search by name, which calls the phone of the resident automatically. Absolute morons."

"I complained on Amazon due to a package showing up damaged and wasting my time. Now my local carrier is playing mind games with me, intentionally missing my delivery when I know it was on his vehicle out for delivery and I saw him on my street. The tracking was updated at 6 a.m. for delivery, and didn't receive any updates till 9:30 p.m. I shouldn't have to wait all weekend because some petty High School Dropout who's getting paid way too much frankly thinks his job should be free from recourse when he exhibits poor work ethic.

"Worst experience ever! Purchased a ride on car for my niece, it’s not like it was a 50.00 toy. (400.00). On delivery the box looked beat up and a tear in it. My sister told the delivery driver, and was worried about the condition it was in. So, the delivery driver said he will take it back to the depot to have “inspected”so if anything is broken they will be held responsible.. Thats fine and dandy, he also said they would delivery on the next day. And of course it wasn’t. My sister called the depot, and they said they forgot to put the item on the truck.. Most important this item is a bday gift. I ordered this item because I knew she would have it on time for her bday. Purolator had FAILED, NEVER AGAIN PUROLATOR. When I ordered this item off EBay, it showed the store is 2 hrs away from my sister. It’s not like it came for a different country. It was just down the road, and the box was beaten up. So, all and all definitely worst experience . My niece does not have a present to open on Nov.9th for her BIRTHDAY just because of incompetence. Thank you Purolator..

I ordered a 2 Pairs of shoes and a collectible... seems pretty straight forward. I left the house for 15 when I got back there was a call on the phone. (I live in an apartment) I see that they came and I just missed them. No big deal. They however didn’t leave a slip so I had no idea where my product was. I took my tracking number and attempted to track my packages but the website crashed several times. I eventually had to call which I had extremely rude customer service which told me my tracking number was corrupted. (It wasn’t) eventually I put my number in again and it worked. (Finnaly) it was at a purolator station no where near me. The package said it only contained the shoes as that’s what the email updated me of. I drive in heavy traffic to get my package. I give them the tracking number receive my package and drive home. Once I check the email still no email on the collectible. Just in case I check the tracking number and it says error ur package has already reached Barrie and is at the same facility yet I was never notified now I have to wait two days to pick the next package up!!

"If I could give a zero star rating for Purolator I would. :(
I ultimately learned quite by accident (3 days after the fact) that Purolator came by my home last week to deliver a package (an envelope). The shipper (a financial institution) selected ""signature on delivery"". When Purolator came by I was out visiting my doctor. The Purolator driver didn't leave the envelope at my door (which is understandable), but the unforgivable thing is that he/she didn't leave a notice (the so-called ""door knocker card"") - there was nothing left for me to advise a delivery of an item was attempted. I didn't find out about the unsuccessful delivery until late Friday afternoon. When I then called Purolator to complain about the lack of a door knocker card left for me three days earlier the agent suggested that ""it might have blown away"" (yeah right!) and advised that I could drive to their depot/ship centre (on the other side of town from my location) to collect the envelope. I replied that would be a 2 hour round-trip in Friday evening rush hour traffic. I decided I would wait until Monday for Purolator to deliver the shipment to my home. It is now Sunday as I write, and of course I'm still waiting for a ""next day delivery"" envelope that was sent out to me 6 days ago. Great service, isn't it? And great value for money spent!
This is the 2nd time in as many years that Purolator has messed up a delivery to me, in not leaving a notice of attempted delivery on both occasions.
In my opinion Purolator is an unprofessional organization and they, judging by the online accounts I've read, appear to have a lot of uncaring drivers in their employ. Their Customer Service isn't overly helpful when you call them, but at least you can talk to someone there about an issue. Forget about calling the local Depot/Ship Centre.. they won't answer the phone! I let the phone ring for a full 10 minutes and there was no answer.
Going forward I will try hard to avoid having anything sent by Purolator and instead insist on one of the competing courier companies that offers better reliability and a proven track record."

I called thd same evening (Oct 29th) and was told it would b re delivered the next day...i waited 2 days and again had to call on the evening of Oct 31st and was given the excuse of they did not have buzzer code.

"Consistently drop parcels off at the wrong address. I have had at least four in the last year dropped at my door that do not belong to me and had to deliver them to the correct address myself. My last two orders through Amazon Prime were both shown as delivered but were not there. I went home to check not five minutes after the delivered notation showed up on my online amazon order status and there was no parcel there. So either a thief is following the truck and immediately stealing the parcels or more likely the driver is dropping the package off at the wrong address. Their help department runs a trace and says they confirm through GPS that the parcel was correctly delivered but I do not believe them. I will not stay with Amazon Prime as they appear to use Purolator as their main means of delivery and in my experience Purolator, or at least the driver on my route, is totally incompetent. Better to wait a few days and get the parcel through Canada Post"

But the one I ordered with Purolator did not. I checked my Amazon account, and was told that I entered an 'INCORRECT ADDRESS'. Apparently, the very house from which I type this, the one where I live in now, does not exist.
I spoke to them over the phone the next day, and assured them, that my address is a real one, and that if they had any issues, they could deliver it to an alternative address (my business address). But nothing came of this call - there was no sign that they had paid attention; after checking the delivery process on Amazon, it's the same thing - 'INCORRECT ADDRESS'. So I talked to them a second time, and was assured that it would be delivered the next day. Another day came, but the package did not.

So, I chatted with them a third time, this time - I was noticeably furious. And since it was a Friday - they do not perform deliveries on Weekends, so I will have to be waiting even longer. (Now, I can understand if it's a Sunday, but Saturday too? How they can afford to be so leisurely as to refuse deliveries on weekends is beyond me, honestly...) This serendipitous timing on my part made me feel even more cheerful towards them.

By the way, they have a website, which has a so-called 'Live Chat'. Except it is not a Live Chat at all. It is just a standard two-way communication via their company email address. And it's certainly not a 'Live' chat - they will take hours, sometimes days to get back to you. In my case, the first time I tried to speak via 'Live Chat', I did not get a response until the very next day. I then sent them a followup email yesterday morning and even now, I still haven't received a response.

This company seems to have little-to-no staff coordination, and zero punctuality with their Live Chat and delivery time. Even though I left my contact information on my Amazon Shipping address, they do not seem interested in contacting me to let me know about any delivery problems. Even though despite their faulty navigation system, my address is a real one, you can literally find it with a Google search, not to mention the fact that the very same day they attempted delivery, the other delivery company successfully delivered my item with no difficulty whatsoever. With their absolutely stellar navigation skills - I'm amazed the package even left the warehouse.

I even received an email notifying me that they attempted to deliver my package but they 'missed' me. I received no such visit. There was no receipt left at the door certifying their attempted delivery, nor any kind of photo of the front door sent in the email. And if it were true that they had visited me, then that would mean that they had successfully found my address after all, in which case, it was a real address and not entered incorrectly! So - which is it then!?

Final complaint - their automated mechanical Answerphone is a ridiculous waste of time; just put people through to a customer service representative immediately; I don't want to speak to a machine; let alone one who cannot clearly make out my pronunciation of letters and numbers.

In Short: Purolator have got to be the worst Delivery company I have ever used. I'm not native to Canada, so I hope this is not what people consider standard delivery service here. I am furious that they cannot help me - all I want is the thing I ordered, I don't want it returned, I don't to be refunded, but for God's sake - it is as though they are inconveniencing me at every turn because they know I cannot do a damn thing about it."

"Terrible service. Classic big company not caring about the client. Package was delivered to the wrong door and had to be redelivered the next day and they (for some reason that I could not identify) didn't get the package on the truck the next day. How much energy is waisted by this back and forth. I suggested they hire another currier company to get my package to me rather than having to wait until after the weekend, but they refused. It's an on line purchase and I've told the retailer I will not be accepting the package (I needed the tools and had to buy them at another retailer) and will be sending them back for a full refund. Purolator just did not want to think outside the box. It will now cost them more to deliver and return to the depot and back to the on line retailer than it would have to get a local currier to get me the package and fix their error. NO LOGIC."

"Garbage business. Lazy, incompetent and apparently illiterate. Unable to perform what they are paid to do: deliver a package. I have been trying t get a 65 lb package delivered for three days. Told on two days to wait over a 12 hr window for delivery. No delivery done. The third day I wrote, as dictated, the note authorising the package to be left. They claim they tried to deliver, but had no reason why it was not left as instructed.

I called for the eighth time and was then told it is available for pick-up. This is not what I paid the delivery charges for.

Be warned-stay away from Purolator, insist that your shipper use their competitor or you will cancel the order."

"Purolator has continued to remain entirely unreliable. I have not received my package even though I was home ALL day waiting for it. Said it was delivered in the am... I sat here in my living room watching TV and staring STRAIGHT out my window. IT DID NOT COME HERE. And now they say, ""well the computer says it was delivered so I can't help you"". Great, thanks so much for the robbery of this pregnant lady. Don't know how anyone sleeps at night any more. I called to find out what is going on and they said they would follow up. I had to call back myself because they didn't get back to me. I also emailed numerous times. Not surprisingly this has happened with purolator before. One time they took a signature from an imposter who even spelled my last name incorrect (hello!! The last name isn't spelled right!!) and that $200 parcel was never resolved and I didn't get a refund so even a signature doesn't help! Another time they refused to deliver a package to my husband saying it was delivered and then when we said it was not, they responded with: ""Oh, maybe it fell beneath or inbetween the seat ...""; the package was a part for a weight lifting set which would be larger than a jumbo box of cereal... fell beneath the seat my left foot. And they never did deliver that package either.... ""It fell between the seats, sorry can't help you"" is what we were told. What is going on in the minds of these criminals. This company is seriously mismanaged. I am so done with it. I have fully understood why so many family and friends have told us to never use purolator. And now, because of my frequent inability to see the negative in people and companies I have been taken advantage of by purolator too many times. I have had enough just like most people I know have also. It's sad that the standard Canada post is more reliable than this company. I know this comment will fall on deaf ears because too many of the employees in this company simply don't care about their customers and it's simply a job, not a service they provide as evidenced by the amount of people who ""tried but can't"" help. I understand one mistake or mishap, but every time I use purolator? That's a crazy coincidence or it could be that this company's management has its head up its own rump."

"This is the worst carrier ever! In summary:
1 - They provide a bad service (leave a package in the rain, without knocking on the door or ringing the bell AND they come to collect the wrong package but not return my package)
2 - Make a mistake (someone else's package delivered to my place)
3 - They lie (saying that MY package was delivered to ME at MY place)
4 - They have a beyond terrible customer service that can not even submit a complaint to management.

Here is the context:
They left someone else's package after 6 PM in the rain and by my door without neither ringing the bell or knocking on the door. I called Amazon and they sent a Purolator driver to collect the wrong package, but after 2 weeks, I have not received my package.
They now claim that my package was delivered to my place, which is a complete absurd!
I contacted the Purolator customer service and the lady told me that, to place a complaint, I need the tracking number from the package that was delivered to my place, which I no longer have, and told me to contact Amazon to get this solved."

"Horrible service. They give you an 8 hour delivery window, which is ridiculous in itself, and then don’t show up. Not even a phone call to arrange another time. If I ran my company like this I would be bankrupt. With all the other 💩y reviews and all the bull💩 cookie cutter apologies given by Vanessa and their “team” you would think they would do something about it. I guess not. My supplier hired them so no choice on my end. If it was up to me, I would never use them. My supplier will also be hearing from me regarding their poor choice in delivery services. NEVER USE!!!"

"I made an account just for this review because I have had the misfortune of having to deal with Purolator several times as they seem to be the only people who deliver items to Canada from the US. There have been several times where a delivery attempt was made and they either didn't bother going up to the apartment door (when someone was home all day) or leave me a notice of delivery and if they did leave a notice, it was to pick up a package at a facility that is no where near where I live and would take over an hour to get to. They also have terrible customer service. I requested a redelivery, explaining that the front door is always open and not locked (apartment is above a business) so they can just come up and knock on the apartment door. I get a call the next day from a lady who said they won't be doing that. No explanation just a rude tone and barely helped me find another place to pick up the package. I told her to simply send it back because I wasn't going to spend two or three hours of my day picking up a package that they were too lazy to deliver. This last time when I had to deal with them, whoever attempted the delivery said there was no entry code, I live in an apartment above a business...there is no entry code or device to punch in any codes located anywhere. I explained this to the representative and asked if there was a way to put in a note that they could just open the door and come up but he said he already put that there is no entry code needed which wasn't what I was asking for. If I had a choice in delivery service I would avoid using them at all cost. The delivery people seem lazy and customer service is hit or miss, either helpful, rude or very blasé about helping."

"Wow! Came to post a negative review and figured that I’m not the only one. Purolator will go bankrupt if they don’t improve the delivery service.

Was all day at home, lazy delivery worker didn’t even bother to knock on door or ring bell but just left a notice for pick-up at their location.
Not only that, arrived at their pick up location with the notice, presented ID but the condescending employee refused to give me the package because the address they shipped to doesn't match with my Id even though it’s the same Name written on the parcel. To the worst, the employee said “ People get embarrassed about not having the correct documents and take it out on our employees”.

Seriously?!

It’s time for the management to look at the daily operations. Or keep acting like this and soon you won’t be in the market."

Highly disappointed with the services of this company. I supposed to get my documents on September 10 Or 11. They sent back the document to BLS internationals( the company who sent me important documents) by saying that they came to my home 3 times and no one was there. Totally lie. Why they didn’t leave a note? Why didn’t make a call or email? Purolator has my phone number and email as well. The way Purolator woks in Canada are highly unprofessional and non people friendly.

"Missed delivery by 15 minutes, rescheduled delivery--only available next Tuesday. Ok, fine. Then the debacle began. In office at 8am (because Purolator says that's when business hours begin) but... never put on truck.
Scheduled a redelivery, ok. Never put on truck on agreed-to day (which you can only discover by lunch time).
Scheduled a redelivery. Had to come back from a business trip for this. NEVER PUT ON THE TRUCK. This company has 0 respect for their customers, are willing to make the same ""mistake"" ad-nauseam until you get tired and go pick it up. Never got the item, cost of said item tripled thanks to purolator. Never, ever, again.
And there's no where to actually file a complaint with them, so I'll just publish this everywhere I can."

"If I could leave 0, I would. Multiple + conflicting stories and 0 help around a missing package.

Placed an order through a company that shipped using Purolator. Our package was both delivered on the day it was requested, and was undeliverable because of an error. They first claimed the package was left at the front door (didn't specific which - the building has 2 - and didn't leave it at the 24 hour front desk which was 10 steps from the 2 doors) though there was no package at the front door, and the building front desk confirmed no one dropped a package off that day.

Purolator put a trace through, and I didn't hear back until I contacted them nearly a week later. They claimed they tried to call my phone number and left ""multiple voicemails"" but I didn't have a single message on my phone or missed calls. I just got another ""error in delivery"" message again on the day I called, and zero help from customer service, other that I was wrong, and here's the number of the tracer so I could get some help.

In the end I was able to get a refund for my order from the original company, as their records showed my package had been lost. I will never use this company again, and I will never order from a place that utilizes this as a shipping service."

"Avoid for Important Legal Documents

For key legal documents, we called Purolator ahead of time to ask for delivery from Calgary to Edmonton, next day before 9:00 am. They responded that, they can not guarantee that, but, do guarantee next day by 9:00pm.

These were key documents, had we not had the guarantee, I would have hired someone to drive them to Edmonton. Relying on the guarantee proved to be a poor decision on our part.

When the documents were not delivered by 9:00am the next day, we were fine with that, but there was no tracking update, so we called to ask where they were. The CSA said, the tracking will be updated by 10:00am. That never happened, so we kept calling through the day and they kept telling us to wait until 9:00pm because they'll be delivered by that time. 9:00pm rolls around, and, no documents, and we call Purolator, and they're closed!

The next day, they say they don't know where the documents are and will investigate."

"What an aweful delivery company. They leave pickup slips, then when you go to the pickup location as instructed, the package isn't there. This time they stated they couldn't locate my address,, but the driver left the pickup notice on my door, what a joke. This is one of many examples of how this company continuously fails. On the plus side, Purolator is good at apologizing, but just really bad at delivering packages. I really wish Amazon would stop using them."
"There are many horrible shipping companies out there. But of all of them, Purolator is the worst. I have had several bed experiences with them, but this time the outdid themselves. THEY MANAGED TO LOSE MY SHIPMENT ($700 VALUE) AT THEIR OWN SORTING FACILITY!!!! I was the one who had to do the research to figure this out for them. Even though they had 3 days to figure this out for themselves and correct their horrible mistake. Now, because of Thanksgiving, it will ANOTHER 4 DAYS before someone there will take the time to help me. I really don't think I will get my $700 value shipment.

"I am absolutely furious with Purolator's service. I am a teacher and I paid a fair amount of money (between $60-$80) to have a package delivered to me before the Thanksgiving holiday, as my students are starting rehearsals for their major Christmas musical production. I have to start teaching the music on Tuesday and it is essential for my lesson plans. It is Friday afternoon, on Thanksgiving break, and I have come into the school (an hour away from my house) SPECIFICALLY to sit and wait at the front door for the delivery of this package. I waited from 8am-3pm, despite the fact that I was supposed to be leaving for holidays with my family. We have pushed our departure time back, because Purolator's customer service agents couldn't give me any sort of estimated time of delivery.

I have been sitting here for SEVEN HOURS at the front door of my school, without so much as leaving for a bathroom break and I just watched the delivery driver drive directly past the building, WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING and then update my package to ""Could not be delivered.""

I did NOT pay for this service AND sit for 7 hours so that this driver could be lazy and not even bother to try to deliver it. I sat on hold for 30 minutes and am now being told I will be called back ""within 30 minutes."" This doesn't even include the actual delivery. This isn't even accounting for the fact that the first time I phoned in after the driver drove away, I waited on hold for 10 minutes and was disconnected from their lines before I even got the opportunity to speak to someone, so I had to wait all over again.

Purolator's motto is, ""It's not a package, it's a promise."" All I can say is it better be promised a refund and compensation for this terrible service!"

It would have even been easier to pick it up instead of using their service. I cannot express my frustration more. The drivers first attempted a work address while we're inside the building with so many other people and claimed the building is inaccessible. Then, our home address with our car parked outside and all of us inside the house claiming unavailable. The driver is fooling the system and the customer. Again, worst experience ever.

Purolator is actually terrible for delivering packages on time. Ordered something off amazon and one of the packages was being delivered via Purolator and the other by Amazon directly. One made it on time the other showed delivery was attempted yet no attempt was made because I was home all day. You can guess which one came via which service. If you aren't going to deliver to an apartment block or even make an attempt to deliver then please say so. Now the delivery has to wait until next week which is an inconvenience to say the least. I would never recommend Purolator over any other delivery service as the guy on the customer service line seemed like this wasn't a big deal. When people pay to have something delivered on a particular day they don't need it a week after. They need it that day. Thoroughly disgusted with the service.

This company has a problem with delivery. They wont delivery your package on time and if you call to ask, the answer is ""its in transit"".
They tell you 5 days but they will not deliver on time. i have even paid extra to have delivered on time and they always seem to lose my package in the wrong place for a week. Last delivery traveled around BC to various different places for a week.Which they blamed on me . This time my package went to Yellowknife NWT instead of Whitehorse Yukon. Guy on the phone tells me ""sometimes they go through there to get to the Yukon"" Really how about take a look at a map. Wrong again seems they sent the package back to Edmonton to be rerouted again to Whitehorse. Sent this package September 25th and still has not been delivered. Last delivery with this company.If i could have rated 0 stars i would have.I have sent numerous packages over the last 18 months always an excuse . Do yourself a favor and use a reliable delivery company"

"I ordered a bed online and the Purolator tracking page showed the following a day or so later: ""Unable to deliver - Heavyweight. Customer will be contacted to arrange delivery"". Fair enough...it's a bed, it very well might be hefty and sizeable. So I waited for someone to get in touch with me to make delivery arrangements while I periodically checked the tracking page to see if there were any changes (there weren't...it just displayed the same message ""Unable to deliver"" for days). NO ONE GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME. The package then must have spontaneously become ""deliverable"" because it suddenly arrived at my place days later while I was at work so I couldn't receive it and it ended up at a pick-up location. So Purolator, what was it? Was it heavyweight or not? Because you initially thought it was too heavy to be delivered and if so, why did no one call me so we could arrange a specific time and date for delivery? You then went ahead and attempted to deliver it even though it was deemed ""heavyweight"" but you neglected to indicate in the tracking that it was out for delivery so I had no idea that it was going to arrive at my place on the day that it did. I ended up going to get the bed myself from the pick-up location since I no longer trusted you guys to make another delivery attempt. I hope to never encounter your company in the future ever again. You guys seem not to know what you're doing. Get it together for crying out loud."

"Purolator doesn’t even try to deliver my shipments. I pay extra for expedited shipping and any excuse is used to not bring it to my door. There was construction on my street. The UPS driver walked two blocks to get me my package, and the Purolator driver refused to deliver for two days. I called in and complained and then he hand delivered it.

Again, I had an expedited shipment by Purolator and it is going to take as much time now, as if I hadn’t paid the extra money. Purolator is the worst shipper I’ve ever worked with."

"Poor service... tracking says delivered to my door at 10:25 am...at roughly 12pm when I checked... looked outside.. nothing there.. no parcel, not even a sticky note for missed delivery.. I looked over enire front of house thinking driver left it hidden...but nope nothing.. didn't even get a knock on the door as we were home and wife was downstairs. As a ups employee I know drivers are not supposed to leave parcels at the door without a consent... either the parcel was taken off my porch because the driver failed to do his job or he delivered to wrong address... either way puralator is liable for it . Very disappointed in puralator's services. Never again will I use puralator's services"
"Hello Tim , thank you for taking the time to write this review. We're sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with us. The sender can pick the ""signature not required"" option to have the package delivered even if the receiver is not home. In such cases, drivers will knock or ring the doorbell and leave the package at the door and leave. If you do not wish to benefit from this option, I would suggest telling your sender that you would like us to obtain a signature upon delivery. Please email us the tracking number and we'll remind the driver to always knock/ring and will ask to confirm the location where this was left.

"Had a large package sipped from yarmouth NS to Halifax NS only a 4 hour drive, and guaranteed to have it by 8am by a representative, come to find out they shipped it to Moncton NB 2.5 hours away, to then get from another representative ""a manual shipment"" done by a purolator employee isnt guaranteed, but a electronic one is (also done by their employee) why not always do electronic then?
Now have to wait a additional 24 hours after taking a day off work to receive this, and i am still told i have to pay the $260 shipping bill.. worst customer service over the phone."

"I hate leaving a bad review but oh my god Purolator is the worst delivery service I have ever come across, and I am so shocked that companies still use them. In Toronto, if you are not at home, instead leaving the parcel at the closer location to your home, you had to go to their main location, on Kipling to collect your package. For some that means to cross half of town to pick your parcel! So why do I even bother getting delivery? What is more, they have a terrible customer service, lack of common sense, and online tracking system that is awful. I tried to talk to them, the lady from customer service was nice, but without power so, I asked for the supervisor. Except telling me that he doesn’t understand what I am saying (in spite of the fact that the lady from customer service definitely told him the problem) he was so condescend and with no appeal to solve my problem. In his opinion is my fault because I didn’t call them to tell them at what location I want to be delivered my parcel!!! Why this people don’t think! They know my address, they could find the closer location to my home and they should leave my parcel there. This is the normal thing to do! But not for Purolator!!!! And I know why. They don’t care about the clients! The Supervisor who talked to me last night didn’t have any consideration, any wish to solve the problem, any willing to fix things. Why is he there if he doesn’t like the job! Let somebody else who can do the job properly and don’t delay the delivery and don’t put people to cross town to pick up the parcel themselves! Purolator is the worst service out there."

"I had ordered on Amazon for 1-day delivery and was expecting a fast delivery on time for my younger brothers birthday. On the day of the delivery around 1 PM, I had received a notification on my phone indicating that there was a delivery problem and that no one was home. My mother was home and even was waiting at the front for the truck or someone with a package but to no prevail even explaining to me that there were 3 large trucks, 2 of them that were moving and another that was Canada Post, I call my mother to tell her that they had left and said that they couldn't get in. My mother who was in the front unloading groceries the whole time was disappointed and even customer service gave me a horrible experience saying that it was my fault and that it's not their problem. Thank you so much for such unprofessional service, how about next time you try coming in instead of lying to people trying to receive the packages."

"I would give a 0 if I could. By far the worst delivery service I've had the misfortune of wing forced to use because companies somehow have contracts with this ""delivery"" company. They never seem to deliver when I'm at home, force me to go to their stupid store and even when other companies never have a problem with any of my deliveries, you can bet Purolator always will have one. And the driver refuses to come back to deliver even though they never do really knock or try to deliver. Apparently drivers decide what happens and not their bosses since when you talk to them, that's their reply. They have no info to share about drivers as well so you have to take their word for it. And your package gets lost in wrong transit many times. I didn't think I could hate a delivery service until Purolator"

I spoke to the manager who stated ""Pickup is a complimentary service we offer. If u want to send your package sent you are welcome to dropt it off at our depot."" This happened when the driver had to reschedule pickup time. Dropoff driver did not care to leave a slip. Finally I had to go to the depot to pick it up.

"Last month I ordered some Tupperware which was set to be delivered by Purolator (I guess Tupperware chooses to ship their stuff through them.) No notice was left letting me know they attempted to deliver the package so for obvious reasons I didn't go to the depot to pick my order up (as I didn't know it was there.) They then sent it back to Tupperware. When I found this out after the Tupperware rep checked on their end of things, the item was mailed to me again. Lucky I called to check on Thursday evening this week because it was apparently at the Purolator depot since Tuesday so I picked it up Friday after work. On the package it said ""hold until Sept. 21"" so today....otherwise it would have been sent back AGAIN without any attempts at leaving a notice for me. When I asked, the Purolator staff on duty said some drivers leave the notices while some don't....not impressed to say the least.

Update on September 23 in response to the reply:

I tried using that tracking number at Purolator to pick up the package the second time and it just led them to the previous order that had already been sent back. The only reason I got my package is another staff happened to remember seeing my last name on a box when looking for something else."

"I am so so frustrated can't even begin to explain. The Purolator is worst delivery company in the universe. I am giving one star because -5 stars, is not an option. Their drivers are outright liars, they always leave false notification on their tracking( the driver attempted...).. I had two weeks for calling /emailing back and forth still these guys couldn't deliver to mid-town Toronto, like the absolute middle of the city, cause they can't reach the damn door. I just can't fathom the extent of idiocy, honestly. And their customer support is the worst. The rudest people sit on the phone who keep cutting you off. They should shut their shops else I believe I might end up suing them once in my lifetime for the amount of mental harassment these guys have caused.
I have never seen a Purolator delivery person in real life. This is despite staying home the entire day to make sure I don't miss a delivery. Also, last week they not only failed to deliver it to my home, but then delivered it to a depot on the opposite end of town. As I could not take 2 hours off work to drive to that depot and find yet another sloppy, disorganized Purolator pick-up site, I called them to arrange a re-delivery. I gave them my phone number, and told them to have the delivery person call me if I did not respond to the buzzer. Like Amazon Direct delivery people do. The woman told me that their delivery people are not allowed to carry cell phones! Wow, that deserves an award for dumbest company policy ever I am certain that their business plan assumes that the delivery guys can do x number of deliveries per day, provided they just slap notes on the front door, and never ever actually ring a doorbell and meet a customer face to face and actually hand a parcel to a human being."

My shipment was to be delivered on Tuesday (17th sep) but they couldn’t locate the address so I’ve been calling them since then, everyday, initially to get the address corrected and then to follow up. They end up giving an excuse that a huge independent house couldn’t be located, this not the first time something is getting shipped to my address. The house is not located in a new colony that maps are still not aligned to navigating systems. Why do you start an organisation of the employees just do not want to work."

"Worst service ever. I first started having issues with this company in the beginning of 2019. The driver for our area personally assured me he would deliver to our home as we live 2 houses beside his delivery route. I have 2 children now and am unable to drive for a year due to medical reasons. This was a great help obviously, as I use Amazon frequently to meet our needs. Unfortunately what was promised was never delivered LITERALLY. This driver went as far as saying he would direct bill his company for the extra time spent on the drop off ( The 5 minutes extra!!). At the location where my parcels end up being dropped off pick up, the staff very openly state this driver is, ""lazy and unmotivated. He does not like to work"" This is very clear. When I complained to purolator about this issue I was told on multiple occasions we would re-deliver to my home which he did, however this was after I had to call to complain that I physically could not go pick up my parcel. Now today I have called for yet ANOTHER non delivery and am told "" the driver can not deliver to your area"" Seriously?!?!! What a joke this company is. I am calling Amazon to ask them to blacklist their services from my area."

After you go through the purolator hoops then they will give you options other then waiting at home for 9 hours waiting for purolator to drop bye.
Only then do they tell you that you could have it delivered to your work but that will be $15 now.

"Hello,

We do offer the option to have your shipment redelivered, transferred to the service point of your choice or sent to your work place or any other address. All of these are free of charge if the address is serviced by the same depot. Otherwise this would mean that the shipment hast to be sent to the sorting center then to the new depot. All this extra manipulation is not included in the original shipping fee. Here’s a list of all acceptable ID and what to do if you would like to send someone else to pick up your parcel. There are indeed exceptions for high value shipment where the shipper will only allow the person whose’ name is on the label to pick it up.

"I have to write this bad review. I bought a present on Amazon and it was supposed to be there the last week.
I'm not the receiver so it's pretty much more difficult to manage the situation. They just don't want to deliver the shipment. At the beginning I thought it would've been a small problem with no stress, but it ended up being such a silly stressful problem. They cannot delivery because of a buzzer code, which is easily accessible at the door, where is a panel with the numbers. They also called the receiver and ""updated the address with the entry code"" which somehow got lost by itself.
Guys, I want my present to be delivered to the receiver, it was supposed to be a surprise present.
I'm so disappointed, this happened before but I did give you guys a second chance, such a big mistake. I'll have to travel to Canada to pick it up by myself. Well, at least I'm gonna meet the receiver, just for a failing shipment. Hope I don't get any problem while picking it up.
Fix these issues, your company won't last forever with those problems"

Worst service ever. My package was not delivered under the pretext that no buzzer number provided. Although the buzzer was provided.

I called again and the lady to whom I talked was surprised why my package hasn't been delivered yet. They are awful as a company. They lack moral and ethic.

"Similar to every other review here I am gobsmacked at how poor the service is with Purolator. Two orders in a row within a two-week period from Amazon and am told by Purolator they are unable to access our home. Talking with a customer service rep did absolutely no good and they made a point of letting me know they could care less.

With one order it was 3 different excuses. No one to leave package with; unable to access residence; etc.

We live 15 minutes outside the city and every other courier is able to find us, including the no name generic couriers Amazon uses. Either me or my wife have been home every time they claim to have tried to deliver and we've never seen any sign of them. And believe me, when you're on an acreage, you notice when people are driving up.

Now with this next order, it's the same crap just added one excuse to the repertoire - a breakdown with the delivery vehicle, delivery scheduled for next business day. Next business day has come and gone and no delivery. Couldn't be more surprised. This will now go on for the next two days and I'll finally be left to pick my package up at an inconvenient location, yet again (a 45 minute drive one way).

If Purolator doesn't want to deliver outside the city then please, in the future, reject the Amazon shipment. As I say, the no name guys are happy to take the business and my packages always arrive - on time.

I will be contacting Amazon as well and asking them to deprioritize Purolator for our future shipments. Apparently this is an option; I have a relative that works for Amazon and they have suggested this route. Have also asked them to escalate my concerns internally - this is a joke.

UPDATE: So it is possible. My order did actually show up - very late but it did actually make it here. So it is possible. Off to buy a lottery ticket ..."

"Incompetent company owned by incompetent Canada Post, what else to expect? Called them and gave them the instructions to leave the package with the concierge since I have a signed waiver which Purolator agreed to and gave me a reference number, their driver shows up and leaves me another note, they send me an email to go pickup the package and when I arrived they brought it to the front desk then they refused to hand it since it has a return to sender due to their incompetence, their phone support is even more incompetent and their reps have an attitude"

"A bunch of BS!

Ordered $1000 worth of clothes online last week. First delivery date was last Friday, checked to see where my package was and got a notice saying “no entry code” so I called and asked why even though they had my entry code the whole time. Then the person on the phone says the soonest it could be delivered was the Monday after the weekend. Monday came still not here. I called they said for some reason it’s still at the facility and said it would be shipped and arrive on Tuesday. Tuesday comes still nothing here, now they say “delivery scheduled for next business day” so this is now my 3rd time calling them asking what’s going on and they skate around my questions with no real answer. I demanded I wanted my stuff on Wednesday and they promised it would be there. Now it’s Wednesday, I waited outside my house the whole entire day no truck in sight. I check the tracking number around 5:30 Wednesday and another notice saying “receiver inaccessible. I’ve waited over a week now! Purolator is absolutely the worst shipping company ever. I’m sitting here worrying about all the money I’ve spent just floating around from truck to truck. Horrible customer service horrible employees. Nothing but excuses and laziness. I just got off the phone with them now and they assured me it should be here tomorrow Thursday. But I have a strong feeling I won’t get anything unless I pick it up myself. DO NOT USE PUROLATOR. The company is absolute BS!!!"

"Trust me even 1 star is like giving them a thousand stars, which I definitely don't want to for their awful service.

Their drivers are outright liars. I have had this issue twice now.

They keep saying that they can't deliver to my place because they can't get to the gate ! What a load of crap!!!!!!! I am so so frustrated can't even begin to explain.

I order day in and out of amazon and every package reaches me without any hassle but if purolator is the carrier then god save me.

I just don't seem to understand the stupid excuse given by their driver. Huge garbage trucks can reach the entrance of my building all cars can reach, moving trucks can only they can't. Will anybody in their right mind believe these guys and their sheer stupidity!!!! Utter non-sense and stupid people work in this company.

I am so scared now while ordering from amazon and hope and pray it doesn't go to them.

I had two weeks for emailing back and forth still these guys couldn't deliver to mid-town Toronto, like the absolute middle of the city, cause they can't reach the damn door. I just can't fathom the extent of idiocy, honestly.

And their customer support is the worst. The rudest people sit on the phone who keep cutting you off.

They should shut their shops else I believe I might end up suing them once in my lifetime for the amount of mental harassment these guys have caused."

"I have two packages in one order from and to the same addresses. Purolator missed me at home, no problem; but it took another 3 days for them to drop ONE package off at the distribution point - which wasn't a convenient spot from my home. I had also called multiple times about my packages, and no one seems to know what's going on.

But I am told to wait another day or two for the other package to be dropped off at the distribution point.

Canada Post staff can be rude at times, but they deliver the packages in a timely manner. UPS have been the best experience in my Canadian experience. But shipping in Canada are third-world standards compared to Japan, China, or Taiwan - much thanks to companies like Purolator."

"Consistently terrible and disappointing service
Purolator never leaves a shipping notification and will rarely call to say my packages have arrived(old building with no intercom/buzzer).
NEVER chose Purolator to deliver your packages, any other delivery is more competent and deserving of your business. If you order something and Purolator happens to be the only delivery service available for whatever reason expect to drive to their shipping depot instead of receiving your package at home."

"This is the worst company in Canada. It's a headache enough dealing with greedy Amazon but throw in deliveries by Purolator and your nightmare gets worst.

This company never bothers bringing my parcels to the local drop off agent. Forever emailing them about it with no replies and they expect us to make an over 3 hour round trip to go pick up in Winnipeg. Never mind for Christmas they left my sisters gift in the snow outside the apparent building without contacting anyone.

They are seriously the worst delivery company out there and I don't know if the service is worse or the lack of respect for customers."

As a result, in my last email, I asked for my laptop to be delivered to the nearest purolator office if they could not get in, but they send me a message saying ""incomplete / incorrect address provided"" FOR THE THIRD TIME.

"This company doesn't even deserve a star! They should not even be around! All delivery guys should be FIRED! Waited all day for delivery and get nothing but a collection notice. No efforts were made to locate the delivery address. Arranged for a re-delivery and the same happens. The delivery person is just extremely LAZY to walk with the package to deliver. I have expected that I would have to make a trip to collect my package when it's Purolator!
To Purolator: Discipline your staff! If they are so LAZY and do not wish to work, just FIRE them! They don't deserve the job! I will choose FedEx over Purolator anytime!"

"If I could rate Purolator 0 stars I would. Service is terrible. I had a wine fridge delivered and I should have realized it was damaged the way the delivery people dropped it off and ran out the door. They had to come back to get me to sign off on the delivery as they left too quickly. I should have realized then something was off. The entire fridge was smashed. Shattered glass EVERYWHERE. After a giant ordeal of getting that removed I have another on the way. It sits in a status of ""needing to schedule delivery"" and yet no one contacts you. I reached out the first time to their customer service to provide my info and arrange the scheduling as it sat in this status for days. Several days later I finally get contacted and it was right after they delivered me the box of shattered glass. Now i'm going through the same ridiculous process. The most frustrating company to deal with. It may be time to boycott the companies that ship via purolator because I'm just so sick of dealing with them"

Worst of all the status of the shipment never got updated from ""IN TRANSIT to OUT FOR DELIVERY.
i even signed for email notification & only that way i was able to find out out that somehow the package which was still IN TRANSIT all of sudden went to FAILED Delivery Attempt.
is that the way the Purolator works????

"Not just incompetent (the driver couldn't find my address, which UPS, Canada Post, CanPar, FedEx, DHL, and other companies find regularly), they lied when they said they'd contact me to arrange delivery. No such attempt was made.

Then I was called (couldn't the driver have called me to find where I lived? Had he not heard of Google maps?) to tell me to pick up my package an hour away from me and followed with a threat that if I didn't fetch it like a dog, they'd send it back in five days.

Then I had to waste more time trying to arrange redelivery which I decided against because of their profound incompetence. I asked the girl on chat if there wasn't a place I could pick up the package closer to my address. There was. Why could they not have sent it there in the first place if they had no intention of fulfilling the PAYMENT MADE TO DELIVER THE PARCEL?

I PAID money for this! I PAID MONEY to waste a day waiting for an incompetent driver. I called people and wasted more money. I PAID for this and I'll demand The Bay refund the delivery charge and suggest strongly that they refuse to pay Purolator for their incompetence, their contempt, their lying, and their complete lack of concern for their customer."

"Worst company ever.. I recommend that all companies and businesses should stop using them. When you make a complaint all they do is make excuses for each other. Basically, I’m a stay at home mom so I’m home all day and live in apt so I can see and hear my door from my living room. So my package just got left in front of my front door. No body knocked or anything. Like seriously, I understand that there’s no signature required but like they can at least knock and walk away or something just to notify that there’s something on the floor. It’s common courtesy to do so and to know that it’s an apartment building so many people walk through that hallway. It’s not like it’s a house where you can hide it somewhere on the porch, even then there are porch pirates. So I called them to let them know that my package has been stolen and that I was home all day and that the guy should have knock and all they kept saying is no signature required. They just kept saying that over and over like no you don’t say! They should have at least pretended to care and say something like. Ok I will let my manager know and make note of it and have our staff trained better but this woman just kept making excuses and wouldn’t even give me head offices number she just kept saying I’ll get them to call you back! Who knows if she just get a co worker to call back. Worst company ever! Boycott them!"

Ill never do buisness with these people again! 3 attempts on my package because the driver does not read notes or company hours of operation. Totaly ridiculous!!! Oh by the way dont even bother trying to reply to this post because we all know you people truley dont care about your reputation. The next time ill ask for donkey and cart service... and im sure ill get much better results!
Honestly would rather rate it 0 stars. Took 4 days for my delivery when it could have been done in one easily. Hell I could have drove 5 minutes and got the product in store. They never put things in the mail slots forcing me to wait an extra day and drive 10x as far to a pickup than I would have otherwise. Worthless delivery service should probably just go out of business already.

"Ordered from Amazon Prime
Waited home for delivery, video security on showing lobby and front street.Then receive email from Amazon saying:

""Sorry we missed you. Purolator tried to deliver your package today but didn't want to leave it unattended.
Please look for a notice of attempted delivery or contact Purolator for the next steps.""

Really? look for a notice from a driver that video proves never drove down the street?
and customer service, ""we'll attempt a second delivery"",
If you can't manage it the first time what changed other than it's not the Saturday of a long weekend and the driver wants to get home that it's suddenly going to be become possible to deliver the second time?
Bluntly the drivers lie and the Company chooses to accept that as acceptable in order to maximize revenue."

My experience as an Amazon Prime member has been great except when purolator delivers my packages. They're ALWAYS late. Their tracking page is garbage. I even took days off at work just to sit home and wait for the delivery from 8am to 9pm. This is the 5th time in the past 30 days that i ordered from Amazon where they chose purolator as the carrier even after I have de-prioritized them. And they messed up every time! Avoid at all cost!

"I would be ashamed to be associated with this company. This is the 4th delivery completely botched by Purolator. Note left on the keypad, driver claims they tried delivery at 1pm, but video evidence shows they never even attempted or showed up. Complaints dont seem to have any effect. They dont even give these drivers a phone? Either close up shop or fix the problem. You've wasted enough of the publics time with obvious lack of commitment to your service."

"The worst delivery company in Canada, by far! I did wait the whole day for a package and than found a paper with pick up instructions on my building door. They didn’t even bother to use a buzzer. The buzzer rings on my cell, so if they called I would have a missed call on my cell, but nothing. Sometimes when they buzz they do not come to the door to do a delivery or do not wait for me to come down. I called their customer service many times, they were useless, zero help from them. I never ever had a good experience with this company. They will not survive much longer in this competitive world unless they learn from Amazon what customer service is. Even Canada Post improved."

I won't buy from a company that uses Purolator as the shipping agent. I bought 3 things online. They made 1 attempt in the middle of the day when we are at work and then bring it to a Depot 25 km away when there is a Purolator pickup place within 5km of my house. Why do you have to call and request this be done? Common sense. Drop it to the closest place! It defeats the purpose of shopping online if I'm driving 50km to go and retrieve my package.

"By far the worst delivery service in Canada. Unreliable, unprofessional often late and with poor customer service. I'd trust a team of pack mules to carry my goods over these clowns.

If you have the option, use literally any other company for your deliveries."
Just garbage. They always say they attempted delivery and it’s never the case. My local pickup place is about 5 min walk from where I live so it’s not bad but recently they really messed up and made my pickup point 2 hours away!! One way. Meaning I would need to take 4 hours out of my day to pick it up. Luckily the shipper called them up and made them look dumb and they transferred the package locally but what a heartache. Never using this company again.

"Just like their owners Canada Post, I think they are both competing to see who is the worst delivery company. Neither one can tell you the truth when you call in to their customer service departments they both blame each other. The reason I mention Canada Post is because Purolator are using them as the last mile for delivery in my rural community. It takes two days to transfer a package then Canada Post do not update their tracking information online the same as Purolator by the way. This is to circumvent anyone from measuring their performance. Because for a few days they can say they haven't received the package yet from the shipper and only the label has been created electronically, all the while they actually do have it but haven't scanned it. So when they do deliver the parcel they could still be within the delivery window because technically they didn't receive it for two days. When you call CP they say you have to call Purolator for issues so when you call Purolator their customer service manger tells you he can't tell CP how to run their business, in other words he doesn't care they need to change their customer care department to ""Customer we don't care department"". In other countries you can see on a google map the actually truck your package is on and can track it in real time. Even when the parcel is in the depot you should be able to track it. Canada Post and Purolator are still in the dark ages. Not sure they know we now have internet.

Update: Still haven't received my parcel which at the last check was in a community 2 hours away so five days and still haven't received it. I had to escalate with Purolator who then ""escalated"" with Canada Post basically they sent an email, that's what they call escalate. Never going to use this terrible company again they should be ashamed of themselves."
"Hello Ian,

Thank you for taking the time to write to us. We apologize for any inconvenience stemming from this delayed shipment and the missing tracking information.

I see that a trace has been opened on this shipment since the transit time has expired. Our tracers will investigate on this, confirm the new ETA, and contact you as soon as possible.

I’ll also report the missing pickup scan on this shipment. Once we have the package they are supposed to be scanned “picked up by Purolator”, even if we receive full truckloads from Dell. Scanning accuracy is important and we need to follow up internally on issues so that they are not repeated.

More often than not when I'm waiting for a package that is being delivered by Purolator the driver will deliver packages that are on my street and then skip my house, and because I live in a rural area I can see when the driver has left the town and I know he will not be back till either tomorrow or Monday.
I called customer service and all they said is that they can ""request"" that the driver to deliver my package, we all know that's not going to happen.
I wish I had a choice on what delivery company I can go with because I wouldn't choose Purolator.
I can bet you later tonight when my delivery status changes its going to say they couldn't find my address or some lie like that.
Oh and I know for a fact that the driver knows where I live because it was the same driver that delivered a different package yesterday."
"Hello Tracy,

"The hassle and the passing the blame was unreal and I will try to find out how I CAN NEVER ever have any of my packages deliver by PUROLATOR ... if I have that choice.

What a terrible service and what a bunch of arrogant people.

"Left a note and didn't ring or knock. Ring is tied to my phone and they even got in the building and just left a note.

Buzzer is tied to my cell, no calls from downstairs and our door is equipped with a ring camera...and of course no delivery person at the door.

This isn't the first time they do this and I took the day off... Purolator is the worst delivery company here in Ottawa, I absolutely hate dealing with them.

Consumers, avoid Purolator as a shipping option. Merchants if you want your goods delivered, avoid Purolator altogether."

"I will just repost my last review as once again the same problem.
Everything good with Dynamx always on time sometimes early.
So here is my review
:Worst Delivery Company in Canada
I had so much trouble with this company last year that I had Amazon stop shipping with them to me. They switched me to Canada Post Or mainly Dynamax and everything went really smooth always on time never one item late. Now Amazon shipped 1 item using them again and as usual, it is late arrived in Winnipeg Tuesday 2:13 AM, now again says delayed and should be delivered by THursday. Paid for one-day shipping and got screwed again by Purolator. Stay away from them, especially here in Winnipeg. They should just shut this terminal down and let a real company do the work"

"Given the number of negative reviews posted, it should come as no surprise that I found a note instead of my package in front of my house, even though I was home the entire day waiting for the package to arrive. Why in the world would so many Canadian businesses go with Purolator instead of Canada Post is beyond me. This is the second time that this has happened. I wonder if I will ever meet an actual Purolator delivery serviceman."

"Was expecting a delivery to be made on a specific date for my business. Updates seemed to come through showing promise that it would arrive on time. Then unexpected, received an update saying that further directions are required to complete the delivery! Beware using Purolator! These guys literally live in the stone age and do not know how to use a GPS or have a mobile device that contains a map application. Either that, or the driver was lazy (most likely scenario) and found the location out of his/her way despite his day ending in 3 hours from when he was located in the area. Now, I'll have to go to the pickup center and spend a whole lot of time getting there, waiting there, and getting back. Never again will I go with Purolator for my business as this has happened way to often. They cannot be relied upon. Save yourself the frustration and go with another delivery service, please!"

"Avoid at any costs. The delivery attempt to the apartment building will be equal to knocking on the building front door (not buzzing in). Then the driver will leave your package at the location with the most inconvenient hours and will stamp wrong hours on the slip. Then you'll try to arrange for a package movement, which will fail. You'll spent hours with CSR assuring your problem is being taken care of. You'll be told that a formal complaint is open but you'll never hear from manager. And finally, Amazon will tell you that your package was actually delivered while you had no sight of it. After all, some social media kids will ask to email them your tracking number, so they can investigate the delivery, while this is just a sham to create an impression that somebody actually cares and does a meaningful accident review. Instead, save your time and money and ship with UPS/DHL or Canada Post."

"Of all the deliveries I've had since moving near Downtown Vancouver, every single one delivered by Purolator has been late or gone awry. Their tracking information doesn't help much due to being incorrect, talking to call centre staff is pointless and the depot staff don't know what is going on most of the time either.
I have also been outright lied to about delivery attempts that simply weren't made and ""large"" items being late because they need to arrange a scheduled delivery time due to requiring a two man team. Interestingly no one bothered to contact me about scheduling any deliveries and all the ""large"" items eventually turned up randomly days later with just a single delivery driver."

"Even though Purolator is 97% owned by Canada Post they will not deliver to a Post Office. I live in an area that is very difficult to get to. The road is unassumed. My post office suggested I get a Flex Delivery address which allows my on-line shopping to be delivered to my local Post Office. I thought this would be an ideal solution. But no, Purolator said they would only deliver to a ""real address"" . What's not real about a Post Office? In this day and age you'd think they'd have figured this out. Lot's of people live in remote locations that are difficult to deliver to. They also won't release the parcel unless I have ID which shows I live at the Post Office because that is the address I gave. This is totally ridiculous. Very disappointed. Don't buy from anyone who ships through Purolator."

The delivery person claims they tried to contact me to deliver my package. I have been home off work waiting for this package all day. I think he was just too lazy to press the buzzer. Now i have to wait until tomorrow to pick it up. When i called customer service all they could offer me is that I could “maybe” pick it up tonight way up in the north. Incredibly disappointing. I will not use Purolator again if i can avoid it.

"I have a package that was attempted to deliver twice. The business doesn't open until 9:30 am in Vancouver. Both times the attempt was made at around 8:20 am. I went on the chat to find out why they keep attempting before the business is open and I was given the line ""The driver will do his best to accommodate the hours"". So you are trying to tell me that there are no drivers in Vancouver BC after 9:30 am?? I'm getting charged for the package too because ""Our deliveries can be anytime between 8 am and 9 pm. We have already done what you are being charged for.""

"I will not deal with Purolator at all!
I have been boycotting Purolator for a while now. Last time, I ordered a package from BC to be shipped to me in Mississauga, ON, I never got it. Purolator informed me via sticker on my door to pick it up from their location. Oh BTW, someone was home all day when they left me a note on the door...(small apartment not 10 bedroom palace)...so imagine the surprise/confusion on my face when I discovered Purolator notice on my door. By that point I had it with them, so I just had them return the shipment to the shipper. And ever since I decided to continue to boycott them, I had no issues with any of my packages. Few days ago, I ordered something from Amazon. I've been doing so for years and never had an issue until now because Amazon selected Purolator to deliver me the package. I knew I will never get it and I have not. Amazon was kind enough to issue me a refund and file a complaint to their relevant department regarding my experience with Purolator. On Sunday, Purolator attempted to deliver but could not gain access into my building. Again, such a shame as everyone was at home and we are in the building system, but hey. I find about it on Monday because I checked the tracking code. On Monday, at noon tracking shows 'incorrect address'. I contact them via live chat and phone (20min wait for someone to pick up). I provide them with my buzzer code, which apparently they needed. I get informed that package will be delivered on Tuesday. But at 8PM, tracking code shows that they attempted to deliver anyway. Uhm, Ok!? I'm confused. On Tuesday, I check the tracking code and it shows that it is on the truck out for delivery. Excellent! Someone is at home! They have the buzzer code! It will work this time! Nope! Around 1PM, my tracking code spits out red sentence ""address correction required - incomplete unit or apt number""....now, lets just all take a moment to laugh. This is Amazon purchase, not some old mom&pop store that did not fill out my apartment number. So I contact Purolator again via live chat. Agent tells me something completely different. Agent informs me that buzzer code was submitted after delivery cut off so my package will be delivered on Wednesday. HUH!? I'm lost. Amazon lady informed me that it seems my package is lost in transit. Which one is it, Pulorator!? Actually, I do not care. Honestly. I am just leaving this review for other potential customers. FYI this shipment was Brampton, ON to Mississauga, ON so don't bother, people."

"Totally irresponsible!!! I was expecting an important package on Friday August 9th from Amazon. When I tracked it later in the day, it said that package had been delivered at 11:41 that day. However, it wasn't delivered to the address I provided. I noticed the wrong postal code was entered by purolator. I not only contacted businesses in our area with same address but also residential addresses with the noted postal code...to no avail.
I received a call from Purolator this morning who confirmed with their driver that package was delivered to our business which it has not. Purolator also notified me that Amazon would take good care of me. This should not be Amazon's responsibility. It should be up to Purolator who just wants to pass the buck.

In regards to Purolator's response...there was nothing wrong with the shipping label other than postal code. If driver's can't deliver to the address and company that the parcel is addressed to...then they shouldn't be working for courier company!!!!"

"You've never experienced this level of incompetence.

Until you've trusted this deceptive, dishonest company with your goods. They'll allow your goods to stay in your city's local sorting center (as they've done to me) so NEVER trust them for speedy shipping, even if you pay for exactly that. This company is garbage and should be avoided like the plague.

"The delivery notice said the package could arrive anytime between 6am and 9pm. I stayed home all day afraid to even take a shower. No delivery in the morning, nothing in the afternoon. The tracking tool did not work. I tried live chat with Purolator. The first agent (Mellisa) was helpful suggesting I try chatting again in the afternoon. The second agent was less than helpful..at first saying the tracking number given to me by Purolator didn't exist. She refused to do anything for me like identify which driver had my parcel (A flat Screen Television). She told me her information, that she suddenly found indicated the driver was to leave the TV outside the apartment building entrance????!!! No signature required. duh...I told her I didn't think that would work somehow...did she think that would work? At the end of the live chat she told me she could do nothing for me.

"I agree with Ahmed Jordan. Garbage company; incompetent; unprofessional. It's been TEN HOURS and I'm still waiting for my package. Tracking is ""unavailable"". None of this would have happened if a) the delivery guy had buzzed my unit (no buzz on delivery day), and b) the delivery notification card had indicated my initials or unit number--but it was blank of any recipient info. Some other tenant innocently removed the card thinking it was for his delivery. So I didn't get the card for three days! I'm so angry right now I could spit.
FINAL UPDATE: It took EIGHT DAYS to receive the package from the original delivery attempt. Use another company people!!!!!

***Update: Purolator is not worthy of my spit. I've now been waiting for ELEVEN HOURS but if you take into account that they messed up delivery on August 2nd then logically I've been waiting for SIX DAYS. I'm now on hold with the 1-888 numbers (26++ minutes). This company has the worst customer service in the civilized world. And if you check the chronology of the reviews given that many are recent and as BAD as mine it proves that Purolator doesn't give a hoot about their customers because they've done absolutely NOTHING to improve service. I live in OTTAWA not Timbuktu! There are Purolator trucks all over the city. What a pathetic company."

"Worst shipping company ever! I don't understand the logic behind not giving their drivers a phone so they can call a customer to LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE HERE! HOW IS A PERSON SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ARRIVED. ON TOP OF THAT, they want atleast a window of 2 hours, so if there is no buzzer number, the person is expected to stand outside their house for 2 HOURS at the entrance waiting just because the company has decided not to give them phones! After waiting for 2 hours and missing work, I call them to ask where the driver is. They tell me that the drivers decided not to come. They were supposed to call me and let me know that, but they didnt do that either, so I kept waiting. 6 times, consequently - made a pick-up/drop-up schedule, apparently they come to your door, and then leave without saying anything. This has happened through Amazon many, many times as well."

"I paid extra for the package to be delivered at home, I tracked the delivery and waited back the full day for the delivery only to know the next day that the system has been updated to: ""Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter."" There was no notification slip dropped at my place. I had to again alter plans for the next day to drive to Purolator to pick up my package. I need my refund for the extra paid and this is not the kind of service I expect from Purolator, if I am not refunded I will have to proceed to the next step.Overcharging clients and then defaulting from the service promised is not acceptable.

I have scheduled to get delivery today. I was watching tracking history and saw my stuff is on the truck for delivery on 1:21 so I was waiting downstair from 1:50. Then I read the mail that delivery guy didn't have access code on the front door so he just went back at 2:06. which is the time I was waiting right next to the door. I assume they don't even really bother to actually come if they don't have the buzzer number on the rable. that was horrible customer service.

"On Jul 26, 2019 at 3:43 p.m. some dimwitted Purolator driver attempted a delivery of my package, but I was none the wiser since the buffoon never bothered to leave a delivery notification. It was only after I checked the status of my package on Amazon—a week later!—that I saw that the package had been marked as ""delivered."" Delivered? Huh? Apparently, holding a package hostage for seven days, 20km from where I live, is Purolator's definition of a successful delivery. So now I have to travel 20km to pick up my package and I don't even have a notification slip. I'm not holding my breath that this will go well.

Here's the bottom-line. Given the overwhelming volume of negative reviews it is obvious that this company is complete garbage, and there are enough competitors out there that they should be driven into bankruptcy, which is where the belong. The only question is how to expedite their demise. To all disappointed Purolator customers I propose that you call and/or email any company that you do business with and inform them that you will suspend doing any further business with them until they switch to a different courier. The more said companies/sellers receive such emails the more likely they are to act. These should not be idle threats. If Amazon is shipping through Purolotor, tell Amazon to stop and that you'll be buying your books through one of their online competitors until they do. Likewise, when buying on Ebay, send a message to the seller that you prefer that they NOT ship with Purolator. I have already notified several of Amazon's Marketplace sellers to discontinue shipping with Purolator.

If the above doesn't work quickly enough then the next step is a Class Action lawsuit, since Purolator's service, or lack thereof, borders on fraud. Whatever the case, as consumers we have to do more than leave bad reviews, we have to act."

"If I could rate zero stars I would. We have had deliveries from purolator before and if you are not at home, they do not deliver another day. You have to pick up from their centre which is a 30 minute drive from where we live. Well this time we received a notice on our door that we had a package to pick up. Took time away from work to drive there and pick it up only to find it was not for our address. It was for someone on a completely different street in our subdivision. Absolutely unacceptable. How do we get that wasted time back?"

"Again Purolator didn't even try to deliver a package and listed the delivery as inaccessible.
Even after I called the 1-800 number for the last package to say I was waiting outside for my parcel when the truck drove up, waited for 2 minutes, then drove away.
Purolator is absolutely the worst delivery courier I have ever had to deal with."

"I order on Amazon quite frequently and unfortunately they use Purolator most of the time. Shipments are usually delivered without a hitch but it is the few that come up with issues that made me write this review. I am just so frustrated!

I live rurally but not in the middle of nowhere by any means. I had a shipment that was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I checked the tracking online in the afternoon only to see that my address is apparently ""outside of the service area"". Sort of hard to understand since I literally had something delivered by them a few days ago!

I got a call telling me to call them back and either give them an alternate address to send to or they can send to a pick up location. I called to see if they could try to re-deliver just as I had done sooo many times in the past when I have had this exact same issue. I spoke to a CR person who was of no help and was rude, she said she can see my item is on a truck but can't tell me where the truck is going. So instead of waiting for me to call them back to give instruction they just sent it to a pick up location. I ended up speaking to a supervisor who basically said that the many times I have had things delivered it was probably because my home is just outside of the area that they service and that driver was just being nice and drove the extra 1 km or whatever to deliver it to me, but the other times the driver didn't because he didn't technically have to. That just seems insane to me that this is what I am being told by a supervisor! It is basically a toss of the coin whether I will receive a package shipped by them. Now I will most likely have to drive an hour round trip to pick up my package. Dissapointed once again by their service!!"

"I was in need of a hat and since I am currently staying at my cottage, which is over an hour away from the
nearest city (Belleville), I decided I would order one online.

So now I come home to a note on my door telling me that you missed me and that my hat is now in Kingston?!?!
Instead of leaving it at my door you take it to a city an hour and a half away from me

And now I'm supposed to make a 3 hour round trip drive for a stupid hat?

You drove all the way here to not give me the package, but to give me a note to tell me to drive to Kingston.

Why didn't you just leave the package?"

"Puro-(very much)later..... that's what I got when I sent a package from Toronto to Mont-Tremblant with Purolator. The package was to be delivered for my daughter on her 18th birth-day in the summer camp near Mont-Tremblant. The package delivery was delayed to to""Mechanical delay - late trailer"". When I called the customer service they couldn't even tell me where exactly the package was, they also had no clue where was the truck which carried my package. The package will be delivered but it is not going to be on my daughter's birth-day as it was intended, it might be a day or two or three later, who knows.... because the Puro-much-later or may be never had no clue of where exactly the truck was with my package. And what recourse is available to me in this situation - FAT NOTHING! The package will be delivered, but my daughter's birth-day will be over, her favorite fruits that were put in the package, counting on the timely delivery, will most likely rote and spill over the precious mementos that were sent in the same package. Thank you Purolator for making my daughter b-day a very special day!!!"

"My first delivery two years ago the delivery person could not find my house that has been standing in the very same location since 1941. So he delivered my package to the hospital, miles and miles away, go figure. After tracking my package to a wrong or bad address and calling purolator, I was told they delivered it to the hospital, not to worry, the hospital was as dumbfounded as I was.

Skip ahead to today, has to be the same driver, bad address, non deliverable! What the F&%!, how can these people get jobs delivering if they can't read. I was home the whole day, not a single purolator truck came by slow or otherwise. Should I expect my package to go to the hospital again? Do you hire folks that are blind? how about can't read? Where on earth do you find these people?

The scary part is I have 3 more deliveries this week and I am afraid I am going to get this same moro%


I would award zero stars in a heartbeat!!!"

"Their customer service moto is: we'll deliver it when we like so just shut up. I've been waiting four days past delivery date. It's sitting in the sorting facility 15 minutes away from my home but they still are not delivering. Claimed they didn't have a full address, which was provided TWICE yesterday, and today they claim again they don't have a full address. On Saturday was promised delivery Monday; on Monday was promised delivery that day; this morning (Tuesday) am promised delivery tomorrow. Read their responses below and figure out how much they care. I have contacted my seller (BestBuy) and told them how damaging this is to their reputation with customers and they would be well advised to look into Purolator's business practices."

"Purolator lies. It’s really that simple. I’ve been waiting since last week for two items that are allegedly “out for delivery” only to mysteriously flip into “delayed due to external factors”, several days in a row.

Before the vague, and ridiculous “external factors” lie, it was “severe weather or natural disaster”. It might have rained a bit one day more than a week ago. I’m not entirely sure because if it did, it was...well, rain. We’ve had no earthquakes, volcanoes, civil war or alien invasions. That I know of. So, external factors sound pretty much like the driver was either overworked or too damn lazy to drive to my house. My house being a 30 minute drive from the Amazon fulfilment centre where one of the items was handed over to Purolator.

My complaints to Amazon came with my patronage of some years as a subscription customer as well as someone who regularly buys several items a month. This isn’t the first time Purolator has either been guilty of gross incompetence or outright fraud by lying to Amazon and the customer. I’m having a call with a senior rep at Amazon HQ after writing to Jeff Bezos about Purolator’s shameful business practices."

"Incompetent.

As soon as I realized that Purolator was the company that was responsible for my Amazon delivery, I knew what I was in store for: disappointment and a whole lot of my time wasted.

Guess what? I was right!

If you've read any of the reviews here then you'll appreciate me keeping this to bullet-points. Here's the highlights:
• No delivery--4 days past the stated date
• Confusing and vague reasons given for delay
• False information given by 'help' service
• Broken 2nd promise for rescheduled delivery...

I'm waiting for them to put the final classic Purolator touch on this fiasco by putting that stupid notice on my door saying that they tried to deliver--EVEN THOUGH I WAS HOME FROM WORK, WAITING FOR THEM. (This has happened several times; it seems to be their favourite move.)

If you have a choice (I didn't), AVOID AT ALL COST. Seriously, spend the extra money with some other shipping service.

My only question is how, in a free-market economy, such a consistently awful company stays in business. It is truly baffling."
"Hello Steven,

When its Purolator i already freak out because of their history.
Today i waited all day at home waiting for the package and they did not deliver and said to check my address, which was correct and which i have no other issues with other deliveries, their live chat agent was not helpful at all.
I would to not have my deliveries done by them, i asked the agent how i could make that possible. She said to talk to Amazon, and i actually hope i can. I am tired of purolator. I don't write reviews but honestly, they have to be held accountable."

"Purolator's tracking system is hopeless.

Ordered an item 9th July from Amazon. Delivery was set for 18th July and showed as local and to be delivered on the morning of the 18th.

Nothing came. I checked back a few times and by midday, Purolator had set the status to ""The shipment is delayed due to delay in transit."". What does that mean?

I sent them a service ticket. They did not respond. I tried live chat and ""Meghan B."" told me rather bluntly to look at the tracking again the next day after 10am.

Getting the feeling I wasn't being given good service, I called Purolator.

They finally told me they were too busy to deliver my parcel and had received many missed deliveries in my area? They went on to say the chat agent should have never told me what she did and promised to look into it.

Amazon meanwhile told me they gave Purolator an instruction to immediately deliver the parcel, but I never did see Purolator that day. I've now asked Amazon to cancel the order.

I don't mind delays. But Purolator is useless. I rarely use such a strong description of a company, but Purolator frequently misses my deliveries and their tracking system would be better turned off because it is totally inaccurate and the descriptions they use mean nothing.

Wake up Purolator. You're not too big to fail. I for one will ask every company I order from to not use Purolator for my orders.

Mistakes are understandable. Incompetence and bad customer service are a sign of serious trouble.

There are other carriers. I won't use Purolator again."

"No luck with deliveries. I was to get my package delivered yesterday from purolator. I stayed home all day. My package was not delivered and no notice in my mailbox. The only notice I got was from the amazon website saying delivery attempted and for me to pick up my item. I wasn't even told where to get it. Today, I was to get another package. FED EX delivered my package today with no issues. They rang the doorbell so I knew it was there. My package from purolator again didn't get delivered and no notice in my mailbox. AGAIN!! I got a notice on the amazon website that delivery was attempted and I needed to pick it up. Didn't even say where. If I wanted to get my newborn ready and out the door to get the stuff I purchased, I would have done that and went to Walmart, +35 degree weather and all. Now I still have to get him ready and out the door to get the items. Not very impressed or happy."

"Others Horror Stories Aside; Great experience.

I've received my Amazon TV ahead of time; early in the day and as of now (not unboxed) in great working order.

Pretty pleased!"
"I am not happy with Purolator and wish I could give a zero-star rating which this company wholeheartedly deserves for their actions. I highly encourage those considering using Purolator to choose other companies like FedEx or UPS. I recently decided to give Purolator another try for my most recent order which turned out to be a huge mistake. I originally had a one-day shipping option selected which cost me quite a bit, but I agreed to use it since I desperately wanted my item delivered as soon as possible. Sadly, the promised delivery date came and left, and the item arrived late and damaged. The damage was light but coupled with the lateness made the whole experience an absolute nightmare. During the day that It was originally supposed to arrive I kept checking the status of the delivery which still showed the promised delivery date and only updated late in the evening well past the delivery window despite the delay being recorded on their side several hours prior. This withholding of information is truly abhorrent. Once I found out about the delay I spoke to an agent to ask about a refund on the shipping and they refused to refund the shipping cost despite them not honoring the promised delivery time.Being denied the refund was a complete slap to the face because I had paid extra to ensure it would arrive at the original promised time. Overall my experience has been absolutely horrible, and I encourage anyone considering using Purolator to reevaluate and chose another company if you value transparency, punctuality, good customer service and not receiving your packages damaged."

I was guaranteed to get my delivery on monday but when i check the tracking page it says address incomplete/incorrect then i used the live chat to ask what happened and they said that it's because the freaking buzz code is missing!!! It will redeliver tomorrow. So fast forward to TUESDAY, i almost asked for a called-in sick at work just to wait for my damn package but when i checked the tracking page it says 7am- receiver closed??? We didnt even hear the bell rang and they would say that the receiver is closed we've been awake since 6am waiting for the damn package!! And now i talked again to the live chat agent and told them ill just pick it up in the nearest location tomorrow.

"Horrible delivery service and terrible customer support.
This is hands down the worst delivery company I have ever experienced. This is the second time they are making my life hell.
When my company ordered a package to the office they kept on trying to deliver at night for 3 full weeks, even after I called with clear instructions almost every day. Now, a personal order from Amazon and they have managed to delayed it for 1 full week (if it gets delivered) because they want to deliver in the afternoon when I'm at work. To make matters worse, their customer support is terrible and they keep giving conflicting statements. The company has unnecessarily rigid policies; they are unwillingly to make changes to correct their mistakes. I would never recommend this company."

"I am sorry to say that today I witnessed an appalling lack of concern for other drivers and pedestrians from a Purolator driver. I was reversing out of my parking spot at Appleby Village in Burlington when a truck suddenly appeared in my rearview mirror. The driver could not wait until I was out of my spot and so angrily wheeled the vehicle to careen down the next aisle to a drop off spot which was a few metres away. She honked the horn at drivers trying to come onto the parking lot from Appleby Line. This occurred today July 10th, at about !0:45 am. The licence plate of the vehicle was AT59927.I am concerned about the reckless driving and the 'me first' attitude that excluded pedestrians trying to get to their car as well as drivers entering the parking lot. It is a parking lot not a highway."

On delivery day,I was waiting from morning till 3pm, I went out for an hour because I have to, come back I got a note that I need to pick up my stuff. I contacted them through live chat and associate said it will redeliver tomorrow. I cancelled all my schedule for tomorrow.
On the day of delivery,by 11am it said delivery reschedule for tomorrow.

"I had a package that was supposed to be delivered today but instead of delivering the package the driver pulled up with a pre-filled out delivery card indicating they had missed me. They ran up to the door and stuck the card onto the door right beside my already filled out NSR form allowing them to leave the package without signature.

The driver didn't have a package with him, made no attempt to knock or ring the doorbell, and left the filled our NSR form on the door without leaving my package. All of this was captured on my home security cameras.

When I contacted Purolator, instead of offering to send the driver back to my address to do what they should have done in the first place (DELIVER MY PACKAGE) as they are paid to do they suggested that they have no way of contacting the driver. Drivers dont have phones or GPS (welcome back to 1952). Now I am left without my package that was guarenteed to me by TODAY and no solution in sight.

As a bonus I am about to go away on vacation so re-delivery of the package will not be possible at a later date.Thanks to the WORST and I truly mean worst courier company in the whole world.

RE: Catherine's response

""A driver was asked to return today, if possible"" is not acceptable. For one, we both know the driver will not return today and then will claim it was ""not possible"". Secondly, the driver should have delivered it the first time as there was no reason for him not to. Sending drivers out with pre-filled out delivery cards saying you can't deliver does not constitute a delivery attempt."
"Hi Derek,

Thank you for the review. Our apologies for this incident.

A complaint has already been filed and the driver was asked to return today, if possible.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Purolator tried to deliver my package when I wasn't home. Had to drive 1 hour to the depot and it turned out they lost my package. Drove 2 hour for nothing. Supplier send a new package to return my product for repair. Once it was repaired Purolator delivered to the billing address and not the delivery address. Package ended up in the depot again but after admitting their fault they reshipped to the correct address. Purolator won't reimburse me for the costs of driving 2 hours since Purolator isn't responsible for consequential damages and they don't cover mileage or time. Most companies would be out of business when they treat customers like that. Would give a zero rating if possible.

"My package was scheduled to arrive on Friday. I took the day off work because this was a really important package. As of 8am on Friday, the package was “Out for Delivery”. I waited all day just to find out the package went BACK to the facility at 8pm, with no reason explaining why. I had hoped that I would receive the package at some point on the weekend, but unfortunately I did not get anything. On Monday, I went to work but kept an eye on the tracking number throughout my shift. AGAIN as of 8am it was “Out for Delivery”. By 11am, there was an error and I could not receive see any details with the tracking number as there was a “No Informations Available” message. At 12:30pm, again the package was “Out for Delivery”. I refreshed all day when I had the chance, just to come home to see a note on the door that they attempted to deliver at 3:40pm (A family member was home and available to answer the door but she did not hear the doorbell ring at all - in case it matters to anyone, no she is not old or hard of hearing). The note said I had to wait until Tuesday EVENING to pick up my package. Frustrated, I called customer service asking if there was any way I could pick it up on Monday, as I stated this was an important package which was supposed to be delivered since Friday. However, the representative was absolutely no help and simply wasted my time, trying to blame me for the package not being delivered. I am extremely annoyed, frustrated, upset, angry and disappointed with Purolator’s HORRIBLE service, and this is not the first time they have screwed me over. Unfortunately I did not get to choose my delivery service, but if you ever get a chance to choose yours, make sure it is NOT PURULATOR."

"Awful. I was unaware of their previous reputation, and shipped a workstation computer with them. It arrived 3 business days late, despite the tracking indicating it was located in a shipping warehouse just 2 miles from me. Apparently it sat there over the weekend rather than being delivered on the scheduled day.
The exterior packaging was damaged, which was a bad sign. The interior foam structure I included was also cracked. The aluminium enclosure for the computer I shipped looked as though someone had taken a hammer to it. Dented, warped, and damaged. The computer no longer boots, and was effectively destroyed. I will never ship an item via Purolator again."

"I was at home on a delivery date and nobody ringed the bell. we checked everywhere around the house and even talked with neighbors but no luck. This was a very important parcel for me which is now missed. I've seen that Purolator delivered my neighbors parcel to my house before which I handed over to them. My unit is a single family house and there is no way that the driver misses the location. I don't know why the driver didn't ring the bell (not sure if he/she even showed up at all). Purolator asked me to contact the vendor but It's not the vendor's fault, their website shows the package delivered but it's a lie. Never ever will use this again... Happy that this lesson learned costs me only ~$100 not more."

They are a joke. You pay for next day delivery and the agent promises that it will be there and surprise Purolator sates it missed its connection and wont be delivered!! NOT SHOCKING you pay for over night told it will be there and then it never does. When talk to customer service all I get is SORRY there is nothing they can do and wont even let me come to the city where it is so I can get package today instead of waiting till after the weekend for it to be delivered. I am tired of hearing sorry form them every time I have something shipped VIA Purolator. OR I get a call from then with other packages stating they do not deliver in the town I live but see the Purolator truck every day here. They have no costumer service and don't care about the consumer at all. Another company about making money and nothing else. so sad if I could I would give no Stars

Re my negative review of yesterdays date. I am following this up with a 5 star rating of the one person who effectively dealt with my complaint & through whom I eventually got my urgent parcel.

My negative evaluation of the other aspects still applies however with the exception of this one person. Thank you.

"Edit : Thanks for the reply Purolator, but hopefully there will never be any future ""deliveries"" from you.

I knew Purolator was the absolute worst when it comes to deliver Amazon packages but I did not think it could be this bad. I have never seen such incompetence. Just read my story, it's almost unbelievable.

I ordered a bed frame from Amazon. The Purolator truck was on time, on the scheduled delivery day in front of my house. I was waiting by the window for him to come and knock, but he just left. Confused, I checked the tracking status. It said : ""Delivery could not be made, appointment necessary""

Can you imagine ? The package was literally in front of my house, but the driver did not dare get out of his truck to see if someone was here (even though there was clearly someone, I even made eye contact with the driver from my window) instead, he just took the package back to the warehouse to THEN schedule a pickup / appointment.

This is baffling. I asked Amazon to not only deprioritize Purolator deliveries for my account but completely remove them from the possible delivery options. I highly suggest you do the same, out of the 10 packages delivered by Purolator I ordered over the time via Amazon only one found its way to my home. That's a 10% delivery success rate.

Unbelievable."

"Update : I contacted Amazon customer service yesterday and the representative called Purolator explained my urgency and they guaranteed her that My Item would be delivered this morning. I had stuff to do but I didn't want them to come while I wasn't here so I stayed home to wait and WAIT... My package was finally delivered 7 minutes at at 4:37 pm so I ended up waiting all day for a delivery that was guaranteed in the morning. We'll Atleast I have it I guess... We'll the good news is that Amazon was able to to put them at the bottom of the list of companies that are allowed to deliver my package so hopefully I will NEVER have to deal with them again. What a complete and absolute disaster and judging by the comments I have seen here and on other blogs, management will need to step up.


I ordered a gift on Amazon to that My son asked for his birthday, I double checked that the gift was available with Prime and I was promised to receive my package for today. I have been living at the same address for 3 years now, my street is a big street in Montreal-North, as soon as you type my address on Google it comes up with clear instructions and mind you, my duplex is the 4th building in that street so very easy to notice and find. In 3 years I have NEVER had any issues with deliveries (From Amazon or any other company) I have always received my packages on time at my door but NOT TODAY!!! for the first time Amazon used Purolator to deliver my package and Surprise Surprise I didn't receive it cause apparently they couldn't find my address, I called customer service a 1h30 pm to explain that I had a message from Amazon saying their driver could not find my address and I also explained that I really needed the package for my son, the representative checked my address on her map and SURPRISE, SHE FOUND IT EASILY AND MY HOUSE IS 15 MINUTES FROM WHERE THE STORE IS LOCATED. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with her, she tried to talk to a bunch of other departments but they never got a hold on the drive, she said she was going to send him a message and a copy of the itinerary and also a message the explain the urgency of my package but that all she could do. So now the day is ending, I haven't received the package and I am gonna have to wait until Tuesday to get a delivery or go pick it up at their store since this is a long weekend in Montreal. It's really frustrating and I am going to find a way to get Amazon to NEVER deliver my packages through that company ever again."

"Edit: Good news. Amazon was able to blacklist Purolator for all my deliveries. It took 5 minutes via the chat support.

Purolator is a real joke in urban areas. They don’t do any effort to deliver the package and they won’t leave the package at the door. Even if you ask them too. Even if Amazon ask them too. After only one try, they leave the package that’s an HOUR away by car, even more by transit.
I live in Downtown Montreal and they want me to go all the way to LACHINE to get a 10$ item.
Every other courrier manage to get it right and find a way to leave the package in a safe place.

If Purolator can’t handle residential deliveries in an intelligent way, they should stop doing them. If Amazon keeps using Purolator for urban deliveries I will cancel my Prime membership because its more a pain then anything else.

Reply to the social media team: Why won’t you leave it in a depot that’s near my place in the first place??? Also, its a HOME delivery service, not a go to the store to get your package service..

This is my second time that purolator lost my package. All I used this carrier just two times. Ridiculous? Yes, they deserve it.
I bought a globe from amazon and worth 100 dollars , the tracking shows that the package was shipped to my door but I did not get anything, even though I stayed at home everyday with my three kids. I call the purolator and they say they can not do anything since the gps showed the package has been delivered. How can this happen? You can throw my package anywhere and tell me it was delivered.

"I am writing to inform you that I am very disappointed with your company's delivery person in my area. Many times I have ordered items online and they come to me perfectly BUT they are delivered by a different carrier. When your company delivers it they never properly do it.
One recent occasion was a package I ordered from Amazon. It was meant to be a same-day delivery due to the fact that I am back to work the next day. I always check the tracking status to make sure to expect them. At 7:11 pm I check the status again to find out they “attempted” a delivery. Which I call this bull. Now to support my case I took pictures as well and if you require so I’m more than happy to send it to you. Why I call this as such is because no attempts were made to call through the intercom. Again, I can show you the list of calls I received from my phone and not came through my intercom. I go out of my building to find a slip attached on the front of the building as I live in an apartment. Now if they look at the intercom it says to dial the apartment # to contact the tenants of that building. My apartment number is written on my address. Therefore, this tells me that they had no excuse to just put the slip in front of the building door. This tells me that they didn’t bother at all. And now I have to go to one of the pick-up locations to pick up the item. I would’ve left it at that BUT their location is open Mon-Fri 9am-7pm Sat&Sun 9am-5pm. Well, guess what, I am now back to work for the next five days. And I work 9-5pm every day and traveling to the downtown city for an hr each way. I work as a manager in the hospitality industry and therefore I don’t go home exactly at 5 pm. So, what exactly will happen to my package then? Returned to the seller right. More headaches and more pain for a simple package that was supposed to have been delivered if and was delivered properly.
Now why I am writing this letter? Because I am done taking this kind of bull from your company. I can’t always choose the carriers the company I buy from therefore you as a company needs to address this issue with whoever delivers your packages. This has happened so many times that its so frustrating because most time that I get something delivered I get it so I have the day off which works wonders for other carriers but seem to not work with Purolator because again they just put a slip on the front of your door and calls it “attempted” delivery. For a company that has the word “Promises Delivered” to their website and ads is false advertising. If not taken seriously then you as a company is a failure. I tell this to all my friends and contact and to ensure not to use your company as a carrier. Even the property I work for no longer uses Purolator. I have Amazon and Sephora ensure that when I order items from them that they will not use Purolator as a choice in delivering my items but again I can’t always choose what others will use. I hope that you take this seriously and that to address such issues with your deliveries. I would like the person who delivers to my area as well be put responsible for his actions. I am more than happy to provide you with the information of you require to find out who that person is. Again, if you’d like pictures I will happily send them to support my case. Thank you and you have a good day."

"Very ridiculous service. I ordered a package from Amazon that was supposed to be delivered on Monday.

It took a whole week after that to get my package, not even delivered, but they dropped it off somewhere and told me i had to go get my package myself.

Apparently their idea of delivering a package is to come to your house, no buzz, no phone call, just stand for barely a few minutes, stick a stupid 'delivery attempted' note on your door and leave! And i was just right upstairs! How the heck is one supposed to know their delivery has arrived if there is no form of communication whatsoever?$$%%!!

"Hello Doug,

We're sorry to see that you're upset with the delivery. A 80 lbs air conditioner cannot be handled by 1 driver, for his security and for the people around him. Therefore, an appointment must be scheduled so 2 drivers can be sent out to complete the delivery. For remote and rural areas, it's possible that delivery is not available for heavy shipments. If you'd like us to look into this shipment for you, please email us the tracking number and complete address. We'll be glad to assist.

"I made a complaint about Purolator last month, about a late and then missed delivery to my home. I have spent weeks trying to get an answer from them. Tracking says they tried to deliver an already late package at 3am and at 6 am (which are ridiculous times!) but I was home and didn't receive anything, not a call, email or even a missed delivery card. I got an automated call at 9am saying my package was already at the depot. All I'm asking is - why would you try to deliver at 3 or 6 am? Were you even at my house? I don't think they even tried to deliver and just dropped it off at the depot, expecting me to pick it up. This company's customer service is terrible. They will respond to you here, but when you try to talk to them about your complaint, they do not respond. Wish I could give them zero stars.

UPDATE: This is to respond to the social media response below. None of the answers I have received from the three different people in your company (including 'local management') have been able to answer why someone who was home, waiting for a late package would not have heard a knock, a buzz, phone call or text to let them know the driver was here. If you had really tried to deliver, I would have happily received it. So to be clear, the 'information I want from you' is whether you were really here at all, or if your company was trying to save time by just directing me to the depot to pick up my own package. I hope Amazon stops using you, and your company customer service is a joke. Thanks for nothing!"
"Hi Angelica, thanks for the review. A complaint has already been filed and you were also contacted by local management who provided further explanations and apologies. He also offered you to contact him next time you're expecting a shipment so we can monitor it. Please let us know what else we could do for you.

Thanks,

"AGAIN Purolator has made a fool of me. Last year they failed to drop off a lovely gift from James Robison Ministries, failed four times. Their excuses were many and I swore never to use them again (I never did get my book). This year I p/u a new TV from Best Buy and it came in less than a week, as promised. Trouble is by the time I walked from my bedroom to the front door they were gone. I'm in my 70s and don't move swiftly anymore. My daughter took me to Purolator's location in my City's south end to pick up the TV. NEVER will I buy anything from anyone if requiring delivery by Purolator. I will pay more (if I must) to hire another service. And, NO, they do not phone you if your doorbell does not get you to your door fast enough. From your bedroom or your bathroom, you will lose the race to your front door. Gauranteed!!!"
"Hello James,

Thank you for leaving this feedback. We're really sorry to hear that our driver missed you by minutes. Due to high volume, our personnel has a limited time to complete a delivery. If this happens again, please do not hesitate to contact us. We'll be pleased to schedule a 2nd attempt for you.

"Over the years, I literally never get my packages delivered to my door if it's by Purolator, every single time I have to spent 2 hours commuting to their pick-up centre to get the package. For some reason they don't equip their drivers with phones to call me when they are at my location, and I randomly get a notification saying I couldn't answer the door. I will make a negative review everytime they deliver my package.

Before one of your worthless social media representatives answer my post asking for my reference number, I've been through this process before, you aren't able to offer any useful solution. My only demand is for the delivery driver to call me when they arrive at my apartment, this is something your worthless company is too cheap to do, or at least leave it at a location close to me not 1 hour away. This is something other delivery services would be happy to do. Stop pretending you care about customer service."
"Hello Tim,

Thank you for taking to the time to write your concerns, unfortunately we cannot offer for our driver to call you at the time of delivery but we can have your item moved to a closer pick-up point. Please email us with your tracking number to customer.care@purolator.com.

"The tracking for an important package said it would show up today! I waited for 4 hours upstairs since in the past, I didn't hear the knock (if they knocked) and they left. I never received any type of notification that the package was going to be delayed 3 days because of an error on their end. How hard can it be to send a simple email? Purolator is by far the worst delivery service I've used. Second place is OOPS aka UPS."

"Rude Service!

The delivery guy was rude. After knocking on my door he loudly exclaimed how my package was too big to deliver into my apartment and that I would have to help him carry it up. After I told him I was pregnant and unable to lift more than 25lbs he said he would not be delivering it unless I helped. Angry at this point, I told him I would not be risking my unborn child, where he retorted quite loudly that he would not be risking his back. TURNS OUT he had mistaken which package was to be delivered. When he returned to the van to look over the delivery MY PACKAGE was very light and he commented so, then proceeded to bring it up the stairs. No apology or anything. Very rude. Would not do business with again and will be contacting Babies R Us to inform them of the service I received and recommend they discontinue business with Purolator."
"Hi Vanessa, thanks for the review. My sincere apologies for this incident. Our drivers are expected to be professional at all times. Our drivers should, under no circumstances, ask the receiver to help lifting the shipment. If it is over the weight limit, it will be classified as Heavy Weight.

"Pick up was refused because I had ""no valid photo ID"". Had a government issued health card, a declaration of revenue and Hydro bill both registered at my address. I was asked if i had a ""Costco card"" because apparently they do not accept the health card anymore. I do not have an habit of having my passport on me, unfortunately.

Extremely prejudicious to people who do not have cars/driving license due to requirements for ""valid ID"" and location.

Excessive."

"I really wish Purolator was a publicly traded company as I would take a large short position immediately. For the fifth time this year that an Amazon package has been shipped using Purolator, they've left a slip on the door with zero attempt to contact me or using the apartment building buzzer.

Thankfully, Amazon has made a guarantee they will not use Purolator again to ship to me. I encourage everyone to talk to merchants to have the same thing done AND do a return for what you purchased so you don't have to pick it up - it's the only way this company will go out of business when no merchant will touch them."

They attempted to deliver and I wasn't notified. I thought it was only slow because of standard shipping until I tracked it and found they attempted delivery almost two weeks earlier!!!

"Worst Purolator Service never ever saw by any courier.

In sequence 3 package came and without any note or call or information, just a sake off it updated that ""receiver unavailable"",

after complaint Purolator investigated and confirmed that they do apologize for the Wong Information updated by driver , as they tracked GPS location and so, and found out that driver didn't came to my address and they will take action on it. However, me as customer we just get the frustration, frustration and nothing else... Why because worst Purolator service.

This been happen with me 3 packages in sequence.... Everytime same issue, Purolator is just a making people ful and playing with people emotions and with their time.

I'm literally frustrated with the Purolator service...

Purolator doesn't even deserve 1 star here....

"I have a serious disease. I was waiting for my medication and was told by Purolator that I could leave a note with tracking and signature for driver to leave it in my mailbox while a stepped out for a few minutes. I came back and the driver had left a card to pick parcel up next day. I needed to take my medication in an hour so called them and was told the driver had message to come back. He didn't. Parcel was out for delivery again at 8 22 a.m. but driver didn't come straight to me. I don't drive due to my disability so can't pick it up. I called again and waited again for 10 mins. I was told that I could not leave a note and that I had been given bad info. So now I have no medication and no way to retrieve the parcel...I have medical appointments today so cannot wait all afternoon again. Purolator is a disorganized, dishonest organization.

"worst experience with this service provider! after a driver telling me he would wait 5 minutes he did not.. and i seen him drive off while i was waving him down. i spoke with 6 different staff in customer service.. all telling me they sent requests to the location where my package is to reschedule delivery.. today i was told it would be with me from 4oclock onwards as they sent the request... i got a call from the location to tell me no delivery was being made, and they cannot deliver after 4 o clock. i also got a rude comment from a customer service member quote ""can you carry the parcel on your bicycle since you dont drive"" (this is a freezer i ordered, i told her this 3 times at the beginning of the call)

result of all this i still dont have a clue where, what or when my parcel will be at my home. (complaint will be made with best buy to hopefully drop ye as a provider for your services)"

I am one of the fortunate Amazon.ca customers that finally received my packages because I insisted on help today and was not willing to accept any more put offs. The order would be returned to Amazon.ca.
All these negative reviews, yet Purolator still gives the 1-star service.
It must be very difficult working for Purolator."

"Editing my review to make the timeline easier to read rather than a block of text.

--

Monday, May 27: I waited home all day because their delivery timeframe was 8am-8pm. No one showed up. I checked tracking, it was out for delivery at 8am, and at 6pm they marked it as ""Delivery Rescheduled for Next Business Day"".

I called customer service and they said the delivery driver couldn't meet their quota for the day due to external factors. That's a little annoying but understandable.

Tuesday, May 28: I wait at home all day again and when I checked tracking, I noticed that at 3pm, they left a note online saying ""Address correction required - no entry code."" We have an intercom at our apartment gate and no one's had an issue buzzing us before. We've had Amazon delivery, Canada Post, UPS, and food delivery all able to access us.

On top of that, there was a paper notice also from Purolator for another tenant's missed package - leading me to think that they hadn't attempted to even use the codes at the front for either deliveries.

Tuesday, May 28, Evening: I called customer services again, and they've left a note for the delivery driver with our buzzer code (which we've never had to do with any other delivery service before), and they've rescheduled the delivery for Thursday (May 30)

Wednesday, May 29, Midnight: I checked my tracking at night and noticed that it said ""May 28, 2019 / 10:42 p.m. / Vancouver, BCShipment scheduled for delivery next business day"" - which would be today (Wednesday) and not Thursday. I contacted live chat to confirm the date and they mentioned it was an automated message and delivery will indeed be attempted on Thursday.

Wednesday, May 29, Afternoon: I checked tracking at 8am it was updated to read ""On vehicle for delivery"" and another live chat representative said that it will be out for delivery today (Wednesday) and if failed, will be reattempted tomorrow (Thursday). A representative reached out and asked if I would be home. I told them I would be.

Wednesday, May 29, Evening: Tracking has been updated at 6pm stating ""Delivery rescheduled for the next business day"".

Thursday, May 30: Package finally arrived after I've had to contact Purolator four or five times to get everything sorted out.


This is four days now that I have had to clear from my schedule to wait for a delivery.

I'm unsure if I simply got a delivery driver who doesn't care, or if the company is severely under staffed (due to the driver not being able to meet all this deliveries the first day, and then not having the time or patience to buzz my apartment).

It seems no one really knows what's going on either and everything's a bit of a mess. The only upside to all of this is that at least the customer service representatives are patient and kind. Unfortunately the delivery services of this delivery company is severely lacking.

--

I have had problems with Purolator in the year as well where I've had to go and pick up a missed delivery which I know for a fact that I did not miss. I had been home all day as I was expecting a delivery. The intercom buzzer is connected to ring my cellphone and I had no missed calls from the buzzer that day either if I had just not heard it.

--

Overall, I would not recommend their delivery services to anyone. I have contacted Amazon and asked them to use any other delivery service available whenever possible, and will be telling friends and family to avoid them as well.

I am very put off by this company and disappointed in their services."

"Too bad I can't give NO stars. In the past year, our delivery guy is TERRIBLE. Swears when he comes up the stairs, or simply opens the door and yells 'HELLOOO???'. Our office is up a flight of stairs, but he's always upset because he has to come upstairs to have me sign. We get an average of 10-12 deliveries PER day, yet he's the only one who finds it INSULTING to come up ONE flight of stairs. We ask him to leave the delivery in our storage every single time, yet he keeps bringing it upstairs while swearing, huffing and puffing. I'm FED UP with this and frankly, he ruins my day when he comes. We buy Christmas gifts for all our delivery companies, we thank them, we give them some of our company uniforms, baseball hats, calendars. This kind of behavior is UNACCEPTABLE!!

"Paid extra for one day shipping, when the package didn’t arrive I called and they told me they couldn’t get into my building. They never left a notice and never sent an email. I asked if next time they could just leave the package at my door, or call me to come down and open the building door (the access code machine is broken). They said of course and that it would be delivered the next day. I waited another day and called again and was told they can NEVER leave a package at the door and they can NEVER phone a customer when they arrive. SO long story short, it’s 4 days later and I still don’t have my package. I called again today and was told I’m going to have to pick it up from the nearest phacility (30 min away). Very unimpressed and was never even offered a refund for shipping costs or anything. Terrible customer service."

The reason why it was not delivered was because they could not find my house (only purolator had this problem so far).

"I wish I could leave zero stars. I'm appalled at the service I just received from Purolator. For one, I got one package immediately sent back to the seller due to ""No access"". I was confused and didn't think to follow up, as it was just one item I could live without for the time being. But my next delivery is what really set me off, as I was waiting on multiple items:

They attempted delivery on Wednesday while I was out, and they left no paper notice--and I live in a condo building, where normally, Post Canada will ring someone else's doorbell just to gain access to the building, and then leave it in front of my condo door.

The following day, delivery was scheduled to be ""attempted"" again, and so I waited all day long--these were essential items, and I did not want to miss out again on the delivery. I called the call centre, and they couldn't give me an estimated delivery time because they have no contact with the driver. I STRONGLY urge Purolator to improve this, as it is extremely inconvenient and inconsiderate to customers, who cannot afford to wait around all day for a package, nor miss out on it day after day. Also, when I tracked the package, it said that ""the driver contacted me to reschedule delivery"", which they certainly hadn't.

I called customer service at 6:30 p.m., and they told me that it was an access problem again. I realized it was because I live off St-Catherine E, which is closed for pedestrians all summer long (every year)--so instead of finding another route, Purolator decided to turn around and NOT deliver my package TWICE. Meanwhile, I had gotten a Canada Post delivery, no problem, that same day. There are three other routes available to get to my place, but Purolator didn't care at all to find them. So, after three calls to Purolator customer service (and each time, the person was shockingly unfriendly), they finally managed to put a note somewhere in their broken system to take another street to my condo.

The cherry on top was when I finally received the delivery today (two days later)--I buzzed them into the building and waited, but they never came to my door. I went downstairs to the building's main entrance, and the driver had merely left my packages there, unattended. EXTREMELY unprofessional.

This is a very unreliable company who needs improvement in all areas of their service."

"Absolutely awful service! They did not deliver my package yesterday like I was promised. I waited on hold for a long time to confirm that they had the write address for delivery. The first lady I spoke with said that she guarantees that the driver went inside the business that was listed on the package and that no one knew who I was, she was extremely unfriendly on the phone and said that the driver would get there today. I called the business and they guaranteed me that no one came there with a package yesterday. I called back again to make sure they had the right address after waiting on hold again for a long time. I was told that the driving did not go into the business because even though it was the right address on the package it was under my name not the business name so the driver didn't go in or bother to call me or the office to verify the address. I gave them the company name and confirmed the address. Then I was put on hold for a long time again. When the lady came back on the phone I asked for the manager, which took a long time to be connected. Mark Groundwater didn't apologize at all! He said the driver was falling the rules and that it was my problem that the package wasn't delivered and that I am not their only customer! I don't think I have ever spoken with a more unfriendly company who truly does not care about their clients. I don't recommend that anyone use their service!"

"UNACCEPTABLE 2!!!

After the review, I was PROMISED to get the delivery today (Even I explicitly told that I needed them latest by yesterday!). Today I called, they said one is on trunck being delivered, unable to provide exact timing STILL, the other one has packaging issue, can only be sent out on next Monday! (I dont understand how it could happen at the first place!) So another week of waiting and tracking ahead now!

Note that I was expecting it from END OF APRIL (almost a month ago)! It was returned because they could not find my address. So the sender (an hour away from my place) resent them last Friday. Until now, a week later, I still not able to receive them and expected to wait longer! I wanted to know where the shipment is, so I dont have to keep waiting. Guess what, in this 21st century, drivers dont have a phone, no GPS on the truck, and they can't locate the distance, the waiting window is basically WHOLE DAY!

All they could advise is to put a note on the door (HAS TO BE ON THE DOOR), to let them drop the shipments without my present.

Please do not give me lips service, I do not need another ""sorry, blah blah blah"". I need you guys DELIVER THE PROMISE!!! Get me my packages!"

"I ordered a school book last Saturday and was shipped via Puralator by McMaster, I needed to book to complete an assignment this weekend. I asked the shipper not to ask for signature cause I know Purolator is trouble, but unfortunately, they did ask for a signature. I got the slip about picking up on a depot thats is a 30-min drive from my house and I called them right the way. They said the package would be available next day on an agent 5 min away from my house. Today I got a call saying that a should go to pick up the package at the depot 30-min away from my home. Called again, all they did was apologize for the mistake, and nothing else can be done, unless is monday. Guess is paying for their mistake? Me that will have to leave work early go home, pick up the car and drive for 1 hour to cover for their mistake. Im so mad that i can't even tell you!
Purolator you are the WORSE delivery company ever. Please review your process, because soon you will be out of business"

"The issue I have with them is they lack customer service. My package is big and so they delay it by a week. I had to ask Amazon what was going on and when they got involved suddenly my package shows up 2 hours after Amazon responded to my email. However of course I am at work when they try to deliver it. I message them early morning to see about rescheduling delivery and they explain the depot will have to call me and they take my number. After getting home at 7:10pm i message again as i got no call and they respond they will call when they have a chance to. I was okay do you have a timeframe and all they say is I cannot give a timeframe and it may be the end of the week. What kind of customer servive response is that???!!! I had deliveries done by Canada Post, UPS and Fedex and this has to be the worst ever courier experience i ever had. Lets see if this call will ever happen! 😡"

"Unacceptable service. I receive medication via courier that requires temperature control to stabilize, which is why it is sent at a premium cost from the shipper to ensure delivery on a specific day BEFORE 12pm. This also requires me to stay home until the delivery is received. The driver did not even attempt to make a delivery (I have live feed cameras). Using the tracking number discovered that it had been ""rescheduled for the next day"" due to non delivery. When the shipper called to inquire was informed that the driver did not make the cutoff time as so it was rerouted to a next day delivery. Neither myself nor the shipper was notified. Cost of each one of these syringes is approx $400!! I am livid and grossly disappointed in the horrible customer service not to mention I am also not in possession of time sensitive medication."
"Hi Thaidra , thanks for the review. Our sincere apologies for the delay. Please send us the tracking number in an email so we can inform the depot of the content, and make sure it can be stored at the right temperature.

"Unbelievable this service. While waiting at home, the door open, I expect the parcel to be delivered to me personally. Instead the delivery person leaves a delivery notice saying ""Sorry, we missed you"" in my mailbox that is only a a few steps away from my door she could have reached before finishing writing the last word on the notice, which of course is not true since she never showed up at my door.

If I knew I had to go pick up my item wherever it was delivered by PUROLATOR, I would have gone directly to the store in the same city, pay for it and get back home instead of using a delivery service.

I mean really !!!"

"The worst delivery service period.

Ordering through amazon prime I've had the bad luck of purolator attempting and failing to deliver a simple package, multiple times. They don't call on arrival, so if you live in an apartment as I do, you're out of luck. I just ordered a package earlier this week and it was scheduled for delivery, knowing it was by a garbage company like purolator that doesn't call on arrival the only way for me to get my package was to wait in the lobby for the delivery truck to appear, I started my watch at 9:30 am and my tracking information said the package will arrive by 9:00 pm, so there a 12 hour period where your package can come at any time with no email notification except them emailing you and saying

""Sorry we missed you. Purolator tried to deliver your package today but didn't want to leave it unattended.""

Please look for a notice of attempted delivery or contact Purolator for the next steps."" Anyways I was sitting in the lobby watching youtube on my phone it had been around 3 hours, I had a clear view of the street and front door, for 3 hours I sat there and waited for my package, for 3 hours I watched cars go by, until I saw a purolator truck speed by, the only purolator truck that had passed my building in 3 hours, then I get an email saying there was an attempted delivery. Absolute trash service, I immediately called purolator and gave them my tracking number, and they kept cutting me off while I as trying to explain the situation with ""Is there a buzzer? does the driver need a pass code to get in? Do you want to reschedule for delivery?"" and more stupid questions that if the driver even attempted to deliver my package, he would have found these out. For the record, my building is open to the public until 7 pm then you need a key card, the driver didn't even slow down, he just passed by. Literally minutes after the ""attempted delivery"" I called and asked for a reschedule and the earliest they can reschedule is tomorrow, the driver is at most 5 minutes away from when I called.

1 star is still too generous for this absolute joke of a company, laziest drivers I've ever seen, I pray to all the gods to end this company and their antiquated non call on arrival, pass my building without even stopping, cut me off while im trying to calmly explain the situation with DO YOU WANT YOUR PACKAGE DELIVERED? DO YOU WANT TO RESCHEDULE? DO YOU WANT TO WASTE 3 FlippING HOURS WAITING FOR A PIECE OF SHstT DRIVER TO WASTE MY GOD DAMN TIME, Flip PUROLATOR AND Flip THAT DRIVER!
Cant even swear in my own review, all the shist are SHI and then a T, Flipping is FUC and then a K."

"Purolator is by far the most horrific and unresponsible shipping company I have ever seen. Never delivers the packages on-time. Alway cannot get to my apartment.

"This company is an utter joke, when I order anything online they are the only ones who never leave a delivery slip, nor any info if a delivery was even attempted.

Typically I have had to track my package down through the website that I have ordered it from, and then had to deal with their terrible automated system, and their pathetic excuse for customer service, before telling them that yet again I will just pick it up myself.

While not perfect, problems like these are seldom with UPS, Fed-Ex, or even Canada Post. If you want to keep your customers even remotely happy with their delivery times use any other company.

With customer service like this, its amazing this company is still in business."

"What happened?? Was happy with purolater for over 25 years. Recently we had a customer call and say our account had been suspended. I always pay invoices within a couple of weeks When I called to see what happened they said it was over an overdue amount from 6 months ago for 1.08. Ridiculous! I never received call or invoice saying I owed this. Now today I receive a collection notice for invoices that had been paid 3 weeks ago. I always pay within a couple of weeks. Since they send no statement I wait for a few invoices before paying. When I called today to complain, I spoke to Nadine and asked about having invoices emailed to try to speed up the process, she said that wasn’t possible. She really wasn’t concerned at all at the prospect of losing a long time customer. Really disappointed in this company has this is The first real issue in all these years. Will be looking for another shipping company"

"Alien deliveries. Kind a matrix movie. Funny but the real story of a delivery attempt.
The delivery agent from Purolator without even attempting to call the buzzer of customer, calls the customer and leaves a voicemail to pickup from their shipping partner without even fully disclosing the tracking id. The customer had access to tracking id from the sending party, checks purolator website and tracks that package and it displays status as ""On vehicle for delivery"". After 6 hours, the customer takes a step further and reaches out to live human agent and gets response the ""delivery is yet to be made"" for a package is already dropped in shipping partner location. For all this great service the customer paid almost 2 times the shipping cost to a private shipping company compared to what he would have paid to Canada post. Wow. This is the real story."

"Easily the most incompetent courier in the history of shipping.
Have had 2 packages wandering around eastern Toronto for 2 days now with no sign of them ever being delivered.
For one of the items, Purolator is incapable of comprehending that customers ship things to locations other than their home.
In order to pick up a package from their out of the way locations you need photo ID for the delivery address.
If you had something shipped to work or even your mom, too bad so sad no package for you.
I have honestly never had a Purolator shipment that did not involve some level of drama or incompetence.
NEVER.
I will no longer do business with any vendor who has this pathetic excuse for a courier as the only shipping option."

We weren't home when the driver came and on the slip he didn't put the tracking number down and we had to search online for it and the location that was stamped on the slip stating where we needed to go pick it up at, wasn't the location that the driver had dropped it off at for pick up.

"I think out of 10 deliveries, 1 actually made it. 1 time they couldn't find the address - and instead of using a GPS or google maps - they actually got someone to print out some archaic layout of the neighborhood with a handwritten note and taped to the box!! (just like it was 1975! )
They have also accepted items that they know head straight for one of their depots, and don't give rats-a__ how far away it is.
If you call them you will go into an endless loop that starts with them acting surprised you want to pick up your package. My experience is that everyone at the office acts like its the first time they've done a computer search. & they actually create their own 'issues' that they then cannot solve.
(if you look at the reply to this - exactly what I'm talking about. Present an issue, and they go off on some tangent - & don't seem to be aware of how they actually operate. no matter what problem you tell them - they will immediately put blinders on and act like there is no problem)"

What a joke of a company.

Customer service in fact Joseph so polite so professional take responsibility of the situation. Of course I am correct I am the customer how can he help me. Creates a case. They will do their best to have the driver, who seems is still in the area, to return and do the drop off. However they can not confirm. Customer service can’t and will not call us back to advise.

"WoW!
really amazed by their services! My sister sent me an urgent letter, paid the big price and arrived late, of course, cos they f***ed up at the warehouse, well, it ended up at the wrong warehouse. Sh** happens as they say, so I filed a complain and wanted a refund at least for all the troubles I went through and guess what? Because the packing slip was filed out by hands at one of their third party office, won't get my money back! Awesome!!
Apparently, you have to go online and print out a ticket, so in the case you get into troubles, like I, you can get your money back, besides that, forget it!
I have trusted Purolator twice in my life so far, and both times ended up getting ripped off! So thanks Puro, enjoy my money!"

LIES - package will arrive after we leave country, grand daughter sent gift to grandma that she will never receive.
They do not care about customers at all, ignorant CUN T on phone....no customer skills.
Do yourself a favour use UPS or FED EX....more reliable and customer friendly. Last time we ever use purolator. Surprised they still in business- one star is too much than they deserve."

"Theses Peoples Are Liars.
They are pathetic. From the person that delivers, to management and their customer service employees are the BIGGEST LIARS. They are all in it together.
Whatever excuse they give you regarding your package not being delivered is a lie.
They choose a list of package to deliver and the rest is not delivered Because they don't have enough employees.
This is the fourth time that this company does this to me.
I had an urgent package from Amazon. I choose the one-day shipping option. Purolator supposedly picked up the package around 9 am.
I am home all day waiting for it. Around 3 pm, I go online to see where the package was. '' it says it was delivered at the front door "".
I called Purolator immediately. The women I talked to, proposed to deliver the package another day without me explaining anything. She already knew that they never tried to deliver the package.
I got mad, she put me on hold and came back telling me that the package was not delivered because it was damaged, so the driver could not deliver it.
The same package they picked up just a couple hours earlier. Online on their website, it says ""delivered at the front door""
They are FU*KING LIARS.
Amazon reimbursed my order the same day and I should receive it tomorrow (Sunday - Prime one day shipping) with another carrier.
IF YOU ARE AN AMAZON CUSTOMER, YOU CAN ASK THEM NOT TO USE THESES A**HOLES.
Amazon made a mistake because I did ask them to never use Purolator again. But this time they did and it happened again > package not delivered.

"It does not surprise me whatsoever that when I searched for purolator reviews, 99% of them are negative. Minutes ago, I experienced what I have already experienced dozens of times in the last decade with shipments delivered by Purolator. I have been home all day today and literally just a few feet from my front door and somehow still missed the delivery of my package. For whatever reason that I will never understand, no Purolator driver has ever knocked on my door or rang my doorbell, EVER! It's like they walk up to the door with the ""Sorry we missed you"" notice already in hand, leave it on your door and then go about their merry way. It is so absolutely frustrating because the end result for me is having to drive half an hour away to 800 Kipling to pick up my package and then half an hour back home all because they can't be bothered to even attempt to see if somebody's home. When I called Purolator to find out the whereabouts of my package as well as inform them about this issue I've been consistently having with them over the years, I was told they were going to log a complaint against this particular driver. In my opinion that's not going to solve anything. All that will do is hurt this one person and possibly even put his or her job in jeopardy, that's not what I want nor does it solve the issue. If this is happening with all the drivers consistently across the board then clearly there is an issue during training or they are hiring people who just don't care. Purolator needs to take responsibility and take action to correct these issues because it is evident that I'm not the only one having them and punishing one single driver isn't going to fix their reputation. At this rate, Purolator may as well cut their costs and not have drivers at all, just make it a storage facility where customers can come pick up their packages since we've already been doing so for years."

"Unbelievable. They lost the mail and kept asking me to provide the tracking number. I gave it to them 3 times and the reply is always ""We need a tracking number sir"". How useless is that? Just insane, Purolator should be out of the mail business, they don't know what they're doing.

Not to mention they have a very small amount of outlets so you have to drive far just to pick up mail. ""Free shipping"" is fake news."

"I want to start off by saying Purolator is not a shipping company. They probably want you to think that. They try to act like it. But they aren't.

You see, this company doesn't understand what it means to be a shipping company. Cause you know, delivering things and being convenient are kind of what makes a shipping company a shipping company. My roommate and I, work opposing hours. There is only a small time frame where no one is home. And they constantly deliver at this time. Its a time where no one would usually even be home. On top of this constant worst timing, they only try once. You'd think; ""well okay, at least I can go pick it up at the postal office."" Nope. They're special. You have to go to their incredibly far and inconvenient warehouse to pick it up.

For where I am, the warehouse is in the middle of this industrial area with almost nothing around it. Walking there is almost impossible as you only have a road that stretches for a good twenty minutes. In the winter its especially bad as this road is barely taken care of, and you can't walk beside this narrow road as the snow is near 3-4 feet deep. So if you don't have a car like me, you can almost get hit just trying to get there. Even worse you need to walk through this overpass that only has just enough room to let a car get through.

After picking up my package, I decided I didn't want to do that horrible walk again, so I called a taxi. Well actually, I called about 5 of them. They all refused to come to that area. I couldn't even get an Uber. And the closest bus was 25 minutes away down the same dangerous road.

Unfortunately for me, I don't have a car, which is why i buy things online. Generally, big and heavy things that I can't carry with me. So this completely defeats the purpose of getting anything online. It defeats the purpose to even pay for shipping. So to me, this company isn't a shipping related one. Its a horrible warehouse.

You CAN call them to redeliver, which I have started to do. They won't unless you call them and ask politely though... However, they can still deliver at that horrible little time frame. Which they usually do. In addition, every time I have asked for them to redeliver, my items have generally arrived damaged.

So my message to this company, please stop existing or do what you're supposed to. I shouldn't need to have a car to pick up what YOU were supposed to deliver to my door. My message to anyone who has to deal with them, good luck. I wish you the best."
"Hi Soren, thanks for the review. If you can't be home to accept the delivery, you can leave a note with the tracking #, date, address, complete name and signature and the driver will leave the shipment at the door. We can also have it transferred to the service point of your choice or even change the delivery address of your choice, no extra charge, if serviced by the same depot. If you have any questions or would like to make such arrangement, don't hesitate to email us.

"THE WORST DELIVERY COMPANY EVER EXISTED. This is the second time I pay extra money to get something delivered in one day. I stayed home the entire time to make sure I get it. But the delivery person was apparently too lazy to get on an elevator up to the 12th floor. They didn't ring, knock or even call. They just put a little notice saying ''so sorry we missed you'' at 3pm, I got an automatic email at 3:20 telling me of their ''attempted'' delivery. RI-DI-CU-LOUS. HUUUGE waste of money and time.

"The Worst Courier Service Ever. I was supposed to receive a parcel from Amazon Canada. The worst company(Purolator) didn't try to attempt to deliver my parcel. I live in an apartment, and they never ring the bell or leave a door tag. Even they never send me an email or call (which all courier companies do) to receive the Purolator Office near to my place. And they send it back to their main office in Ontario. Then I call them to know the status of my parcel and Purolator employee said it's my fault and don't accept their mistake. Worst Service Ever, CANADA POST IS BEST.

Never trust the useless Purolator courier company for any letter or parcel, waste of money, time and then face their stupid and attitude employees."

"I have a really bad experience with this company. I was supposed to get my package on Wednesday but no one showed up, they just changed my package status to ""receiver unavailable"". I'd been waiting for them for the whole day so I called them. They said that the driver can't deliver it on Wednesday anymore so I arranged my delivery on Friday since they don't deliver on weekends.

On Thursday they attempted to delivery it to me but we agreed that the delivery would be on Friday so no one was home waiting for the courier. I called them again and explained the situation. They said that the delivery is scheduled on Friday and I have nothing to worry about.

Today is Friday and I'd been waiting for them to deliver my package for the whole day since 8 a.m. when I noticed that the status of my package changed to ""Available for pickup"". I called them and they said they made a mistake and put my delivery on Thursday instead of Friday. Really? But I called the company on Thursday evening to double check everything and they said it'd be delivered on Friday.

They can't deliver it today or on weekends but would deliver it on Monday. I lost 2 days already for nothing and have to wait the courier on Monday again.

My package is a mattress btw and I sleep on the floor because they can't deliver it to me. Very nice."

"I have had 2 shipments in 2 weeks ""delivered"" by puralator. First thing first. They deliver to my postal code but not to my address. The companies I bought from didnt know that and either did I. My first order went missing for 4 days. After which a lady from the resolution center called me and asked me for a redirect address. She proceeded to tell me that I need to canvas businesses in my town to be a depot for puralator after I had told her I started to chase this pkg even before it got lost.

She ended the conversation with as soon as you know the business has chosen puralator for delivery call in and give a redirect address.

We I did that. But puralator dropped the ball again. The pkg has been delayed because it went to the resolution center for undeliverable pkgs. She called again, to whom is really rude. When I asked about the redirect address she said well if we got one I wouldn't be calling now would I. I am so choked at puralator right now that my pkgs keep getting held up due to your incompetence. I will in the future make sure I or any of the companies I purchase from will never use you to deliver to or for me!"

"I had a 700$ item delivered yesterday (delivery time estimated between 8am-9pm. It arrived at 6:00pm. The man set the item on the balcony, rang and probably ran back to his truck because I was 3 secondes away from the door and he was driving away as I opened the door. Isn't there suppose to be a signature or paper left in the door rather than dropping a super expensive item for everyone to rob in front of the door? There should be an option to click and accept that the person wants to take a chance to receive item WITHOUT signature. Next time I see that Purolator is the one delivering, I will cancel my order. And I had NOT selected SNR, i had simply ordered and the SNR option apparently was the one selected by default...."
"Hello Jennifer,

Thank you for leaving this feedback. We're sorry for the concern caused by this situation.

Our service requires a signature upon delivery, by default. However, there is an option to waive the need to obtain a delivery signature. That option is called OSNR (origin - signature not required) or SNR (signature not required). It can be selected by the sender (OSNR) or by the receiver (SNR). In the case of a package sent OSNR, the driver will leave the package at the door, ring the bell to let the receiver know that a package arrive, and leave to continue his route.

If you do not wish to benefit from this option, I would suggest letting your senders know that you want us to obtain a signature upon delivery.

Should you have any further questions, feel free to email us directly.

"1 day Shipped a time sensitive package from Ontario to California with Purolator. They lost the package for about 4 business days (apparently this has happened before where packages don't get properly scanned into the system). I asked them to destroy the package as it was too late to deliver it and asked for a refund. I shipped on February 28th, package should have arrived at its destination on February 29th. It is now April 3rd, I contacted Purolator and asked when I would receive my refund and they said it will take 4-6 weeks for the refund to be issued...On a package they lost!

Will never use Purolator again, and if you want your package to actually arrive to its destination on time I would suggest using another carrier!"

"If I could give a score lower than one star I would. I recieved the notification that my package was on it's way on delivery at 7 am. I waited the whole day and had to take the day off work as I needed the package to actually put together a computer I am going to sell. I called four times after waiting for almost the entire day, after which they paged the driver and said it was urgent. They then said to call back if my package wasn't there by eight. Surprise surprise, they close at 8. The next day, after my new by delivery date is unknown, I called in. Once again, the package is on it's way. However, I can't take another day off work, so I have to print of a form and leave it on the door so that they will leave an expensive package on my step or else I have to pick it up tomorrow. I am furious with this company who obviously is too incompetent to keep in contact with their drivers while they're delivering or doesn't care enough about the customer to make an effort or provide their service properly. This has been my first time using Purolator, and now I will do everything in my power to not use them again and make sure everyone I know doesn't use them."

"I always order packages from Amazon, driver is too lazy to attempt delivery. They never deliver my packages, that's why most of orders gets returned back to Amazon, it's a huge loss for the company. if Amazon doesn't get rid of this company, they will loose revenue big time. I live in an apartment on the third floor, so instead of delivering my package to my apartment, the delivery person leaves the package outside on the street at building main door and update status as delivered; my package was stolen. I live in neighborhood where you have too many homeless and thieves. I called customer service and she was rude to me. I asked to file a complain about the person who never attempt delivery, and she told me that I am wrong, the delivery person is doing his job, and he didn't do anything wrong. She said Purolator doesn't have to knock on door or deliver to apartment, they can just leave it outside the building main door if signature is not required. I understand that most couriers like Canadapost can deliver to safe location if you live in a house and you can choose to have them not deliver to safe location regardless if signature required or not however Purolator does not operate that way. Most shipping companies will never leave packages in hallway of apartment building, you can't treat apartments like houses, it's against fire safety code to leave packages in hallway, so customer service rep need to be educated about that because today she was arguing with me that they can leave packages wherever they want. Also apartment buildings are not considered safe locations, so you should not treat it like a house and you should not leave packages anywhere in public view because packages are visible to anyone accessing the building, and can be stolen. Purolator workers are negligent, ignorant and rude. whether your customers live in apartment or house, they will just throw packages in unsafe locations and not attempt any delivery, then they will lie to you and tell you they attempted delivery, and if there is no signature required, they act like they are not responsible, they may as well throw your package in the garbage bin, and call it delivered. I advise any company that if you don't want to loose any customers or loose money on lost items or returned items, avoid this scam company, even they may have better deals or cheaper rates than other companies, in the long term, you will end up loosing more money because of the unprofessional service."

"Morons.

Didn't receive buzzer codes, so couldn't deliver, didn't leave door tags. I called in to see options, CSR is incompetent at best. They can't re-attempt next day, they can't redirect, their facilities and drop locations are few and far in between.

I have another package via amazon, and when I attempted to call in and add a buzzer code to that, their system was unable to update that information until tomorrow, so I'm to call back again.

What year are you people in? Are you aware there is technology that allows real time updates and provide information? Are you purposely trying to be bad so FedEx or UPS will buy you out?

I checked my porch and I couldn't find it. Then I went two blocks down to my other neighbors and I found the package.

first off your customer service reps a pure rude and useless, and i never write bad reviews but this company i have to.

so first i called Purolator to change an address on 3 shipments that were sent to the wrong address (not purolators fault at all)
so i called March 14th (Thursday) 3 times to have the new address and also Re deliver
they say it will go out Monday. im very OK with this . and i called 3 times got 3 different agents just to make sure everything was good for Monday
i call back the 16th(Saturday) Just to make sure again that everything is set for monday and im told Yes so i take Monday the 18th off work to be here
,
Monday i call just to be told it will be out for delivery Tuesday
WTH PUROLATOR!!! why have 4 Different agents tell me yes for Monday then now that im waiting its only out for Tuesday ?
that is pure BS and your agents dont even give a flying crap or try and find a solution .

and all 4 times i called all 4 times they had attitude and doesnt seem like they like working .

anyways fix your crap stop telling people things will get done when they are not"

Your trucks will pull up, and will start writing the notice before even leaving the truck... and then when there’s a notice saying how to buzz up, you’ll take that as us saying we’re not home.

You’ve done this to our unit and everyone else in the building. It’s disgusting and poor judgment.

Are you paid to leave notices or deliver packages?! Cause you’re all a joke!

You guys should be shut down!"

"Am I the only one tired of them sticking ""missed delivery notices"" on my doors and mail box. Each time I try and remove them they leave huge residue of glue everywhere. Tried to remove it and now it turned browned with paper towel stock to it. If I leave it there for a month it completely dries out and there's nothing to do. Am I supposed to hire a company to do it or completely replace my door. I called Purolator and they told me to go to Canadian Tire or something."
"Again, if I can, I'd give a zero star as well. Last year I had issues with them leaving my packages in the middle of my driveway and I had to carry them in myself. Then they threw my packages around, all caught on camera. This time the driver passed by my house without even attempting to deliver my package, which I was waiting all day for and then I got a notification that the receiver was unaccessible. I was home, no attempt was made and I saw on the camera that the driver just drove on past. Unacceptable!"

"I would give zero star if that was possible. Received delivery notification but my package never got delivered to my address. I have no clue where the driver left my package.

"Should have negative rating as an option! We bought many staff from Amazon lately and it was always sent by purolator. Purolator customer service has many different excuses to explain why they didn’t deliver our packages. First time said road condition was bad, the entrance of the building was blocked or even a deer died on the road, while we live in the city near a busy Main Street! We could even look out the window and the road was clear! Second time said no one home while we were home and we even left a note for the delivery driver in the building entrance said please buzz this code so we can come out, they didn’t even try to deliver our package, just said no one home and didn’t even leave a notice. Third time said the delivery person wasn’t familiar with our building location so he couldn’t deliver. And now after many lessons from them, I found out my recent package is still being delivered by purolator, I contacted them in the afternoon and they said they will try to deliver to us today, if they miss us they will send my package to the main center so we can pick it up ourselves tomorrow instead of waiting till Monday. Then I checked after I finished work, I saw that purolator stated attempted to deliver but no one home, and no indication where the package went. So I called again in the late afternoon and the customer service gave me a confirmation number and stated that the package will be at the main center for pickup. And now guess what? The website of purolator said they will attempt to deliver on Monday. Spoke to two customer services and have a confirmation number, they still do their own thing. Totally ignore what the customer requested. I recently found out that I can choose to send my package to an Amazon pickup point, I just choose that option because I don’t want to waste my time with this company. Every time I called them I would say if I have an option I wouldn’t choose to use purolator, and their customer service told me that “you are welcome to tell Amazon that do not use us.” Purolator, now as your wish I don’t use you! This is my last time that I need to deal with you! I hope I can get my package soon!"
"I have lots of examples of non-deliveries and no notification of attempts to deliver by Purolator. They were supposed to deliver a new credit card to me (address was my bank which has regular banking hours) and after 3 weeks I had to track down which delivery service the credit card company used and then contacted Purolator who said that they tried (but the bank was open and didn't receive!!!).
Purolator doesn't leave notifications of non-delivery - they just take them back to their depo and then return to sender.
Recently, the only way that I knew that a delivery failed was because Apple notified me, not Purolator!!! I contacted Purolator and it was supposed too be re-delivered yesterday ... it's still not here, and no notification.
Online businesses should not use Purolator.
Don't use Purolator!!!"

"a. Monday, Amazon sent Purolator tracking for delivery Wednesday by 8 pm.
b. Purolator tracking shows Monday pickup, sorting centre arrival, and sorting centre departure at 6 pm Monday. NO FURTHER TRACKING SCANS!
c. It is only 125 km from sorting centre to my home in Tillsonburg.
d. Yes, (after waiting all day) when the parcel did not arrive Wednesday evening, I emailed Purolator Customer Service with their tracking number.
e. It is Friday and zero response from Purolator Customer Service. Amazon's automated response is ""check back with us on the 15th""!
f. Amazon should stick with Intelcom. They are far more reliable than Purolator..

This upgraded rating reflects the quick Purolator response to Trustpilot and subsequent back-channel followup with me.
But my original March 6th e-mail to Purolator was via their customer service link on their website. If it was, in fact, eventually found in their General Mailbox on March 8th, then they have a problem with customer service communications...

Unfortunately, after initial contact with Candace at Customer Service on Friday, there is no further response.. My email on Monday morning requested Purolator to either update tracking or declare the shipment undeliverable. It is now day eight.

Final update: Amazon is shipping a replacement. Donna, at Purolator Customer Service, has found the $338 package. She says: ""the label fell off the package"". Ever try to remove a label from a box shipped from Amazon?"
"Hi John, thanks for the review. My sincere apologies for the delay. I was able to pull your email from the general mailbox. I'll have to open a tracing file so this can be located and delivered ASAP. The specialist assigned will contact you directly.

"Purolator should not accept rural customers if their drivers have no intention of even leaving a ticket when they decide they can't be bothered to make deliveries. It is much easier for them just to leave packages at the local store than it is to do the job they are paid to do. The same day Purolator dropped our packages at the store UPS came up to our house no problem... so did a full size school bus. The drivers can say whatever they want and customers have no recourse. My husband is a professional fuel hauler, we would never leave our driveway in an unsafe condition. Do you think the managers and supervisors at Purolator care that they are not providing the service they promise?? Nope! Meanwhile we have never once had this issue with any other courier or the guy who used to drive for Purolator. Pretty sad that you have to learn what a company is really like when an issue finally does come up. Save yourself a potential hassle and get Amazon to deprioritze Purolator on your account."

"1 stars instead of 0 because they actually attempted delivery!

But guess what ? Yes, right. PickUp location outside Montreal! It doesn’t even adds up to go pick up an item outside the town (Anjou or something)!

Contacted them, they agreed to reroute package in a location 20 min from me. “Tomorrow by 18H00”. You really need 36 hours to move a package ?

I urge everyone to apply the rule I’ll be applying from now on :
If vendor doesn’t say what delivery company is used and it’s Purolator : Call them directly and cancel order. NO ITEM IN THE WORLD is valuable enough do deal with this Purolator.

EDIT : Answering to Vanessa : You HAVE drop points just near me. You still insist to deliver it as far as possible from clients"

"Unbelievable !!!!
Not even they do not deliver the goods to you they now have a practice not to even leave the delivery notice on your mailbox if you live in a condominium building.Whatever is shipped to us via Purolator is being returned to the sender because we are not even informed that the goods are being held for us at their counter.
I tried to complain but the response was :
""Because there is personal information that would be placed on a delivery notification, our drivers are not required to leave a notice of delivery attempt at a multiple unit location......
At this point, we have provided sufficient information on our delivery practices and means of tracking shipments.""

"I purchase some stuff from Newegg and Dell, and both of the shipments goes with Purolator.
I received all the information and I always add my email for the notifications.
I received the 1st notification and the shipment confirmation, I was able to stay at home the whole day.
At 13h10 the Purolator Guy came into the door, dropped the little box from Newegg, never ring the door and left the notice paper.
I never understood why do they do that, I know that those boxes are huges and heavy, but at least give the chance to your customer to make a decision (I will be able to help him without hesitation).
I call them back and it was the same history, at the end I am going tomorrow to pick-up my things at the Purolator at Lachine.
No value added at all.....!!!!! and zero customer service satisfaction.

Update:
I will send you all the details Vannessa.

The history gets worst,
I went today to the place in Lachine (360 rue Norman), I showed the slip to the guy, I was thinking that the boxes will be super heavy, and they are not (I was able to pick all of them with my both hands).

I asked the guy in a very polite way, to verify in the system if there is another 2 boxes under my name, he starts screaming that only 3 boxes are marked in the slip and that he will not do anything else.

At that time, I just pick them and left.

We arrive at home and there was the other slip, and I will call since I will not go to the same treatment again.

I will share with our Dell representative all this, hoping that they will use Canada Postes instead.

I do not know how this people get any training (if they do) facing any customer."

"I ordered things from amazon twice the past 2 weeks. Both times Amazon chose this Purolator to deliver my items. Both ended up with huge dissatisfaction. Both incidents were identical. Let me do the run down:

1) Purolator delivery man arrived at my building not able to get into the building for whatever reasons. He did not attempt to look for my buzz code even though my buzz code can be found on the dashboard with my name on it. I was home waiting for the delivery

2) Delivery man left, did not put up any slips or anything

3) Next day, I check my order detail on amazon, and went into the tracking, and found out that the deliveryman claimed that my address was incorrect and not able to deliver my items.

4) I called purolator, the nice customer service agent name Roger answer and explained to me that because I did not put my buzz code in my address when making the delivery, deliveryman wasnt able to get in. I ask him why other companies like Fedex UPS DHL USPS CanadaPost all somehow found a way to get in, but why not Purolator. He couldnt answer.

5) The deliveryman simply did not bother enough to deliver my items, and tried hard to find ways not to deliver the items to me.

6) He did not leave a slip or whatever.

7) I asked the customer service agent if he could find put what time will the delivery occur the next day, he couldnt advise as deliveryman has tons of delivery to do. And the next option is to leave it to the purolator office which is a mile away in downtown which defeats the purpose of delivery. He couldnt advise more. I know this agent tried his best but he simply couldnt. And this item for some reason must have my signature to deliver, and for god sake its just essential oils and protein powder inside whats the big deal?

8) So now I have to stay home and wait for the delivery to come to me all day for the next few days until I receive it, because nobody knows when it will arrive to my place, when or what time.

This same ordeal happened twice and in the exact same fashion. It would be a problem solve if purolator can just adhere tot he delivery date which appear in the tracking, and have the deliveryman to look for the buzz code if not find a way to get into the building just like how Fedex UPS DHL USPS Canada post all have been doing. If not have more purolator offices in urban area based on population density and deliver the items there.

From now on, whenever I am have something delivered to me, I will call the merchant to NOT USE PUROLATOR!! Seriously, your delivery method and deliverymen (Plural) failed your company. If you cannot be on par with UPS DHL FEDEX USPS CANADAPOST then dont run a delivery business. I am so frustrated to even need to write here and having to call the customer service twice. Also there were no emails or notice from Purolator that my delivery encountered any delivery failure, not at all. If i didnt go to amazon, i wouldnt have known. And you can bet that I will go the great distance to ask my merchants to NOT using Purolator.

If you are a customer service agent reading this, I want you to know that you are doing a great job trying to resolve all problems, but it is delivery approach which is wrong and undermining the company."
"Hi Chris,

"I get parcels from these guy's through Amazon.I was suppose to get a parcel March 4th,2019 (the delivery date) and nothing. I waited all day for this parcel, come to find out the carrier was here and gone. This isn't the first time this as happened. Around 11AM my phone rang to the intercom, after 2 rings I answer it and say hello 3 times louder everytime...no reply...NOTHING..so did he just push the button and leave?? When I looked at the status of my parcel it said had wrong address..I never changed my address on Amazon for a few years now. When I called Purlator, they informed me the carrier tried to deliver at 6:10AM.(Riiiight) I never in my life received a delivery that early. I also didn't recieved a call on my intercom either because I would have heard it. The lady then asked me for my address. When I told her my buzzer number she said, Oh.I'll put that in there. I was like, what do you mean?? It never changed!!! SERIOUSLY? I know for a fact they had my buzzer because I HAD THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH THEM. I KNOW FOR A FACT THEY HAD THE CORRECT INFORMATION. SO FRUSTRATED. If I had a choice I would never use Purlator. Not only do they lie to you and make it out to be your fault the parcel wasn't delivered, but the delivery guys are rude. They give no eye contact, no smile...NOTHING even if you say, Thank You! They just hand you the parcel and leave and walk away. They also stopped leaving missed delivery papers. How are you supposed to know if your parcel arrived? What if you didn't have a tracking number. The reason being, they don't want someone else stealing your package and have your information. DON'T PUT PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THERE THEN. Canada Post don't have any issues. 1 excuse after another. It wouldn't surprise me if this carrier is next to be shut down. According to all the crappy reviews, you'd think it would be already. CALL IT QUITS ALREADY. THIS BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE!"

"Very poor service. On the Purolator tracking details, the package is ""On vehicle for delivery"" Friday at 2:18 pm. I wait home. The next morning, there is a paper on the door saying they came at 9:50pm. They did not ring. On the paper it says the package will be at a certain location, Saturday morning. This location is opened until 12:00 on Saturdays When I get there, I'm told they don't have the package. They will have it on Monday, not before. It is not the first time I have that kind of service from Purolator. How can they stay in business with that kind of service?"

"Garbage delivery service. My package was due 4 days ago. It was out for delivery, then a couple hours later was 'delayed due to weather'. It was a beautiful sunny day. The tracking was then not updated for 2 days, and once they did update they just said incorrect address. No other company seems to have issues delivering to my address. Once I called customer service explained it was the correct address, that there's even a backyard they can drop the package off in, she said that she would leave a note for the driver. Still wouldnt deliver. Didn't even leave a slip to know where to find the package."

"Puralator was supposed to deliver a parcel from Amazon today and I waited all day long at home to collect it. They never attempted the delivery but have updated the status as ""Incorrect address"" at 8:26 pm. So I called the customer service to check what was wrong with my address since I always receive my parcels correctly from other suppliers. They ask me to collect the parcel from a location 40 kms away or wait until Monday (4 days from now) to get it to the nearest Puralator office. Within a few minutes, the status has been falsely updated by Puralator as ""Attempted delivery - Recipient not available"" at 8:56 pm, while I am still at home wide awake. This is crazy and I can't believe why Amazon uses such bad suppliers."

"The level of incompetency of Purolator is completely indescribable. I had paid $150 to have a birth certificate expedited as it was crucial for a flight I had booked. The government office in Ontario did their due diligence but unfortunately as soon as it got into Purolators hands, that was not the case any longer. Even though my package was in Calgary on February 11, I did not receive any notice or phone call that something was wrong with my address until the evening of February 14. They had left a message explaining they were unable to deliver it because my apartment number wasn’t on it and to give them a call back. I called back within ten minutes with my tracking number and explained the situation only to be told that it was too late and it was going to be sent back to Ontario and there was nothing I could do. Feeling frustrated yet still optimistic, I called again on Friday morning and re explained my story to a women who seemed genuinely concerned for the whereabouts of my birth certificate. After a timely hold, I was informed that she was unable to intercept them sending it back as it left on the transport vehicle the previous night. Tuesday rolls around and I’ve heard nothing as well as my tracking number hadn’t been updated since the previous Thursday. I then call Ontario to ask if they’ve received it and low and behold they had not and convinced me this package was still likely in Calgary despite what I was told from multiple people. Upon contacting Purolator for a third time, I was then essentially told that they really didn’t know where it was but would get a “trace specialist” on it right away as I needed it to travel. About an hour later I get a call from this said specialist who is extremely short with me and really only tells me that it got sent back and that Purolator simply “forgot” to update the tracking number. When I told him that Ontario did not in-fact receive it yet, he agreed it was “weird” because it should have been sent via express. Feeling very discouraged, I then went and cancelled my flights that were not refundable or transferable totally $300. After a very emotional day, I decided to try and call the depot here in Calgary just for a peace of mind that this important and legal document had not been lost or gotten into the wrong hands and what do you know.... they’ve had this package sitting there for a week... this is completely unacceptable customer service and I am now missing one of my longest friends birthdays due to your lack of competency. This morning I had to take a taxi (I don’t drive) to the depot to retrieve this package that cost me an additional $65! I am at a loss of words for this entire experience and I will NEVER use your services again. Thanks for nothing Purolator 👍"

Not surprised at all, since the only two times (thank god) that Purolator has shipped my Amazon purchases, have resulted in failed deliveries, and missed deliveries (bullschitt, I was home the whole time, well-known fact that they don't actually attempt to deliver) with the recent one forcing me to call in to ask for the package to be moved within 50 km of me because Purolator thought it would be smart to move the package to a facility that would have required a 2 hour round trip by public transit or a 90 minute round trip by car. All that in mind, I live in Downtown Montreal, very close to the Purolator Downtown location. Purolator is a corrupt company, that is 91% owned by Canada Post, which in turn, is a crown Corporation, which is just another word for saying that it is owned by the Canadian government. It reeks of corruption and mismanagement. From hearing similar stories from friends and family, our only conclusion would be that these so-called ""lost packages"" are left in some big warehouse to rot, and/or illicitly sold for profit later on.

"Would rate 0. My package has been sitting at sort facility for nearly a week, and the package has been delayed for another week, why? So it can sit in the wearhouse for another week because the workers couldn't care what time they get delivered? Absolutely. while the same time I ordered from canada post and it's going to be here tomorrow. Contacted them 4 days ago, no reply still. Absolutely the worst shipping company period. My product apparently used purolator, which I would of never, ever used. Try to avoid at all costs, look for detailed shipping information before you buy something."

"Yet another delay by Purolator. I don't know why I keep paying for overnight shipping when they maybe deliver on that 20% of the time. This time I desperately needed something for a job over the weekend, paid for overnight shipping so I could have the part I needed, only to see it saying it was to be delivered on Friday by 8pm and then after nothing shows up, tracking goes to weather delay at Hamilton with an estimated delivery by Tuesday. Thanks guys, you just cost me this job because I was not able to deliver on a promise to a customer. Sounds familiar doesn't it?"

"worst worst worst reliability i ever seen.

been delayed 1 day at toronto for bad weather when roads where cleared (i did a Mtl - Tor - MTL that day as i am a mover did not find any spot on the road that wasnt on asphalt)(Purolator Network Weather delay - service will resume weather permitting)

after i see the package out for delivery at 7am , then at 2pm apparently package couldnt be delivered, (i guess the driver was too lazy as we are a friday)
Feb 15, 2019 2:30 p.m. Montreal (east/est), PQ Delayed in transit due to disruption
Feb 15, 2019 8:28 a.m. Montreal (east/est), PQ On vehicle for delivery

i usually make everything possible when i buy something online to NOT have it delivered by purolator because i only had problems with them, never been reliable, i guess you need to be lucky to have a worth it driver in your area.

Problem with purolator is mainly Staff, and believe me, when this assh*** will get there next monday(if he does obiviously, anything is good to avoid making the job), he wont have a good day believe me on that.


EDIT: PUROLATOR WHY ARE YOU STILL ASKING CUSTOMERS INFORMATIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS? IT IS A USELESS EFFORT TO MAKE PEOPLES BELIEVE THAT YOU DO RESOLVE SITUATIONS ? CUZ THERE IS NOT ONLY A FEW DOZENS OF BAD EXPERIENCE HERE BUT THOUSANDS !!! INSTEAD OF SPENDING RESSOURCES IN A PLACE LIKE HERE WHY DONT YOU DO SOMETHING TO MAKE YOUR COMPANY SOMETHING BETTER THAN A SH**HOLE ? i already contacted customer support and i had the most stupid answer ever, package could not be delivered because of backlog of package.... sorry but at 2pm in the afternoon this is nothing more thant a fu*** trash driver that wanted to not work too much a friday

remember... i also work into transportation i know what the job is and you guys are just a big cancer in the industry"

"It doesn't matter where you are, these guys somehow manage to be late, screw up where to send your package, don't want to come out to deliver the package because it's too far, etc.

I used to live out in Rural Alberta so I used to give some leeway but it was always the worst thing to see Purolator as the shipper, now that I moved into one of the two cities here, it's just as bad. They are the most incompetent comapny you could ever have to deal with, if you want something sent, use a different company, and if you are waiting to receive something, don't hold your breath, it will take forever."

"I’ve been using purolator over Canada post now for a few months and receive my package the next day every time. From Toronto to Sault Ste Marie.

Will only use purolator from now on.
Good job!"
"Just dealing with Puralotor and can't believe how bad the service is. Even though I left a note asking for the package to be left at the door (no signature required) it was not left. Then I called, and was told they would try and redeliver but after waiting 4 hours I had to call again to be told it was going to the depot, but to not expect it at the depot first thing in the am. In fact, there was no way of knowing when it would be available at the depot. As the package contents are perishable I feel like my life is on hold because of Purolator. I don't really understand, we live in a suburb of Vancouver, this should not be hard. The tracking info has not been updated since 2:45pm, so even that does not provide any information to the CUSTOMER. Going Fedex next time."

Was expecting a package from Purolator. Tried once to deliver then dropped it off at a pick up station over an hour round trip away despite there being on 10 minutes away in our town. No notice left at the door. A phone call two days later while driving where I needed to write down a 12 digit number to even find out where it was. By the time I sorted out who was shipping me this package and found a tracking number the thing was being returned to sender. When asked why they would not drop the package off at one of the three pick up stations in our town they advised me that they can’t have their drivers driving all over the place and that parcels are returned to the sorting area where it left from. Then why have pick up areas?! And if they did try to deliver my package then dropping it off at the local pickup area isn’t far out of the way. They don’t understand that they are a DELIVERY service!

"With the crappy weather we had in London Ontario yesterday, I expected my package to be late. When I saw the email notification stating that it was ""on the truck out for delivery"" and I would receive it by 8pm I was shocked. As I was out front of my house putting salt down on the walkway - the Purolator truck drove by. He didn't stop, he didn't slow down to look at the numbers of the houses, he just kept his pace and kept driving. When I thought to myself ""maybe, just maybe he missed it and thinks it's on the other side of the street"" so I waited. I waited. And continued waiting. And at 8pm I checked my tracking info and it said ""sorry your parcel is late, you will now receive it by February 14th"" I called their customer support this morning and told them what happened and I was answered with ""well, he was probably being lazy because of the weather."" Amazing. Absolutely top notch employees there Purolator. I would NOT recommend using this shipping method. You're better off with Canada Post, which is saying, well, quite a bit."

"Again, no delivery and no option of picking it up! I can't wait for another delivery company to be created that actually cares about customer service! Today for instance, yes there was snow, but it was predicted along with the timing, yet management did not make any accommodation for this, like starting the deliveries a little earlier or using a second vehicle so that ALL customers receive their packages. No they had customers wait all day and then cancelled delivery at 2:20pm due to weather. Hell unlike the complaints listed below they will not even allow me to pick up my parcel. The delivery truck also could have left the remaining deliveries at the purolator dealer here in town so that I could pick it up. Absolutely worst customer service!!!! of any company I deal with. I pray for competition!"

"Definitely worst shipping company ever! Poor management. No one is held accountable for their actions, from customer service to delivery people. Who ever is managing it is definitely not ranking customer satisfaction as a priority. No consideration to the customer, and always a lame excuse for non deliveries. They want the info of the incident and then that’s it, you never hear from them again and no solution either. No use complaining, just use other shipping companies.
(I dont know how to respond to reply so am just updatingthis reviewer include reply to company response:
You will look into it? Then what? Partially refund the $20 I spent for a non delivery? The store I bought the items from did not have an alternate shipping choice. I will no longer be purchasing from that store until they can offer me an alternative shipping company, and I will tell them so. You know, I cancelled all my plans and waited at home for the delivery. I even had a note on the door. My Delivery info states I wasn’t home. Not true at all. Driver didn’t even knock on the door."

"This is the worst delivery service by far. I am home every time I receive an email that says ""sorry we missed you"". They don't knock or even attempt to deliver. What kind of service is that? Might as well just say that the customer needs to pick it up without pretending to deliver. I don't think a car even comes by. They just say they do when in reality the post probably stays at their office. If you have alternate options go with another delivery provider."

Updated reply to purolator... yes we did talk via fb messenger and as everyone with a review here will understand, I was not at all happy with any “solution” given. They all benefit you and none of them worked for me, the customer. It’s unbelievable how crap your company is! I’d be ashamed to work for such a scam of a company.

"I’ve ordered things online for years and I’ve got to say Purolator has got to be the worst delivery company I’ve ever had the displeasure of using. I’ve had about ten things delivered with Purolator over the past two years and every single delivery was ridiculous. It comes down to two outcomes. Either the delivery person leaves my package unattended in my ground floor apartment hallway, just carelessly thrown on the floor near my door, or they don’t even try to deliver my item and just send it to a facility to be picked up. I’ve never had Purolator actually deliver a package to me. I always make sure to be home when I know a package is coming that day and not once did any of those times when I was expecting a package did the delivery person even knock on my door! The online customer service is a joke as well. It takes them days to reply to a message and usually it’s not even to help you in anyway. Just a waste of time. If you have the opportunity to choose another delivery company than do it. Don’t waste your time and money on them. It’s not worth it."

"Why can't purolator figure out a way to hold a package for me at the closest depot NOT closest depot in the city I live in. I live in Mississauga bordering Toronto - the closest purolator depot is 10 minutes away in Toronto yet all my packages get rerouted to depot 30 minutes away in Mississauga. Yes, they can sometimes reroute the package (which adds days to delivery) but often it cannot be rerouted unless the permission is provided by the shipper which is even more hassles... They always give me the same BS about packages being sorted by postal code - get with it - how about providing some customer service and figuring out a way to serve the customer!!!"

"The guaranteed delivery they tell you is a complete lie I've had 7 orders in the past 6 months with them and only 1 came when they ""guaranteed"" it would be there;usually it comes 2-4 days after that ""guaranteed date"", most of the time you have to waste time calling them to inquire when it will be there as they do not update their tracking site at all unless you call and ask whats going on then out of the blue it seems to update right as your speaking to them like you've called them on a mistake. If they didn't have a monopoly on this service with many retailers I would wash my hands completely of them."

"I scheduled a delivery for Monday, but I've changed my mind and called them Friday to say I was going to pick up the package myself on Saturday. They said it's ok, I shouldn't worry because the package would be there for pick up.

So I hired a private delivery car to get the package with me. It turns out that, on Saturday, the package status changed from ""Ready for pick up"" to ""New schedule arranged"". Clearly someone forgot to inform the staff that I was going to be there on Saturday.

Since I can't be the entire day available at home on Monday, I'll have to rehire the delivery car to get my package, because Purolator can't schedule a delivery in a specific time of the day nor weekends.

I'm very disappointed with this first experience with them, and I also lost money because of that."

"Very disappointed with my experience with Purolator. I was supposed to receive my package TWO days ago. Yesterday I called someone at customer service and they told me that my package would be re delivered between 8am and 3pm so I got up at 8am and waited all day in the window for the truck to arrive, I was afraid they would show up when I wasnt watching and then leave .... but it is now 6:24pm, & I have NOT RECIEVED ANYTHING! I called customer service again and spoke to a very nice lady. She was helpful. Up until I was told that they would get in contact with the delivery agent but could not reach him. They told me they would try to contact him ASAP and find out where my package was and they would email me back... I didn’t receive any emails. And I just checked the Purolator tracking site and it says my order is ready for pick up... I PAID FOR DELIVERY. They DIDNT even ATTEMPT to re deliver it today... VERY disappointed and will NOT be using purolator again or ordering anything that ships by purolator.

EDIT:
It is now the next day.... I couldn’t wait 24 to post another review so here’s what they decided to do... they emailed me and decided to CLOSE THE CASE. Are you f**cking kidding me? I was told that they were going to re deliver it but they didn’t even attempt to!!! I specifically PAID for two day shipping and all I get is one attempt and then a lousy email? How f**cking hard is it to put it on a truck and call me saying the driver is on the way?! Unbelievable. Worst shipping company ever! DO NOT USE! I wish I could give it 0 stars.

"Personally, this is just a critic for this courier. It's been a mess waiting for a delivery that I ordered on Sunday with one day shipping and it's almost Friday, yet to receive it.

I have spent the week every morning on the phone with very professional and helpful attendants but their updates to my location, packing and such have remained not updated in the system, leading to delayed deliveries, failed attempts and so on.

I have decided to pick up my package myself in Vaughn, probably going to spend money on a Lyft or on additional bus fare in the cold.

I wouldn't mind if the package was left at my front door...

Please can you devise a way for your drivers to communicate with people expecting deliveries because it's the 21 century. No way people dont have phones. All this could be avoided with a call that they are on their way to deliver.

Basically hoping I get my suitcases before my trip in 12 days...."

"To preface, I've used plenty of couriers. Mostly, I dealt with Canada Post, but occasionally FedEx and UPS. Never had a problem with any of them.

I can think of two times Purolator has messed up badly. The first was regarding a medical cannabis delivery. Signature was required, but instead they left it outside. I guess our dog signed for it. Good move. This was before October 17th, making it an even juicier target for the druggies on our street, who broke into our car twice looking for pills.

Switched to Canada Post after that, which was thankfully another option from my licensed producer.

My more recent gripe is over an Amazon delivery. Like others who posted their stories, I never received a package that showed as delivered. Called useless customer care. Was told that you guys simply hide the packages if nobody's home. I was shocked, but having worked in a call centre, I didn't want to blow my top at the person speaking with me. I knew it wasn't her fault.

It was Purolator's fault. I seriously have to ask, though, what kind of policy is it to leave packages outside? Other couriers put a note on the door.

Then there's the issue of the delivery status. The girl on the phone put a trace on the package, but it came back that it was scanned and delivered. Obviously, that wasn't the case. Given the frequent theme in these reviews, I'm 99.9% certain that the driver was lying and simply didn't want to walk to our front porch.

I'm not sure what motivates these people to be so lazy, but Purolator needs to scrap whatever policy compels the drivers to cut corners. Obviously there's a benefit to it for them.

I remember reading this review about a person who missed their medication and was suffering severely for it thanks to a fake delivery. The response from ""James"" (or whoever) was appalling.

""So sorry to hear about your experience, etc."". It was basically a carbon copy of the other ""apologies"" on here. How can you be so apathetic? This poor individual was suffering because of some driver who needed to rush his/her deliveries.

Such a disingenuous apology. Shame on you. Absolutely selfish and disgusting. No accountability on any level.

I don't really expect a resolution. They tried to find the package, but the driver's lies covered it up. Now I'm going to call up Amazon and get this sorted on their end. Thankfully it wasn't an expensive item.

P.S. Trustpilot, please allow a zero stars option. Purolator makes it necessary."

"Definitely the worst courier company out there from their extremely rude customer service rep to the review reviewer they are all fake don’t even actually help you. Customer service rep was tryna help me with redirecting my package to one of their locations near me and the driver continually “tries” to deliver to my building and not even walk up the stairs to see someone is their to let them in. Still hasn’t bin sent to the location, garbage service absolutely garbage."
Purolator left my package in the snow in -53 degree weather. $2000 in computer parts. This is a complete joke.

1 star cause I couldn't give it 0. The driver never came to my door. I don't know and will never know if he left the package in the building entrance or left with it but it was never delivered. I got a refund from Amazon they did the right thing but I was interested in the products I ordered. And their rude customer service representative calls me to say it was delivered! I spent over 40 minutes waiting to speak to a customer service representative for what? A month ago I ordered again from AMAZON and purolator left the package on the front door in the streets! If you have the option go with DHL or Canada Post.
"Hello Boneka,

We apologize for the inconveniences. If the shipment has the 'Signature not required' service, it should be left at a safe location and not on the street. If possible, can you please email us the tracking numbers? We'll report this incident to local management.

"Every time my online purchase is scheduled through Purolator, they find a reason not to deliver. From not enough drivers to make home deliveries to no building entry code provided. If the driver would have gone to the door he/she would have learned that our building supervisor is at the front door to receive packages, or use the last name to contact the receiver. Every other delivery company has no issues delivering to our building."

"This is the worst delivery service l.have ever had the.misfortune to use.

I used them twice without success. The first time l tried to deliver my son's keyboard to his Vancouver address. It was not delivered and l was.not notified of the fact. Finally , several months later l was able to track the parcel down to the Vancouver Airport depot and stood there until the staff finally found it. I then took the keyboard by taxi and delivered it personally to my son. Recently l again tried to use their services to send two pictures to Arizona.Again they were not delivered and again l was not notified. When l filed a lost claim l was informed that the pictures were damaged but the company did not take responsibility for shipping products that contained glass even when they had packed the goods. I would not recommend thzt anyone use their services."

"I work at home and I order electronics from many companies and when they use purolator I usually have problems with them. 80% of the time they screw up. Last one, they left a notice of delivery saying that i could pick up my parcel at this address in town. I go to the address showed in the delivery notice and they say that the parcel was returned to the central which is in another town. as simple as writing the right address to pick up, these guys can't seem to be able to do it. This is one story out of more than 10 that I have with this company. If i could i would never use it but other companies keep on using Purolator."

"Wow. Found this as I have a package that arrived in my small town on Monday and was supposed to be delivered today. The tracking info just says ""Delay in delivery due to external factors"". There is no snow on the ground, it takes literally 10 minutes to get from anywhere to anywhere in this town. No idea what the ""external factors"" could be. Based on the other reviews, Purolator has some serious issues. This is the first time that Amazon's delivery date was missed, also first time they used Purolator. I'll also add my voice to Amazon regarding everyone's apparent displeasure."

"Edited: Thank you for your response, Vanessa. I've done as you suggested and hope for a resolution. I'll update my review as appropriate.

I'm a patient person. For some time now, I've avoided deliveries sent by Purolator because I've almost never had anything delivered by Purolator ... each and every time, I end up walking to the Purolator office about 20 minutes away. If I wanted to walk 40 minutes for an item, I would simply go to the stores, wouldn't I? But ... I keep forgetting that Amazon sends some of its 2-day delivery parcels with Purolator. The last time it happened, I had to leave town after the scheduled delivery date so my parcel was returned. This time, I've received 4 or 5 messages saying my address is incomplete (it isn't) and therefore Purolator is ""having a problem delivering my parcel."" In the meantime, 2 other parcels from the same order have been delivered by different carriers. If this doesn't change, I'll cancel my Prime membership when it expires. In the meantime, I've stayed in for 3 days to make absolutely sure someone is at home for delivery. The problem, I'm guessing, is that the Purolator delivery person won't come to an apartment building without a buzzer number, even though our buzzer is the same as our apartment number and always has been. If this is a Purolator efficiency policy, it sucks."
"Hello Lori,

"Ordered a package from Amazon. Received the notification that it was shipped then delivered. Got home the package was not there. Called they said the driver dropped it off and received a signature. No one was home so now added to dealing with this issue I have to investigate and see which one of the kitties is a shape shifting mutant who can open doors and write. I called Amazon they said it was delivered with a signature as per Purolator's records. They refunded me the cost I reordered and had it shipped to my work address. The packaged showed up a day later than Purolator said it would be delivered. To top it off the package was cut open the sides of the box had large holes in it and the items inside were hanging out. It was also delivered to security on the main floor and not on the 8th floor as per the instructions on the package slip. Driver forged signature said I signed for it and he left the package on the 8th floor. Called the head office to complain and I was told it was up to me to accept or decline the item though I clearly indicated to the manager that it was not delivered to me directly. Both managers I spoke to said there is nothing they can do. They can schedule a pick up and I will have to deal with Amazon about the item. No apologies just, and I quote ""These things happen. There is nothing we can do about this. You will have to contact Amazon and re-order the item. You should not have accepted it in the first place if the package was damaged"" No apologies no investigation nothing. Thank you Purolator. My business I will take elsewhere."

"Laziest driver ever!!!The service I got was literally unacceptable. I had been stayed at home for two days and waited for my parcel. I provided my buzzer number after I churchased. In the first day, I didn’t get any call. The drive just left a tag. Then I realized maybe it’s complicated to get buzzer for them, so I called to deliver again. I left two notes. One on my mail box with my buzzer number. Another one on my door, just in case I’m not home, they could simply leave the package by the door. What I got was the phone call from automatic machine and telling me to pick it up. There wasn’t even a delivery attemptation. I found the company totally being dishonest and disrespectful. There is a reason for me can not pick it up myself. Is it the service you always provided by fooling your customers around?"

We were moved before but we moved back in this address almost a year already and we have no problem of receive shipment by other couriers. How come your driver work by imagination and work in the past??

Worst service and customer service. Dropped items off at beginning of December to be delivered and decided to cancel because they screwed up the first delivery. Called and they said it had been cancelled and can come pick up other remaining packages the next day. When I showed up none were there...it has been well over a month now with the company not being able to track any packages. whenever I call no one knows whats going on and now for the last 5 days they have said the packages should be in but everyday I call before picking them up they are no where to be found. Filed for insurance return and they will not pay what products are worth. WORST experience and will never use or recommend. And ruined 10+ Christmas gifts.

I ordered medicine and it was on the way with purolator. However it missed its connection and is 2 days late. I am now having severe anxiety and episodes of panic. I desperately need my medication and it has still not arrived and i have been unable to get any guarantees about the time of arrival. My condition is serious and the fact that i cant use the medication that i BOUGHT because of this tardiness is unacceptable. This delay has affected my physical well being and i must say if anyone ever needs anything delivered urgently do not use purolator.

"Just before Christmas I was waiting for a package with toys that were presents from “Santa”. I have a ring door bell that captures video of anyone that walks onto my porch. I see the Purolator delivery man bring the box to my porch, take out his note pad and begin writing a “sorry we missed you” notice. He did not bother to knock or ring the door bell even though someone was home. Instead it was brought over to a depot that is over 15 minutes drive from my house. To make matters worse I wanted to call customer service to complain of this incident, only to be on hold for one hour, finally get someone and then after 5 minutes get disconnected! Took another call (and another 40 mins on hold) to get them ATTEMPT to deliver to another depot that was slightly closer but at least kind of on my way home. They told me it was to arrive the next day. The next day, no package at that depot, the following three days no package. Call customer service again. They told me it’s christmas so they are busy. Is that even an excuse? They told me that they can see the request but the depot just hasn’t got to it. Took another call and speaking to a supervisor before i guess it received priority to be shipped to that depot the next day. Puralator you really dropped the ball on this one and failed to do the only reason you were hired."

"On Jan 9th Purolator tried to deliver to my new address but gave up since my name hadn't been added to buzzer list (apparently drivers don't have phones so a simple call is beyond their capabilities). Since then, I've contacted them every day view chat or facebook to change the delivery method to pickup for a downtown Toronto location. They've ignored every single one of the requests. Jan 10th they tried to deliver but I missed the buzzer due to work. Jan 11th they didn't buzz or leave a final attempt slip (very doubtful they even tried the last attempt). Come Jan 14th they give me an automated call telling me my package is available for pickup in ETOBICOKE. Clearly, their customer service department has no bearing on what the sorting depot does as the package has been handled as if I had made no complaints/requests. Unsure why they offer the ability to change to pickup and specify location since trying to use that service doesn't actually do anything.

"I ordered from herschel company and they used Purolator to deliver my package. I signed to get updated via text about the status of my package. I ordered it by 10th of January and supposed to be delivered the following day. According to the text update at 3:46pm of January 11 that the Item was not delivered because there's no entry code. Why didn't the delivery guy call me and he didn't even left a note in our lobby. I phoned the customer service Saturday morning to rectify the issue since I cannot edit my address on your website. the lady I talked to said, the earliest delivery would be 15th of January which I think is ridiculous!

"I'm talking to Amazon customer service as I write this review. Complaining about Purlator + asking them to never use them for my deliveries again. Problem: faking attempts for delivery. At my residence we have a locker service for couriers to leave packages to residents in a secure place (similar concept to Amazon lockers). They never use them, unlike other real couriers like DHL, UPS etc.

Infact, they told the property management office that they ""don't do that"". Instead, they leave notes on the gate which gets filled up with their notes. Good job advertizing your useless for all to see uselesslator"

"We ordered a bed from the Bay and it has been in our city for 5 days and still no attempt at delivery. We have contacted customer service multiple times and all we've gotten is a response that they will ""email"" the local delivery Depot to arrange delivery, and still NOTHING. The delivery has been flagged as a heavy item at 100lbs, so I guess it just sits there with no one willing to deliver it. We've even offered to pick it up and have had no helpful communication. Every day (for 5 days) the tracking says ""arrived at sort facility"". How many times can the same package arrive at the same place and no one delivers it?
Why accept parcels that you cannot/will not deliver?"

"I will never ship via Purolator but have had several experiences when companies use them ie: Amazon. I live in an apartment and, not once, has the driver walked up to buzz my suite and be let in. The cards are stuck in various on the outside of the building where someone will just happen to find them. Yesterday, I waited all day for a shipment, from Amazon, that I had paid extra to have expedited. No one tried to deliver it, yet, I receive an email, at 4pm, saying I wasn't home. Infuriated, because the same thing happens, with Purolator, every time, I called the so called ""Customer Service"" line. After being on hold for over 20 minutes, I was told that she didn't know what happened and the package was at a Purolator office located over 30 mins from where I live. There is one 5 mins, from me, so I asked why it would not be dropped off there. It was a very non chalant and unapologetic response.
Today, I drove over 30 mins in traffic to find out that the package was at the location 5 mins from my home. I asked for a phone number to speak to someone to file a complaint. Apparently, there isn't one, just the fantastic Customer Service line where they couldn't care less.
I will continue to share my experiences, with companies like Amazon, as they show impressive customer service for things that aren't even their fault. They, also, may, eventually rethink their shipping choice. Maybe Purolator will care more about the customers then"

"one star is like 1000 star too many. Purolator is the absolute worst courier service since the invention of mail. Somehow they managed to strike deals with online retailers so we have NO CHOICE when it comes to who deliver things to us. They probably achieved this by offering lowest rate, but this also mean they probably hire the least qualified staff and overload their infrastructure. From repeated experience, it is clear that they rarely even attempt to make delivery at condos/apartments if they dont see buzz code. They rather make up BS on tracking ""attempted delivery - no answer"" and drop it off in a nearby depot (in the wilderness where they can afford space) for you to pick up. customer service agents online or via phone also just repeat tracking info to you and say they will open a case and callback, which they never do. one day or 2 day delivery is a MYTH with purolator. Canada Post on strike deliver regular parcel faster than Purolator's so called one day delivery within the same city. One day just means their driver mark down the parcel as delivered but it's clearly not going to show up for another few days. You can call customer service all you want but after 30 mins of wait they will just say ""but it says delivered... did you check the bushes?"""

"UPDATE: Shortly after I posted this review, I was contacted by Purolator who did everything they could to resolve my issues. I'm glad to say that my faith has been restored with Purolator. The problem stemmed from a change of the local Purolator depot - it hasn't been a seamless transition; consequently a lot of confusion has occurred.
My only gripe now is that the information provided online; such as hours of operation for their dropoff/pickup locations, has not been reviewed for accuracy, obviously causing inconvenience to whoever is picking up or dropping off packages.

Purolator used to be my courier of choice - now I'm going to steer clear. Undelivered packages, untraceable packages and packages ready for pickup but don't know where to pick up! Even the LiveChat was cancelled on me because there were no available agents!!!"

"I had two terrible experiences in the last one month. The first parcel was attempted for delivery but nobody was at home. Instead of taking the parcel to the nearest Purolator office as shown on their door slip, it was taken to another city. I had to make multiple trips to get the parcel in my hands. The second one was scheduled for delivery for Jan 3rd but still not arrived. Terrible service!!"

"I would rate negative stars if I could. I have had nothing but trouble and terrible experiences from this joke of a courier. Times where I order the one day shipping but STILL get the package after over a week and half later. I have also had numerous times on occasion that the doorbell is not even rung. They simply leave the package on the doorstep at disposal of anyone to steal. (I have actually had one of my packages stolen from this, might I add.)

If a website had an option to get a boy on a bike to deliver my package instead, I would take that over Purolator in a heart beat. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this terrible company."

"Waited for my package to be delivered. Knock at my door and not even 15 seconds of them knocking they are gone. My package was delivered in the middle of the hall I. Front of my door opened , the seal completely cut down the middle and the box torn. Better yet, my books were damaged and filthy. The shrink wrap it was in was broken and the sticker on the bag says non refundable. If you go through amazon be sure to tell them to not use this service."

"I don't know how this company is able to stay in business! ""no notice of delivery attempt"" seems to be a common theme. Items are just left at a certain facility, often too far from where I live.

"To start with, I had very bad experience in this company. I was expecting package, so I had to check my tracking number on their website. They said my address is incorrect multiple times!!! I called them give them corrected address even though they had in their system.They told me they need my buzz number. Second day I stayed home all day waiting for my package and looked online. All over sudden the tracking page says ""attempted delivery"" was posted... but no one buzzed and no one left a paper at the front door.
I have to call them all day with representative after representative trying to understand where my package is. Finally they told me the location of the package. Then I asked them to reschedule for the shipment then they said I would have to wait 4 days to have the package delivered unbelievable!. It's already delayed by a week and I couldn't trust them anymore so I picked my package from random location!"

"I had a very negative delivery experience with Purolator. I made a request for next day delivery and was given a quote. The package was picked up, it was then misdirected and arrived at it's destination four days later. I spent many hours on hold in an attempt to find out where the package was. Upon delivery it was paid for as that was the arrangement. The payment was the quote that I was given for next day delivery. I have now received three notices demanding payment. I called customer service and once again was put on hold. I was offered an option to use Live Chat. Live Chat does not deal with accounts. Overall, this has been a very dissappointing experience."

"Today I was suppose to receive a package, I stayed the whole day at home waiting for it, and Purolator said that the customer was unavailable.

Pick the phone motherfukers! Why are they still in business??
"Didn't think things were as bad as the reviews said they were. I was wrong. Apparently if I want my item I need to make a half-hour (each way) trip to the ""nearest"" Purolator facility even though there are multiple other Purolator outlets in my area.

Julie H. on customer chat didn't bother to help or provide any suggestions. She even shut down the chat immediately after sending the standard survey link, which made me unable to take the survey. Customer service at it's finest. Just launched a complaint with Amazon regarding this. Hopefully if enough people can tell them about their awful experiences with Purolator they'll reconsider when it's time to re-negotiate their shipping contracts."

"So I stayed home from work today to receive a shipment from Purolator, only to watch the driver get out of his truck and leave a pickup notice on my apartment lobby's door without ringing the bell and then just drive away!

The notice says I can get my items if I pick them up in a different city at a warehouse that isn't even accessible by public transit!

How they can possibly call themselves a delivery company if all they do is drive around the city handing out pick up notices?

Total waste of my day for 100% unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour."

"This is the first time I ever received terrible service. I ordered a package at Henry's and the expected date of delivery to arrive at Jan 2 but still got nothing. I checked my e-mail and only got a notice that my package is supposedly on the way but when I checked the Purolator site, I saw that they put my delivery on hold as they got the Attention Alert notice.
It said I need to update my address or do an address correction when I already made the correct input so I contacted the customer service.
And they told me that they cannot make a delivery without a buzzer code but I do not have one. I never gave my buzzer code to any carrier before and they still managed to get their delivery done. What made me mad is that they could have sent me an email regarding this issue. If I did not check on my package, I wouldn't know about it. And also, they gave me the tracking late as well so I could only see it until recently.
Now, they expect me (a person with no car) to go travel for 1 hour to get my package at one of their pick up location. It'll be fine if I only got a light package. But now, I have to carry a 'printer' back home.
Nice. Thanks Purolator.
Will never take your service ever again.
And my package is supposed to arrive this Friday now. Hope they do not mess this up.
Definitely the worst experience I had so far.
Poor service and lazy staff!!!"

Delivery scheduled for New Year's eve...I guess the driver just wanted to take the afternoon off because he dropped my package off at a regional pick-up point instead of delivering it. Pretty lazy and now I have a 30 km drive to pick it up in the new year. This is not service!

"Please do not use them. They are really bad. They do not call you when they deliver(the buzzer in my building is not working and I cannot do anything about it) and they are generally extremely unhelpful. My goodness, we are living in the 21st century and one would have thought that at least trying to call the addressee is common courtesy. Better experience with UPS and even Canada Post (who would have thought so). After reading all the reviews here, I am honestly worried if I ever gonna get my package.

EDIT: When you try to set up the pick up location, the redirection on the site does not work. I tried three browsers. Works in none of them. The lady from the customer service told me they are going to take the package to London (but I am in Ottawa and do not have a car). She was not very helpful.

EDIT: Talked to the 2nd customer service representative, the lady was more helpful and helped me find and set up the pick-up location that is closer to my home. Let's see when and if I actually get the package."

"Can't rate zero. If I could, I would.

Often times Purolator says they attempted delivery (when I was home) and there was no note or anything. Packages are returned to Amazon as there is no bloody easy access place for me to get them.

Husband picked up one item, this time at Christmas as it was important - went to the depot, were told all packages are in a van that will be parked SOMEWHERE in the big mall parking lot. SOMETIME after 4.?!?

Any of you want to punch these CSR's who keep replying it was busier than usual this time of year?

Firstly, f*@# you PUROLATOR and your form CSR responses. Everyone I see attached to a post telling similar experiences to my own feels like a charlie horse on a bruise.

I've asked AMAZON to stop using Purolator. They still do, and usually those packages get sent back. And I complain again.

Eventually, they will listen if most people tell them about this issue. Amazon is partly to blame!

So, even if it's just a quick email to amazon, let them know about Purolator the next time you experience their ""service"". EVERY OTHER DELIVERY COMPANY HAS ZERO PROBLEMS DELIVERING TO MY HOUSE. I MIGHT get 1/6 packages that Purolator ""delivers"".

Vanessa A., F off. James, you are illiterate, F off. Do not bother to respond to this in any way as there is literally nothing you can do to make me think Purolator is anything other than the biggest piece of sh!t company I have dealt with. Happy New year! Hope your company crashes.

If Canada Post owns this company, then it must be where it sends the people that need to be fired but can't be due to union laws. Because my Canada Post service is awesome!"

"Not only did they initially lose my time-sensitive package of legal documents but according to their tracing department, they had given me the wrong tracking number. So when I had asked what happened to the package I sent on December 19 that was supposed to be there the next morning before 10:00 am (as per their guaranteed express delivery that I forked out for) they insisted it was delivered on December 7. I'm not making this up. After arguing with them and insisting that it had only been sent on December 19, they sent the case to the depot in Toronto, where they finally found it and delivered it on the 21st. Too late, because by then I had to have all the docs redone and sent again asap, though this time I used Fedex and there were no issues."

"Amazon employs Purolator to deliver some of their parcels. In my case they deliver it to a location that is 1/2 drive from my home. This is not delivery at all. My only expectation of a delivery service provider, is that they deliver. No apologies, no excuses, just deliver the package. If the trend becomes that we all pickup our packages at a central location, thats cool. But it's not delivery. Purolator representative I spoke to passed the buck, deflected and blamed others. Ended up cancelling my Amazon order after 2 hours of driving and 1/2 hour on the phone.
UPS delivers right to my door ."

"Purolator has been my WORST experience for Christmas. AVOID. Apparently they tried to deliver my parcel at my address on the 24th BUT they did not have my apartment number so they could not leave the package unattended. They just left a notice saying that ""we tried to deliver your package"". However, I checked on my order tracking and I DID mention my apartment number in my order. How stupid is that? So I called the company to ask when could my package be delivered. I provide all the information AGAIN orally to ensure the delivery. The lady ensures me that it will be delivered on the 27th. So here we are, the 27th of December, still without my package. I wait the whole day for the delivery which frustrates me so I call back. Oops! Purolator apparently STILL wasn't aware of my apartment number and the door access code! Good job Purolator! Might as well not enter my adress assuming you won't deliver sh#t! To make it even better, the last caller even blamed me for not providing my apartment info when they had it from the beginning! Never again ordering from this company.

I placed an order from Amazon for an elderly couple for Christmas. The shipment was broken up into three deliveries. One was yesterday with ANOTHER COMPANY. The could not find the house and called me immediately. The successfully delivered the package. Today the the rest of the 5 items were to arrive. They did not . I did not receive a call until after they tried to delivered. I had previously contacted Amazon to correct they error and they stated they had and deliver was assured today. A very rude woman from Purplator called and assured me that MAYBE it could be delivered before Christmas and stated that Amazon did not contact they they only had email from Amazon and she was not sure if they had contact as they do not check their email regularly .....really I trust Amazon and am so proud of the other service who took the time at time of delivery to ensure their companies good name and service.

"Don't who why this carrier is still in the business and why some retailers are still using it. Sometimes they never tried to deliver but the tracking records said they did. Liar.
I am not complaining that you are not doing a 2nd attempt, though all other carriers do. You never tried. This following happened to me twice: The package is address to a GTA city but their record says they tried in Barrier to deliver and was not able to. They asked me to picked it up in Barrier. Hey I am in GTA and of course you can't find my address in Barrier and that's why you can't even leave a notification slip for that!"
"They delivered my package to the wrong address and won't accept any responsibility for it.

Edit: haha Catherine, your company is a joke. Already done but I have proof you didn't investigate anything before closing my case, I also have proof your company did NOT deliver my package to the right address like you said they did. A disgusting excuse for a company and I will tell EVERYONE who will listen. You can have further contact with my lawyer."

"I have never experienced such an irresponsible delivery service. The item arrived broken. It was smashed on one corner. Even the inner box was broken. The Purolator driver backed into my neighbors garden moving a huge rock and knocking down a tree. The neighbor heard the crash and ran out calling; but, the driver drove away. Purolator said they would pay for a new tree. Unacceptable! I am 70 years old and can not move the rock back in place, can not dig up the old root, do not have a truck to transport a new tree and can not plant a big tree. Purolator's solution is not acceptable

The first attempt to deliver the parcel failed as nobody was home to sign. I arranged for the delivery to be sent to the neighbor. The message was not given to the second driver and when the neighbor ran out to get the package, the driver complained about ""not being told"".

All in all, a horrible experience. If there was a rating less than one star, I would have chosen it."

"I have been waiting for a package since Friday. I stayed home all day just to make sure I get it. They didn't bother calling or buzzing, just left a note telling me to pick it up at city square on Monday. So I went there on Monday and the package wasn't there. I called customer service and they told me they would send it to my home on Wednesday, which is today. I called them to ask when it's coming and guess what, they said it's not coming today. I can pick it up at UBC. So after wasting 3 days of work just to wait for a package,now I have to go all the way to UBC??? Well, they said again they could ship it to my place but it could take 1-3 days. I am just very disappointed about the service and will rethink my judgement of Canada Post. Very poor and unreliable!


Thank you Purolator for the standard automated reply! Very thoughtful of you, yet nothing is going to change. Who is going to pay me for the hours of work I lost waiting for you and chasing the package around the city????"

They just send a letter or email saying ""you owe money"", but to save their money, you have to log into your account to see what you owe. Every other company emails the invoice. My non-profit organization rarely uses a courier. I used it twice, and never got a bill. They sent my $59.57 account to a COLLECTION AGENCY, rather than taking the time to contact me and follow up re: the outstanding amount. If anyone can recommend another courier company, I am looking for a new one."
"Hi Wendy, we'd be glad to help you set your account for online billing so you can receive an email to inform you that your invoice is ready. We can also make sure we do have an email for you and that is it the correct one. Regardless of the amount, if an invoice is pass due and the reminders have been ignore, the account will be put on Stop Service and will be sent to collection so we can receive payment for the service provided.

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

"MUCH BETTER THAN CANADA POST!
In my experience Purolator ships fast, plus they don't go on strike every week like Canada Post does. They must treat their employees better over at Purolator.
Thank you, Purolator, for doing your job! I wish more companies shipped their products with Purolator instead of Canada Post! ;D"
"My package went to the YVR airport depot due to incomplete address. When I went to pick it up, they could not find it. I waited an hour while they looked for it, but it was not found.

They said they would call me when it was found. But there was no call after 2 days, so I tried to call the depot. 8 calls over the next few days, and none were answered.

In the meantime, I contacted live chat, and they referred it to a tracing specialist. The specialist asked for package details, and I have not heard anything back for the last 2 days.

I cannot get the vendor to re-ship without a claim number, so I have now submitted a claim. But they told me they are 3 days behind in processing claims.

This was a birthday gift for my wife. It won't be resolved by then."

"Honestly.. i thought Purolator would of been the worst option and turned out to be best option after UPS had lost a next day air parcel. Sender had asked which company should he send replacement with..

Package arrived earlier than On Time and was scanned twice alerting via email that it was Out For Delivery.

5 stars for proper service."
"Had an attempted delivery of my package. I was left with no notice at my door and when I looked it up online, I had to call them to see where it was delivered. Called last night and waited for 10 minutes with no answer. Attempted the live chat, but nobody was available. Called back today, in the middle of the day, waited 15 minutes on hold and finally hung up. Tried calling a shipping location directly and it just kept ringing and ringing. I finally was able to chat with someone and they told me where it was. Awful customer service and I am very disappointed with the lack of help I could find."

My parents sent out a Christmas parcel on December 10th from Ontario and it was to be shipped to me in Grande prairie. The tracking showed that is was in Edmonton on December 14th which is only 4 hours away. Now the tracking shows it is back in Ontario with no further updates. The customer service representatives give no true answer of where the package is. You would think when someone pays over 100$ in shipping the package would be delivered properly. Now there is no way this will get here for Christmas. I already am away from my family for Christmas and now I won’t even have their gifts to open. All thanks purolator.

"Unfortunately, I have to add to the poor reviews. I re-arranged my day to be able to be home to receive a package that was to be delivered today. It did not come, and when I checked for an update, the website said it's back at the sort facility because ""Receiver unavailable - shipment scheduled for delivery next business day"" - yet no one has been by at all. I tried to contact the company, but despite it being their LiveChat business hours, my LiveChat request was cancelled ""because no agents are available"" and getting through on the phone seems impossible. Not pleased at all.

This is the definition of a joke of a company, never again will I use there service.

Quite possibly the worst delivery company I have ever experienced. Always promising to deliver goods by a certain time and never doing so. Failing to deliver to an address that every other company has no problems with. Delayed delivery. Poor website and a frustrating Live Chat option to talk through issues. Representatives refuse to acknowledge that I was deceived or lied to even though the evidence shows the contrary. I will NEVER use this company and will refuse to shop with any company that uses them - yes this includes Amazon!
"Purolator itself is great company, however the particular driver in my area, is not. His thr worst possible person to be delivering products and I'm not even sure why his employed. 3 years ago, I complained about him purposely delaying my shipments and missing my house. I have all the screen shots and tracking number of my goods, guess what? 3 years later, his still delaying my shipments. I really pray for this Christmas for him not to get fired but for Santa to give him a conscience to do his job, his paid to do. Please send me a message if your in the marpole area and you experience this sort of treatment. I'll be posting screenshots of this particular driver and how he routes my shipments. The latest excuses? Friday, can not deliver due to external factors. Monday, can not deliver due to external factors, I'm praying he doesnt deliver all week so I can update this post!"

"Just a terrible company, with horrible delivery service. I've never had an on time delivery from them, and sure enough the latest one (sent by Amazon) has been sitting for almost a week, less than a half hour away from my house, with no delivery attempts in that time.

I hope they go out of business and I make sure I complain to every company that ships with them because complaints to Purolator are a waste of time."

"According to the delivery detail, my package was out for delivery around 12:00pm from the place which 15mins drive away from my house. The estimated delivery time is 8:00pm and I waited until 9:00pm then I call them. It turns out they closed at 4pm. There must be something really wrong with the system.

The last time I used Purolator is about 1 year ago, and the experience is not that good either. After a year, the service has no improve at all, it seems to me that they guarantee a delayed delivery. If I can choose my courier when buying things from Amazon, I will definitely avoid picking Purolator."

"At the time writing this = Reviews 1,401 at 94% BAD and that's with the people who actually took the time to review it. Can you imagine the score if all of them did?

In the past, Purolator was an excellent choice for delivery but now?

Too bad you cannot rate 0 stars for this company. I understand that the drivers can be over-worked at times but when I called Purolator, the customer rep tells me that the driver will call beforehand for delivery of an over sized package and they don't?

Plus the stupid delays, got to love them for that. The package arrives at the main depot at 6AM (which is 15 min drive to my house) and then they decide the next day to load it on the truck to drive it all day without any attempts to deliver. Then they will deliver it the next day without the promised call beforehand. I had to take 2 days off for this! ~ Wish I could rate 0 stars ~

No wonder Canada Post owns this company, it truly shows!


*Edit* Sneaky... Sneaky... You can only post one review for all incidents! Well done, you sneaky bast*rds! Well done!

I have another review against them for just tossing by other package with no ringing the door bell, thank god neighbor noticed and called me to let me know. With the holidays approaching and little thieves loves boxes left for them on the steps of the door. Too lazy to place the package between the doors and ring the doorbell.

P.S. Just google ""purolator reviews"" and see the final truth of the bad experiences with them recently! Too bad, Purolator was once a good delivery company... hence the word ""Once""!

P.P.S. The usual ""copy and paste"" replies from ""Purolator Customer Care Team"" seems to be from Vanessa A. .Please send out a memo to the company via another company to guaranty delivery to resolve these issues once and for all. Because if you use Purolator for that memo delivery, it might not show up for them...."

"What a joke this company is, I have a disability and now I have to go and do their jobs!!
Dec 12/18 a door knocker was left on the front door of our condo building at 4:43 and I was at home. I don't believe the driver made any attempt to even deliver the parcel as we live on the 3rd floor, and yes we have an elevator.
Dec 13/18 today I watched the driver do up a door knocker get out of his truck and go an stick it on the glass of the front door. I am sure he did the same thing the day before also I can see the parking lots from our windows so I could see what he was doing.
Now with a disability I have to find a way to go downtown and pick up these parcels and try to maneuver them up to our 3rd floor condo
This is an absolutely discussing service for a company who is suppose to be in the Delivery Business. I will be notifying Amazon of Purolators Service"

"No 0 star option so this will have to do - This company is a joke. I've been waiting for a TV for 24 days that I ordered from bestbuy.ca. Have spoken to a Purolator phone agent 7 times for a total of 3 hours and 20 minutes. And spoken to their ""Live Chat"" agents 3 times as well, all with guarantees of getting my TV to me ASAP.

The TV was sent to my condo, but Purolator did not allow for it to be received by my concierge, despite having given them my explicit written consent to do so. Then it was sent to their holding facility over 40km away from where I live - I don't have a car, so requested to get it to a location closer to me.

The location they tried was closer, only 15km away this time... After trying to deliver the package to this 'Purolator Partner center"" on Sunday, (when it was closed - genius), it was routed back to the original location 40km away. They didn't even attempt to ship it back to the closer location. When i spoke to them after an hour on the phone, they agreed to ship it back to the closer location, and guaranteed it would be there by Thursday December 13.

Today when i received an email notification that said the package was delivered, I thought to myself, no way this company was stupid enough to have messed this up again... When i showed up to this Purolator partner pick up location today after work, my package was NOT there - turns out it was still in Etobicoke 40km away.

If anyone has read through this whole post, just know that Canada Post could go on strike for a year and still be a better and more reliable shipping service than Purolator. In fact, Carrier Pigeon would be more reliable at this point.

Save yourselves trouble, order on Amazon Prime, Canada Post, Fed Ex, or take a cab ride/drive/walk to a store and pick your package up, and force this joke of a company to start conducting themselves more professionally."

"Worst shipping company out there. They never knock on the door to deliver. They just slap a notice up so that I need to go across town to pick up my item. Why bother having drivers.

"The worst shipping company I've ever seen. They even steal your package and tell you that they left your package on the front door. So, they mean that if you didn't have your delivery, someone else stole it. This had happened to me when I ordered an item from Amazon and the shipping was Purolator.
I tracked my package from the tracking department and they emailed me that we did deliver it on your front door! Two days after, they emailed me with apologies on the delay and they said that your package is on the way in the truck and will deliver to you soon. When I arrived home, I saw an empty opened envelop on my side door!!! It never happened to me from Canada post and prime amazon and other companies. They are good burglars. I will never trust them and would never recommend this shipping company."
"Hi Shahad,

We're sorry to hear that you're shipment was stolen. If it was left unattended, the shipper must have selected the 'Signature not required' service.

"This delivery company takes no responsibility for missing packages. After contacting them to let them know that my package never came, they did nothing to help me, they just said that the driver scanned it as delivered. Four days after it was supposed to have been delivered to my home it did in fact turn up. It was hand delivered by an elderly and very kind man who drove across the city to bring the package that had been delivered to his address in error. The incompetence is unbelievable, how can a driver do his job if he cannot even read an address correctly?"

"ordered from two different websites, and both company used purolator since Canada post was on strike. Both times they lied saying they ""attempted delivery"" but we were home both days and nobody ever knocked on the door or called to say they are delivering my packages. Both times I went to purolator and thank God it's not too far from my house. But the line up to pick up my package was horrible, both times there were about 10 people or more waiting in line and it took both times about 25 to 35 minutes to get to the service counter. Also, I was asked the stupidest question ""Do you have the tracking number? it's hard to find your package in the back without that"" even though I had the delivery slip both times the people at the service counter also doesn't seem to know what they're doing. Why bother putting a delivery slip when the actual service counter person can't use it to find the package? Why can't the delivery person put the tracking number on the slip, if it's so important? I swear Purolator have serious issue, I don't believe this company is real, they're a joke, They are super disorganized as well, I feel sorry for the people working for this horrible company. Next time I order from a company and they use purolator to ship packages I'm just going to cancel my order. Not worth it! Avoid this company forever."

"I was on hold for what felt like 6.5 hours before I finally hung up and called their ""freight"" department and asked to be transfered to ""personal shipment"". MIRACULOUSLY, I was then onhold for only 2 minutes. After being PROMISED my computer would arrive on Monday, it was then delayed to Tuesday. It's now Tuesday night, and after making sure I was readily available to go outside my apartment (incase the driver doesn't know how to use an intercom) the package is ""rescheduled due to missed delivery"". Thanks for the last minute notice with no excuse. I would rather shove a fork into my eyes and twist than to trust purolator with my $1400 package again.

I was told three times it would arrive YESTERDAY, and apparently it takes 3+ business days to drive a computer from vancouver to vancouver. I don't know if everybody in this company is extremely incompetent, or they just don't give a f**** about people's time. If the package doesn't arrive by tomorrow morning when it's ""rescheduled"" to arrive by, then we're going to have some issues. Any normal company would call and notify about a change in dates, instead of updating their tracking info on their website hours after the company is closed.

My package from coming from Montreal to Ottawa (2 Hour drive). It got shipped on Nov 29th and I just received it yesterday on Dec 7th. It got rescheduled for delivery 4 times. It got transferred to another courier on Dec 6th and I was assured at that time by the Chat Agent that I would receive it on Dec 6th. Did not happen got it on Dec 7th. Could not reach Purolator on the phone. It 8 days for a small box to be delivered from Montreal to Ottawa. Totally unacceptable.

"Avoid lie the God damn plague

my mother sent me $300 worth of Christmas presents from BC to AB. took four days which is fine, but it still hasn't gotten to me. My mother said she received an email saying it was delivered, and if it was, it was stolen fro my front door. not attempt to contact me or her when it was ""delivered"" and there are 16 other people that live in this house that could have taken it, let alone the people that can see my front door from the street. i spent 45 minutes on hold, just to be told it was delivered and there is nothing that can be done. are you kidding me? nothing that can be done? no refund? no effort what so ever being put into seeing if it actually did get delivered or not? Then, i attempted for over an hour to get a hold of an online agent, who told me someone in a few days would contact me to tell me it was delivered, but nothing else wold be done. Absolutely outrageous. My mother is heartbroken and I am extremely angry. never use this company for anything."

"Would give a 0 if I could! This is absolute garbage service. I have called 3 times now being on hold and busy lines for 30 min+ Finally got a chance to talk with someone today. She was NO HELP saying all she can see is what I see. Which is the fact my package got delivered to ""my house"" but from ""Berry"" and ""Berry Signed it"" So I told her no berry lives here and I was home both days there was ""attempted deliveries"" and nobody came to my house once? SO where the hell is my package. $500 worth package I should say. This is actual crap service and I'm currently waiting to see if they can see where it is and see where it was delivered too. Like is this a joke to them cause I don't think its a joke at all. - and what happens if they cant find it... they say to contact the shipper :) just wow"

"Terrible service. Ordered a TV with 2 day shipping two weeks ago. Took purolator 5 business days to pick it up, tracking information shows the item out for delivery 2 days in a row without a return to facility scan in between. It has since stopped updating.

After many attempts to contact Purolator I was told by the tracing supervisor that the TV is ""probably"" with the other big items locked on 1 of 7 trailers full of items on delivery backlog. No ETA given regarding possible delivery date, nor was the supervisor able to even ensure that the item was definitely on site... I was also told that the trailers are not accessible and they cannot pull the item for me to pick up.

Very poor organization and salty, jaded customer service staff. Avoid like the plague."

"I made the mistake of shopping through a company that uses Purolator to deliver. I get a notification Monday (December 3) night from said company letting me know my package has been delivered.
Awesome, right?!
Delivered in a snowstorm, without my street being plowed, with no tire tracks, no visible signs anyone has been to my place at all!
It took me 2 days to track down where my package was (Edmonton North facility) and I have no been on hold for 25 minutes and counting trying to find out if this is actually true. As according to my tracking information, my order should be somewhere on my property since they magically delivered it on Monday.
I get it, the weather was atrocious on Monday. But to notify me it was delivered and forget to mention by delivered you actually meant still sitting in your facility where you don't actually plan on delivering it is infuriating.
That package is my daughter's dress for her Christmas concert, which is happening today. So thanks for that one. She is wearing a borrowed dress for her afternoon show as by the time I figured out where her dress was last night you guys were closed and since I can't actually get anyone on the phone to confirm my order is actually where I think it is (30 minutes on hold now) I can't trust that I'm going to show up there and have it be at a different facility.

Merry Christmas."

"From my experience they have been on time if not early but get really upset when they dont even ring the bell when they drop a parcel at my house! Theres been numerous times when I've been home and because they didn't ring the bell I didn't know the parcel was sitting right outside my door.
I know they are in a hurry but really not even ringing the bell?? Every other courier at least does that.
Due to all the thefts happening, youd think this would be a minimum standard."

"I had 1200$ of items shipped to me. Didn't realize it would be Purolator delivering. At first they couldn't deliver because they ""didn't have apartment entry code"", even though it was literally just the apartment number they had to punch in. Sent them an e-mail telling them the code, asking them to punch it in and alert us when they attempt next deliver.

The next day I check casually, note that the package says it was left in the main doorway, a LOBBY to a large apartment complex, a 112lb 1200$ parcel. I was not alerted it was delivered, so it was hours later that I checked my shipment tracking... Guess what wasn't in the lobby of my busy apartment building? My package.

Spoke to someone in live chat. Told me that ""Because it didn't require a signature that they could just deliver as long as it was on the property, and they aren't required to alert the tenant or individual that their package has arrived"".

So angry its unreal... And couldn't even yell at a regular person, because their phone lines make you wait over 45 minutes, resulting in requiring to use chat"
"Hello M. J.,

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback. We're sorry to hear you had a negative experience with us. Our drivers are not supposed to leave packages in a lobby, even if it does not require a signature. They can only leave them at the door of the apartment.

2nd time Purolator was suppose to drop a package off at my place and they didn't even attempt to see if I was home. They left a note on the door that they stopped by and no one was home but they didn't even knock. Both times I was home as well as my 70lb dog and we didn't hear them at all.
"I ordered a TV from Amazon two weeks ago. It was one-day shipping but Purolator never picked it. A week after the original order, Amazon realized it's not going to happen and created a replacement order.

This time the TV was picked up in Alberta and transported to Quebec. I check the status in the morning and it said ""On vehicle for delivery"". So I decided to stay at home to wait for it. Around 2pm, I checked the status again, and to my surprise, it became ""Shipment refused or could not be delivered"", although I had been waiting all the time.

I called their customer service. After about one hour's waiting on the line, I explained the situation to their agent, who was not very surprised. She even said it's probably because the driver did not have time to deliver every package so he just drove back to the facility. Apparently it's a common practice with them.

UPDATE: I talked to Purolator twice after the skipped delivery. Both times they promised it would be re-delivered the next day. And unsurprisingly, it did not happen. The third time when Amazon's representative called them, Purolator confirmed that it was already on its way back to Alberta. Amazon had to create a replacement, for a second time.

SOLUTION: It is possible to ask Amazon's representative to add a note to a particular address that a carrier should be avoided. Most representatives don't know this possibility. But it exists. I had to talk to several before such a note was added to my address."

Very slow lately and no updates on their tracking site.
"If any of you want to apply for a position at this PLACE, Think AGAIN!!!!!
I was EMAILED TO MEET UP WITH A MANAGER, NAMED LINA
FOR AN INTERVIEW.
WENT THERE EVERYONE LOOKED DUMB FOUNDED.
LINA HAS BEEN OFF ALL WEEK,
BUT SHE EMAILS ME TO COME FOR THIS DEAD END INTERVIEW.
SO THEY DUG SOMEONE OUT OF THE BACK,
PROBABLY THE JANITOR TO INTERVIEW ME.
VERY NON PROFESSIONAL DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW.
WAS TO BUSY TALKING CRAP.
SO BE WISE PEOPLE AND DO NOT APPLY THERE.
I HAVE BEEN TURNED DOWN 2 TIMES.AND NEVER APPLYING WITH THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN.
PREJUDICE BUSINESS."
"This company is 91% owned by Canada Post. Is that enough of an explanation? The true Canadian alternative, with real service, is UPS.

I sent a package to NJ from southern Ontario. The package tracking shows that it went to Buffalo, to Detroit, to Buffalo to Detroit, to Buffalo to Detroit ... yes THREE TIMES, and now it shows it's ""In Transit"" but nobody knows where it is, or what that means!!!

I could have walked it there faster.

The package was ""guaranteed"" to arrive Dec. 3rd. Today is Dec 5th and nobody knows where the package is or when it will arrive.

You will wait on the phone for 45 minutes for some rude person to tell you this. They suggest you use ""live chat"" to make it faster. Guess what? ""Live Chat"" is a no-show. Live Chat is about as fast as getting delivery from Purolator.

And get this -- their ""guaranteed"" delivery does NOT guarantee if you use their Ground Service.

Any one think this sounds oddly familiar? Like Canada Post familiar? Like the nightmare of your (postal service) dreams familiar?

Avoid this company like the plague!"
