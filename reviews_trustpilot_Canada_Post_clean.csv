Signed up for MyMail just now. I had to use a different e-mail address because the recovery process for my long-forgotten e-Post username and password crashed. Created new profile under a different e-mail only to discover MyMail is not available for my address. COMPLETE CANADA POST APP-TESTING FAIL!!!
"Sent an iPhone expresspost to Philippines from Ontario. Came back 14 days later with sticker ‚úÖ dangerous goods. I told the guy at the counter it was a used iPhone in original box, and he does not know it is classed as dangerous goods? If he does not know, how should I know? üôÑ"
"Canada post out of order and is a reflection of our Liberal government who don‚Äôt give a dam about its citizens. Don‚Äôt forget, we sign your pay cheque. Do better."
"What an absurd waste of money. Defund Canada Post. On 3 separate occasions with 3 separate employees I was quoted 1 price for an over sized letter (A small book). On the fourth occasion when I went to drop off the packaged and stamped books, the teller (who was one of the ones that gave me an incorrect quote a day earlier) told me it would be $1 more than what they had said. Now, it's only $1, but since I was planning to mail about 20-30 (I sell them) and since I had already quoted the shipping price I am now stuck eating the cost, around $1 per book for a total of $20-$30. On top of that the genius behind the counter asked me if I'd like a picture of the price scale to take home. I'm sorry but that's why I came to the store 4 times!!! What a waste of time and money."
"I paid extra for tracking and sent two birthday cards to my daughter in AB from ONT, both had gift cards in them. I purchased a Cda Post envelope and they were both sealed inside. These cards are extremely meaningful, because her father recently passed away. They were to arrive on May 23rd but have not yet arrived. If it has a tracking number, they should be able to locate it, right? No not yet and there is no one accountable! What was the point of paying more?
They need to change their system, perhaps investigate how Purolator, UPS and FED-EX meet their delivery dates. It's no wonder Cda Post reported a lost income of 292 million in 2022 to it's competitors. It's a sad day when you can't entrust your personal correspondance/parcels in the hands of our Canadian Postal Service. The federal gov't needs to investigate what is lacking in this service. I'm guessing not enough employees, outdated technology.
I had an MP tell me, sometimes things get lost but he is sorry for my issue? I'm sorry too because that's an UNACCEPTABLE answer. Obviously after reading all of these reviews, something is clearly wrong with this service."
"I sent a letter envelope with final papers to close a land deal a week ago from ontario to NB. Closing date is today,seven days later and my lawyer just called to say it didn't arrive. Looked up tracking number, and it's in mississauga still and if not there the deal may fall through. If it does, you can bet my lawyer will be in touch. Can get anyone on phone and chat is as useless as their delivery service. Time for Pierre to sell this corporation, like cbc, and use the buildings for housing."
"one of my parcel was coming all the way from India to canada. i had paid $120 to get it here in canada. I live on rent in basement and my landlord's guest attended the delivery man, he has denied to recognize as it was for tenants. but the delivery man did not even try to call me to confirm about the address issue or whatsoever they had thought. nor even any of canada post employee tried to contact me about the delivery failure , no text, no call to inform me that they planned to send back back my parcel to overseas(India) so quick just in 2 days gap. I used to track the parcel after every 2 days. and when i tracked that day- it showed me unsuccessful delivery. on that i called canada post that i will pick that up by own from the location as it was near. but they keep on denying that they will only send it back to sender. & excusing that might delivery man did not have your contact info. but whyyyyy? if i had given my contact details, that was for whatttt? if you could not have used that in this case. not even your employees have some duties to these basic office admin work at least as a one warning before sending it back to sender. i don't get this policy. if the receiver is here, parcel is here, recipient ready to pickup, why they were doing that. now i have to pay again for my parcel to get that. i told them that sender is not in next city, but in another country. that takes 16-17 hours to come. but of no use.
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Private corporations are Faaaaar better that this federal corporation . low standards."
"what the hell is wrong with this company... i literally ordered something so long ago and the delivery date keeps saying today, it doesnt change or anything. So wheres my package? Its been so long!"
"Never had a package delivered on time, aswell as having no updates until day of delivery it‚Äôs amazing too me that Canada post is still in business"
Canada Post needs to deliver its mailing services faster. I mailed some documents to my country in February 22nd 2023 and it was delivered on May 25th 2023
"Absolutely terrible experience, delayed very time-sensitive document of mine and was very bossy about it. Never choose this shipping service!!"
Multiple times I have to contact canada post to even pick up the item that was sent to their office electronically. On top of that makes excuses for not meeting delivery standards. Paid the money for 2 day shipping which takes them 6-8 buisness days. Unacceptable. USPS does a better job then these clowns
Sent a parcel to a mistake address which did not exist and was told address not known but parcel sent back to sender opened and emptied. How can a parcel be delivered to @n address that does not exist and still be returned to sender opened and emptied. An investigation being done as I have been told but seriously just smoke in the air becuz no one is held accountable and client not advised of WhT it happened.
Terrible experience with their Xpresspost service. There is no accurate information posted when looking up the tracking number of the parcel. All it says is ‚ÄúDelivered at invalid date.‚Äù I opened a ticket to speak to a manager but no one‚Äôs called me back. Horrible service; wasted money.
Worst service ever you can imagine. Never trust them
"Had the privilege to meet a very helpful & professional mail lady, Leah Holmberg, who went above and beyond to help me out on May 29th, 2023 at a parcel pickup only Forbes Pharmacy in Langford, Victoria BC. There was a parcel delivered to this pharmacy for my daughter who runs a fishing lodge in Zebollus BC. The company she ordered from in Vancouver made a mistake instead of sending it to Zebollus they sent it to her home address. She is already up at Zebollus and needed the parcel there ASAP. The mail lady told me what needed to be done‚Ä¶ I had to take the parcel to post office that mailed packages as the one it came to the lady do not work for the Post Office. So the closest one was not far away so she offered to take the box on her dolly and bring it over to the post office and she will wait for me to pay for it and she took the parcel again and put it on her dolly to take the postal depot so my daughter could get it quickly. She went above and beyond her job description. Leah, thank you so much for your help and understanding. The world needs more workers like you. It was greatly appreciated by my daughter and myself. I hope her manager reads this and acknowledges her for the awesome job she is doing. Thanks again Leah.

"I hope you find my parcel. You've sent me a text saying that my parcel had been delivered where it was not. Funny because i had two parcels, one was delivered successfully but the other one got lost somewhere ü§î"
This has been the 2nd time I‚Äôve sent money to my grandmother inside a card and someone has ripped it open and stolen it. She received her card in a plastic bag with a ripped up envelope. Maybe upping surveillance would stop this. For now I‚Äôll stick to other shipping companies.
NOT SURE WHY THEY CHARGE PEOPLE FOR EXPRESS DELIVERY AND THEN JUST CHANGE THE DELIVERY TIME AND LET YOUR PACKAGE SIT AT THE DEPOT FOR 4 MORE DAYS . TYPICALL WE DONT CARE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AS LONG AS THEY HAVEPAYED FOR OUR CRAPPY SERVICE .
They delayed my packaged by 3 weeks only because my postal code doesn't match with the ones in their system. The package is here in my location and I can't even go and pick it up. I can't do anything other than wait for them to figure out there is no other place in Victoria with the same Street address as the one I provided.
"Fake deliveries, they make you listen to ads while on hold if you try to contact customer service, the automated voice doesn't understand anything, the only way to talk to a human being is screaming, probably the worst customer service in the world."
"Terrible service, Xpresdpost Late 4 Days+ never trust these people, cost me $1000 for my flight delay."
Waiting on a package to be delivered that is now two weeks late. Now given up on it arriving at all. Might as well throw your money in the garbage when using this service. Will never use Canada Post again.
order a package Coming from the city I live in And they keep delaying the time it will arrive with no updates. Order another package the someday coming form across the province form another company with Standard shipping It got here 2 days age.
Hi my name is Linda. I live at Dovertree Pl SE. As I have been told we have a new deliverer. We used to get our mail by 1pm. I'm still waiting and it's 3:30pm. I have been told and witnessed it myself. This person can't even sort the mail properly. Lots of us are getting other ppls mail. I think they need better training. Living in Calgary Alberta.
The service is getting worse and worse all the time. They don't update the tracking. They don't help you when you call. And they send your package around the country...or they just let it sit in a warehouse somewhere. You pay to be ignored nowadays... üëé
"LAZY WORKERS!!!
They rarely deliver my product to my house.
They rather make 1 stop and drop everything off at the office and when it's dropped off, you have to wait 5 hours before receiving the product."
"Realy I had to put a start becouse is the minimum bat this company is the worst.
I send a package a leeter to the exterior international way.
After 16 days not received yet, they dont now where is the letter, the tracking number dosent work.
Really is a poor company.
I never more going to use services from them.

(POOR,POOR Company and services)."
"Absolute Joke Canada Post is , There service sucks ! Cant get ANYTHING right. Shocking service ! There mail men/woman are useless! They cant be bothered to walk upstairs and deliver to my business!

I see why they have such terrible reviews! EVERYONE says the same thing! ""JOKE"""
A joke and a half. I ordered something and it went through Canada post. First mistake. It got delivered to a city 1hr away at someone else‚Äôs doorstep when my address is very much correct. They‚Äôve opened an investigation and we will see if they ‚Äúfind‚Äù it. At that point I have to contact the sender to reissue and claim a lost item. So sick of Canada post and their idiotic people.
"My parcel was sent to Montreal Quebec from BC it was meant to stay in BC. (An 8 hour trip by car from Langley to Nelson. ) Postal code for BC starts with V.
Montreal starts with H. Needless to say my sister did not receive her much needed goods. Parcel value of at least $200 they only cover $100. Which I just found out. Parcel outlet in Langley said out of their hands after it leaves there. Then it goes to Richmond. Flat rate box was close to $22. Phoned Canada Post it‚Äôs under investigation tracked this morning and has finally been sent back to BC. Today finally out for delivery in Nelson. Ok so don‚Äôt know if employees in Richmond are actually reading the addresses or postal codes. Very upsetting to say the least and now can no longer trust Canada Post."
"Canada post is the worst i have 2 separate set of mail on being my husbands drivers license that was renewed july of 2022 he just received it after contacting the MP and having them reached out he still have not received his health card, going 2 years. Now we have not received his travel documents which is register mail , my husband has to have critical surgery and can not travel, if his condition gets worst Canada post will be liable, they blame it on covid , all they are doing is creating a backlog to advocate for more money to line their pockets,i get it high interest rate, Canada post is a disgrace to canadians and the Government of Canada. There is allot of people facing this issue with Canada post. They steal packages and its not just the lower level employees also managers. The Government should end Canada post and its corrupt lazy employees. Canadian's deserve better, with such a large GDP and operating worst than a third world country. I hope someone from the Trudeau Government see this and take action. Most of these people that are making Canadians lives difficult their names have never been on a ballet. Canada post is like dirty stain on a white shirt at this point. I'm very sure Doug Ettinger is getting his mail and packages. In all my years of living here I never thought Canada would be like this. Canada post don't care about regular Canadians. Now if my husband becomes a paraplegic or Brain damage it will be on Doug Ettniger and Canada Post hands, We are a family of 5 just my husband and I our youngest is 5 years old. STOP PLAY WITH CANADAINS LIVES .."
Too many people impersonate a Canada Post employee and they send you messages on messages hoping that they can scam you that you will click on their link so that they can steal your banking info.
"Was expecting a shipment and received tracking info.
Tracking advised ""Delivery tonight"" on May 2.

Then ""Delivery delayed"" for 6 days
Then ""Package has cleared customs"" 7 days later
Then ""Delivery tonight"" for 3 days

Hence, the entire tracking portal is obvious not up to date. So why even offer it?"
They said I had a package delivered to my community mail box they left no key called them today and they said they would leave a key they did but my parcel is not there once again so it must have been delivered to the wrong address an no one seems to want to help local post office won't even answer the phone frustrating beyond beliefs
"Quick n efficient service ,I sent few physical document s from Sarnia Christina road ,Canada post to Ottawa Ndeb on 28 April n it was delivered n received on May 1 ,..so fast service .. thank you"
"Canada post does not deserve one star. They entered my home without permission. No one ever called and apologized. It wasn‚Äôt till the RCMP called me and told me that they would not be delivering to my house anymore that they would just be delivering to another route. How is this possible, how do they justify keeping this person on staff when they know it‚Äôs illegal to enter someone‚Äôs home without their permission. I am so disgusted with Canada post. This is why I don‚Äôt use her services I know people mail things to me unfortunately. I recommend FedEx or another company if all possible. You cannot trust Canada Post as they will enter your house at any given time without your permission. Do not trust Canada Post !!!"
I never received my parcel that was suppose to have been delivered to my community mailbox. I went down to the office of my cities branch and filled out a document 4 weeks ago and I have not heard a thing since. Very poor costumer service.
"My mail has been missing for a month. Canada post gave me the runaround and suspended their ""investigation"" after 3 days when orginally supposed to be a week investigating. My regular post man has been off for a month and theres a replacement when all of a sudden my mail is missing...hmmm. what a bunch of crooks"
"Impossible to have someone on the phone, they won‚Äôt follow delivery Instructions, if they ¬´ can‚Äôt access the building ¬ª they won‚Äôt call you or even ring the intercom for you to open them the door, then will say it‚Äôs the wrong address, even when you create a ticket via there chat they still won‚Äôt follow the delivery instructions, completely useless."
"Canada post is the worst shipping company on this planet... Extremely long shipping times, terrible drivers, terrible customer service, terrible everything... pay the extra to avoid them."
"They lost a package. The company I ordered from called and found out whoever picked it up didn't scan it before they went back to the Station and guess what, when that happens you cannot open an Investigation. Seems like they figured out you can take packages and don't have to be accountable. Worst delivery system."
"1. Their chat system automatically disconnects immediately after your phone goes to sleep that‚Äôs terrible or you minimize within a sec

2. Their delivery is not fast"
I can't receive any help with an online order I made through them. It keeps sending me in loops when I use the phone service. The design is extremely poor.
"Zero star for me as well. I've had nothing but bad experiences with Canada Post every time an online store uses them to ship the products I attempt to purchase. Recently, I purchased a small item from a Toronto online retailer to be delivered to my home in Montreal. The shipment was supposed to be ""express delivery"". Their tracking initially indicated a delivery date. When delivery did not occur on that day, then the next day, their tracking page indicated ""Item delayed. Stay tuned for update"". Their tracking page showed this notice for over a week. All in all, it took more than 2 weeks to finally get my package. I would have been better off walking to the store in Toronto and walking back to Montreal thereafter. In addition to many experiences like this, I noticed that every time an online store requires a signature before delivery, the mail delivery person in my building never bothers to ring me for my signature. They simply glue a notice on the front door instructing me to go pick up my parcel at some address around my neighborhood on the next day. Poor service, no effort to accommodate customers. It's all about making sure their job is easy peasy... Awful people, really...."
0 star. No confirmation of delivery. No signature...nothing. Absolutely horrendous service. Package says delivered but it is not! $300 of package. Well done Canada POST
"They routed a parcel to be delivered to me to the wrong location. Six days later, no tracking update, just says it's be re-routed, expect delay. Contacted customer service and spoke to someone who barely spoke English so I couldn't understand much. I buy CDs and albums online, and am often told Canada is a nightmare to ship to. We also don't track many foreign tracking numbers anymore it seems. Just a deplorable service we have to tolerate in Canada."
"Anyone shipping with Canada Post will lose customers. I will never buy a product from anyone that ships with Canada Post. 4 out of 5 shipments were not delivered ""Unable To Deliver"" If a product I order is shipped through Canada Post IT WILL BE RETURNED. they do NOT fulfill their delivery contract, and will not resolve issues. If I could give a minus I would"
"I was expecting a package on April 27th and it said delivered but I had no package I checked several days later nothing so I open an investigation and I gave them 5 days to find my package nothing so I call them and they had a note on my file saying ""package could not be tracked investigation closed"" USELESS!!! WORST COMPANY EVER! Didn't even get an email or anything to say they aren't doing shi* about my package! Not only did they not refund me they didn't even have an answer to why they didn't investigate the situation properly. I spent over $130 only for you to deliver it to someone else!? How hard is it to read an address??? I've never had an issue with my packages being delivered until they hired a new mailman for my route. DO BETTER CANADA POST!"
The Canada post delivery guy do a terrible job and always lie
"The package was picked up by CP on Monday Apr 24, 2023 for shipping and then nothing was done until Thursday when I called. In the interim, the CP application told me I would get the package on Tuesday and then Thursday. I was later told this was a glitch in their software. After the call, I was told it would arrive on Friday. It arrived in town that morning but then was mistakenly sent to the wrong location. I was notified there would be a delay but they would still try to deliver it that day. It is now Monday May 1, 2023 and there is no delivery time. Issues - 1 - No sense of urgency. 2 - If there is a problem, their procedures are to take up to 2 days to look into it. 3 - If it is then not fixed, CP does an investigation which can take 2-3 weeks. At a time when an order can be placed with Amazon at midnight and the package delivered by noon the next day, Canada Post is competing using a Model T and their competition are using Tesla's. This is a management problem at CP. The bar is set so low, they can always attain it. Their internal metrics must look great. Until management decides to start competing, nothing will change. The CP agents I spoke to all seemed to be doing their jobs correctly according to the CP procedures."
If I could give them less I would. Expected delivery of package 24/3 it‚Äôs now 1/5 and still not arrived. Website useless chat does not work and it does not recognise uk postcode. Each time I track it just changes todays date. Frustrating and waste of my time and money.
"I've been a casual for two year and on average get one shift per month. Since union dues are $91 per month my take home pay us about $20.

Worst decision I ever made was to accept ""the great opportunity "" at canada post."
"I was expecting a package on Friday and was left a notice to pick it up at the post office. I went today because it's the only day I can get it and was told it won't be available until 7 pm on Monday. I tried to reach out through live chat to get help with this, their chat system doesn't work. I called and that was a nightmare just to get someone to talk to. When I finally did get someone, they made it a big deal that I was trying to get my package and didn't understand why I couldn't go another day to get it. I work 12-hour shifts, how am I supposed to Canada Post?"
"Canada post is far the worst logistic company, i don‚Äôt know why they exist, merchandise from China come to Toronto in 2-3 days, from Toronto to Hamilton 7-8 days with Canada Post."
"Unreliable and very careless with packages, in fact I'm pretty sure there are thieves there this is the second time in 2 years I haven't received a package yet its been delivered then you get the run around and excuse for it...bottem line thieves!!"
I drove 30 miles to pick up a package that I paid to have delivered to an address . My mistake was I had the package delivered to my wife‚Äôs office to save delivery time. My identification address did not match my wife‚Äôs office address. The post office employee hit the brick wall and had no practical solution to resolve the matter. The package contained about $4000 parts that I needed TODAY. When I became frustrated with their lack of answers she began screeming at me to get out and not come back. So now how do I get my parts? I drove half an hour to another post office and told the lady there the entire situation. She immediately pulled out a form from under the counter and showed me how to fill it in. My wife returned with the proper paperwork which I should have been given in the first place and she retrieved my parts. I would like Canada post to reimburse me for fuel and four hours of my time. But being a government service we all know that will never happen. NEVER again will I rely on Canada post for parcel delivery. Most post office employees are very good but this one certainly was not. Most government services don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt know what real customer service is. They need to work in the real world where there are real repercussions for their actions. I will be insisting on other courier services in the future.
"My package was lost in delivery, the tracking system said that it was delivered to my local post office. However, I went to the post office and the ladies there told me the item was not at the post office and not available in the tracking system. Weird. I then went online to speak to a costumer service representative and was only given an AI over the phone that was extremely not user friendly and could not help. I then was directed to the online chat services where the agent did not answer my questions and told me I was wrong about my package, then disconnected the chat from me. Extremely unprofessional and unreliable."
There isn't 0 stars so have to use 1 star. When your only business is to deliver on time only Can Post could be so bad at what they do. Any other business would long be closed. I can't think of a time a delivery date was met.
"Terrible system, unusually long wait times. Was suppose to receive my package today for it to be pushed back another week."
"Would give zero stars if possible. I paid over $27 and sent an Expresspost on April 6 from Peterborough to Sudbury to the government for my late dad's estate to make sure it was in before any labour disruption. I even paid $2 for signature required. It still shows as not delivered and got excuse after excuse. They said it arrived in Sudbury April 13 (I could have walked there faster and delivered it) but kept saying ""it missed the cut off"". Yes, the cut off at Easter! They kept pushing out the delivery date and saying 'out for delivery'...but no delivery proof!! I had to escalate my complaint to the President's office. It is now April 24th, permanently shows out for delivery on the website. Nobody there seems willing or able to be accountable, or even call the depot to ask. They claim to not use agents for deliveries but this is a lie, they completely use subcontractors. Never use Canada Post. Use a courier company like FedEx. The chat feature on the website is useless. The call center agents are also equally unhelpful. Don't give them anything that requires proof of delivery. These guys are lazy as hell. Complete failure. They are charging a large fee for a premium service, but do not support it. If I did that to my clients, they would be asking questions too. The $2 signature required fee is not backed up by then actually getting a signature. They said they they don't do that when delivering to the government. Unbelievably poor service for a premium product. Do not use them for anything except mail that is not urgent. They need to fire people there."
how f√º√ák slow do you have to be to scan a box find out it has and ship it out already the due date was the 19 of this month and now were going in to the next month and still no updates when u should be posting update to keep us informed. and not leave us hanging wondering when going on whats taking so long. get off your asses do your job and get stuff out faster
"Worst delivery service. Only lazy people work here. Whenever order something online and if getting delovered through canada post they just post sticker and I need to pick. What is the point of ordering online if everytime I am going to walk and pick the delivery?
Btw I am always at home and still they say delivery was missed.
Hate this service"
Claim package was delivered. Was not. They simply say driver says it was deliverd and scanned. For we all know driver scanned then kept package. Such an easy out for them. Now I'm out a $140.00 solely because I trusted Canada Post. Zero accounabilty on there part.
"Anything above 0 stars is being more than generous. Apparently, we aren't allowed to pay duties and taxes online anymore (or at least for the time being, which is still inconvenient either way). What the heck are these dun bells getting paid for?

They don't want to deliver our packages, they leave a delivery notice card making us come down to the post office on our own time when we used to be able to pay taxes online and have packages conveniently delivered to our PO box, but now it seems like they want to take things one step further to tick us off, right?

I wonder if any hire ups ever check online reviews to see how many one stars they have? But I bet their heads are so far up their asses they don't even bother. I've already written in to complain, but I doubt they'll check that message, either.

There is only one thing Canada Post is capable of doing right: Wasting everyone's time. Every other postal service IN THE WORLD allows you to pay duties and taxes online except our ever favoured Canada Post.

You'd think in 2023 they'd finally understand how technology works and that people like to do nearly everything online. I don't know a single person who enjoys driving down to the post office after work or on their time off."
"I sent my Grandsons Card out on the 11th of April priority post for 14.00 dollars it should have arrived on the 14th but it some how is stuck in a loop between Hamilton and Toronto it is now bin 6 days and is still stuck, card, and money for grandson gone ! Their excuse was the labeling ""lame"" . I was going too send my tax info to my accountant through them but I wish never to deal with them again So it looks like the money and the card will never arrive and I feel they stole it at this point in time . NEVER AGAIN !"
"Why are all my BUSINESS packages being stuck for days at the Ottawa processing Center??!!! Why?!!!!! I‚Äôm talking 3 - 5 business days sitting in their trucks before they even get processed there to get shipped out to surrounding areas!! This absolutely ridiculous and they lie and don‚Äôt care! Government company, so no surprise. Im really thinking about filing a lawsuit, I‚Äôm losing money due to their incompetence."
"Check your receipt the next time you send anything Canada Post (if you're still na√Øve enough to do that, that is). There is now a $5 ""fuel surcharge"" on top of their delivery charges. If you're using their site to estimate shipping charges, they neglect to include this fee in their estimate. If you add it, and then compare their charges with those of UPS or Fedex, you'll probably find that while the latter are going to be a couple of dollars more, when you factor in that your recipient will actually get a package - on time - and not just a ""delivery notice"", they're actually a better deal. A much better deal, in fact.

Canada Post used to be able to get away with murder because they were considerably cheaper than the alternatives. Now they charge just as much, only they're days or weeks slower, and don't actually deliver your parcels.

Their ""Xpresspost"" service - which they pretend is guaranteed - is neither guaranteed nor express. All you're doing is essentially paying a premium price for regular service - and where Canada Post is concerned, regular service is really, really bad. Just try making a claim when their 1 day guaranteed delivery takes 5 days or longer. Everything, and I mean everything, is excluded from that guarantee.

Be smarter and don't use them. If the company you're shopping with uses them, buy from someone else who uses a better shipper. And literally every other shipper is better."
"Useless counterintuitive company.
Why ask for my phone number if you refuse to contact me if there is an issue with delivery? They delivered it to the wrong address, 3 buildings down the street. instead of calling the number on the packing slip the policy is to immediately return the package to sender when something goes wrong with delivery. Wasting everyone time and money. They could have easily called me and i would have even gone and picked it up. But that is way too much effort for them and they wouldn't get another $20 shipping fee for the extra 3 trips across the country this package now has to make.

Greedy, lazy, counter intuitive and useless."
"Second package now where there has been no attempt at delivery, I have been waiting by the door, hear the mailbox close with no knock or ring of the doorbell at all to find a delivery notice in the mailbox."
"I wanted to give 0 star if possible. I got a shipment from Richmont Hill to Hamilton and it took 1 month late. When I contacted the agent, they said they have no idea on my shipment and asked me to contact the sender in order that the sender contact them again to check the shipment. It doesn't make sense at all. After that she seemed like close my chat window impolitely."
"It‚Äôs a good thing I have honest neighbours because our local mailwoman isn‚Äôt all that fussed about delivering to the address on the label. I prefer to pay the extra to private courier companies that risk paying for an item that my neighbour will get.

PS I dated it today but the problem has been going on for years."
"Overall horrible experiences with the last 3 packages that have been shipped through Canada Post. The first package was a day late but the tracking didn't update to say delivered for two additional days. Same issue with the second package and in addition was delivered to the incorrect address. Third package I still have not received and the delivery date keeps being pushed each day. These were all Canada to Canada packages. When I contact Canada Post customer service, they are not helpful at all. They never have any information or options to help."
"I would like to thanks Ellaine of James Mowatt Trail Southwest Edmonton Ab area who delivered on time our parcel..she is one of a kind delivery woman.even if the parcel is heavy she was not lazy to delivered. she called me every time,if i have a boxes.Im doing my business since 2020. And Ellaine is the one who helped us to become successful because of her perseverance of her work.She is the best employee in the Canada post.Hands up to Ellaine.and thanks to Ellaine.

Start 2022-2023"
"Hi May name is Wilson ! I would like to say thank you for wonderful service, from location canada post at James Mowatt trail sw Edmonton alberta, the guys his name Karan hes always helping me and very professional to guide me.

Thank you

Have a great day"
"Never and I mean never use Canada post, by far the worst carrier in the whole world! This company takes so long despite having so much Post offices in Canada. My order what was supposed to come at march 29-april 3 it was overdue and still don‚Äôt have it! Its April 17 where is my package why has it been in Missisauga for so long!!! Also they deliver at the worst times ever! Last week was nice and sunny all week but now its raining and now they decide to deliver!? Are you crazy!"
Canada post is the worst canadian company overalll. Fcuku canada post for wasting so much time . Everytime i have a parcel they lie about trying to attempt a delivery and update on there site when they actually never attempt. This guys wont even knock your door to gave you the parcel instead these lazy ass people just leave a paper on your door so now you have to wait one more day for your parcel shame on this shtty company f*k u.
Why the hell is it taking so long to deliver my monthly package? Is late 3 weeks. What is wrong with you people? Why do you get away with this?????
"A correctly labeled address, correctly shipped yet incorrectly delivered in the wrong Mailbox, waiting for a sticker and checking my local post office, talking to my building manager, hunting for this misdelivered package, yet, after 3 days I'm told I can no longer call to re-send and require the sender to? Why is this process so stupidly difficult and tedious. They put my mail in the wrong spot when I call to re-deliver they deny me? Last year my taxes came in late August dated for June then I was charged a late fee, yet I'd have paid on time had the government's Mail Delivery system not been an absolutely terrible joke of an experience that we, as Canadians have no choice but to use. Canada Post does nothing to help ease my frustrations or financial position. They make mistakes and instead of fixing it by simply resending the package to where it was labeled to be delivered it becomes my headache and yet I'm still stuck working with the people who can't get it right in the first place. Its a mind boggling wonder how they have a 1 star review across the board with such rediculously enforced regulations and incompetence. I don't blame someone for making a mistake but I blame the company who won't resend to the address labeled on the shipped package within 3 days when it takes them weeks-months to deliver, and even longer still to deliver it to the address, labeled on the box."
"Canada post are beginning to extort customers with a priority bill that never ships your goods as priority.
Its annoying how a government owned courier service have this unhealthy, insincere customer service"
"Internet stores/shippers: find another agent to handle your customer‚Äôs packages. You are charging us (customers) a premium for ‚ÄúExpedited‚Äù or ‚ÄúPriority‚Äù Post. And it‚Äôs not happening! Two day shipping has turned into four or five. Useless and expensive.
Please, base your decision on customer satisfaction and provide options other than Canada Post!"
"This has got to be the worst company ever, do not send anything through them, use FedEx. Paid for priority and it didn't even leave Ontario until 2 days later!!! STAY AWAY!"
"Terrible service as always at Dieppe Irving location. Told to go elsewhere to send parcel, as they were too busy!"
"i had the worst experience with them than any other compagny, custmer serivice are trash they dont help.my item was shipped express by my brother to recive it next day. is been 2 month they lost it. never delivere they dont help me and dont tell me where is it and is taking soo long. yall better deal with any other compagmy but not post canada is stright garbage"
"Talk about misinformation!!! Online they texted that the letter was delivered Monday and they provided ""proof of delivery"" with no signature. Tuesday they said there was a problem with the address. Wednesday they said it was to be delivered Thursday. And still no letter yet. Glad I paid $23 dollars."
my item keeps getting delayed been waiting for almost 10 days
"You can't even raise a concern to customer service. If you manage to get through, obstacle one, on an awfully designed phone and online system they may just hang up on you or disconnect, if you do they simply may not enter ticket and give you a fictional number. When you call to follow up or ask for follow up call, nothing, often file never entered. They habitually lose packages. Deliver incorrect addresses. Do not maintain community boxes. On and on. I'd complain but apparently nobody even listening there. Multiple instances over many years, nothing improves, far from it."
"I was charged $20 to mail a small book half way across BC. 3 months ago it cost me $28 to ship heavy work boots to the same address, I accepted the cost because of what I was sending. Unfortunately where I live we don't have many options. Canada Post has to go!"
Paid for 3 day express shipping and took almost 2 weeks to get there. Tracking said there was a processing error which cause a delay then bad weather. I submitted a request for delay refund and was turned down due to causes beyond there control. How is a processing error delay considered beyond there control. This company would be out of business if it were a private company. They need to get their act together.
"canada post gotta be the worst delivery service you choose for any package you buy online, canada post is only good for mails but very awful with items."
"Awful company!

They broke a very important piece of what I was sending through them and their customer service is ass! Choose another company to send through because they do not give one care about righting their wrongs OR providing any at all customer service when they mess up!
Their website does not link to live chat or anything even when you click the link, nor does their service line actively give any service at all!
Their CEO and the board of directors needs to be offed."
I ordered something quite pricey and it was supposed to arrive on the 10th and the sender info was unavailable. I called yesterday around 4 and asked if they had my package and I was willing to go pick it up and the lady told me ‚Äúit isnt the end of day‚Äù in such a rude tone. Today I saw the truck so I ran downstairs and I told her to wait one minute because my friend was going to throw my ID down the balcony but the driver literally left and said that I wasnt home when she gave the notice today. Honeatly what kind of a service is this service??
"Canada post sucks üíØ best in the country?
Horrible! always late !"
"garbage, close this company"
Sender unavailable. Delivery date unavailable. That's great tracking info. The worst is that CP reps are trained to lie to you. CP emoyees have told me this personally. The recording says they only see what we see. Lie. Front line staff see more than you. Supervisors see more than them and managers see even more. Its lies and hidden problems all the way it the chain. They are absolutely aware of every gripe stated in this endless list of 1 star reviews but simply don't care. None of our reviews make any difference as they believe its normal for a flagship mail service to be terrible. Yes that's right. It's normal according to CP emoyees.
Absolutely garbage service never again couldn't sent the package to the designated location then 4 months later it shows up smashed and in pieces!
"Don't have anything delivered using Canada Post regardless of where in Canada you live, in the middle of a city or out in rural areas, they are always ridiculously slow and unprofessional"
"I have a small padded envelope that weighs 30 grams and I am not sure why the cost is $21 to ship from Ontario to BC‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs way too expensive. Canada post gets tons of packages so it shouldn‚Äôt be this much, it‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôll take my business else where."
"Horrid service.
Amazon can ship, for free, from anywhere in North America in 3 days.
Canadapost takes 3 weeks to ship across Canada at a premium price.
No excuses for that"
"What went wrong again? I ordered a bath transfer chair for my blind 90yo mum. It's free shipping from Wellwise here in Brampton. I signed up for an account so that I can receive notifications and texts on my cell. The option of where to deliver was checked as FRONT Door; this being the front door of lobby in my mum's assisted living apt bldg. When text says arrival imminent, I would text back to CanPost to ring on number for PSW's to come and receive the box. Instead the CanPost turkey leaves a remote site pickup note and disappears with the box. Disgusting lazy inconsiderate cruel employees and policies. As her son with no car, how IH do I pickup now?"
THE MOST USELESS PEOPLE EVER THEY MUST ALL BE LIBERALS
"The worst company I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of delivering a package to me. Delayed every step of the way.
Out for delivery 3 days in a row but never actually dropped off.
I‚Äôm so upset. The WORST company. if you use this company to deliver your product I won‚Äôt be buying it."
"Priority package mailing and 3 days delay from delivery date. Until now I have no Idea where my package is. Called their customer service and all they can say is wait. I've been waiting for 3 days now. It's supposed to arrive 3 days ago and it still says ""In transit"" WOW"
"Canada Post literally does not know how to do their job. I paid for signature required - Canada Post delivered to wrong address, accepted a wrong name and signature, then wouldn't tell me where they did this. I was not able to recover my parcel. Investigation took almost 2 months just to call me back, and their conclusion was that now too much time had passed to be able to do anything about it. Incompetence at its finest! Investigator and Ombudsman were just as bad as the delivery driver. Save yourself the agony and avoid Canada Post at all cost - or it will cost you."
"I find it odd that a envelope was processed in Whitehorse, YT and it take 7 business days to get to a major city (Edmonton). They must be using dogsleds up there for mail delivery as the envelope was processed in Whitehorse on April 3 and today still says it is in transit and won't be delivered until April 13th. Canada Post says the weather and modes of transportation cause the delays. I guess truck and airplanes are unavailable in the Territories. It is disappointing that they resort to Dog Sleds to deliver mail."
I find it confusing why a government company can set a national guarantee for expresspost in all their advertising and forget to inform that it does not apply to the territories. Like they are not part of Canada. The advertising should mention territories are excluded from the guarantee.
This shipping service is always disappointing.And it‚Äôs like the keep on getting worse and worse.
"I always worry when companies I order from ship via Canada Post. 9 times out of 10, the delivery is delayed, gets lost or ends up being sent back. If I could choose the carrier, I would opt for FedEx or UPS as there are seldom any issues. Again today, item out for delivery from postal office in my neighbourhood; however, at time of expected delivery, received a notice indicating ""Item re-routed due to processing error; Possible delay"" in ANOTHER CITY! It's now the rule rather than the exception."
Sent a registered mail to UK from Toronto. It took over 5 weeks for the mail to be processed in Montreal Quebec before it made its to the UK.
If I could give them 0 or negative star I'd love to. My package is ripped open again. Nothing but an empty parcel was delivered.
"I paid for expedited service with signature required. It should have arrived at my door but the mail person just drove right by and left delivery notices. I called the local office which should have been able to do something, it's a small town of 10,000 and takes a whole 5 minutes to drive across but they refused to do a thing and told me to contact customer service. I did and fought with their useless phone answering AI for 10 minutes as it kept screwing up and finally yelled at it ""OPERATOR"" before it would put me through. Customer service starting a look into it but that doesn't really help me, I still can't get the stupid thing until tomorrow afternoon. Canada Post only offers service and have done this more than once, they suck at providing any decent level of service and I wasted $30 bucks."
The worst shipping service I've ever experienced.
"Shipped international to Asia. Package was sent Dec 5th 2022, until now April 3rd, 2023 no package arrived at all. Maybe it's already lost no one contacted me for any deliveries or updates. Shipping fee is always expensive too. If only I can put zero stars."
"Canada Post claimed my item had been delivered. On the day in question that they said it was delivered, I was at home the entire day, and my living room is next to my front door, so I was present for anyone approaching my front door. No delivery was made all day. My subsequent experience with their customer service has been abhorrent, with no help being offered at all. Instead they simply ask ""Did you check around? Did you ask the other people in your household?"" No positive action was taken whatsoever. Cost me $175."
"Tracking said package will be delivered Friday, wait in all day, then at 9.30pm, they update it to delivery Tuesday. The Brick can provide you with a two hour window; Uline 4hrs, but Canada Post can only provide a 24 hr window, and then they fail to deliver. Absolutely useless. Canada Post have one job, and they can't do that."
What went wrong this time .. really? I am being told a week for Xpresspost delivery 2-3 days at the most I was lead to believe. Now even after red flagging this package my parcel is literally an hour away from me as of 10 20 am it is 4 21 pm and I'm now being told next Monday ... not friggin impressed.
"A tracked package shown as delivered was not delivered to me.

I'm unable to file a ticket tonight as that part (and also the ""contact"", but not other, links near the bottom) of their website is not currently working. I am unable to speak to an ombudsman without a dispute number.

Previously, I received a key that, after some troubleshooting, opened a different parcel box than the parcel box number listed on the key.

Edit: Package eventually arrived (3 weeks late)."
"Package was delivered a Day early and 2 Days early on my last shipment.
Tracking is done well and the text
Once it arrived was Fantastic!"
"The worst post service ever existed, and possibly one of the worst companies in the world. They either 1) lose your package or 2) send it back. They simply cannot deliver anything."
"My package was shipped out on March-14th as Expedited from Mississauga (GTA) to Montreal & Today is March-27th & yet it's still in Transit,
I understand the ""Snail mail concept"" but even Snail mail shouldn't take that long to come from one Major city to another...
it's not even the Holiday season anymore for God sake.."
"HI, I truly can not believe that Canada Post would make a senior citizen have to walk over a mile to the post office to sign for a small package that could have been delivered easily by the mail person to my apartment.

I know they say it is because of so called COVID but there are ways to get around that.

The mail person could have buzzed my apartment and left the package along with the sign in device at the lobby door of the building.

I could have walked to the lobby door and signed for the package (in the time it takes the mail person to fill out the card) and the mail person could have picked up the device after I got my package and left.

Since I am unable to walk that far I am going to have to take a Taxi on Friday,(after I get my pension), which is going to cost me an additional $20 to get the package to is worth $9.95 USD.

Thank you Canada post.

Joe"
"Parcel arrived in Mississauga, Ont and passed through customs on March 19th. On March 22nd, tracking shows still in transit. Finally got an update on March 24th saying item being processed in Richmond BC. I live in Nova Scotia and repeated questions to Can Post agent as to why it was sent to the opposite side of the country where there are already problems with their new delivery system resulted in a frustrating run around. I still have not received any further updates and not sure when I will receive my parcel. One other parcel shows delayed with no explanation and two others are still in mississauga.....shoddy and unprofessional ..."
"Two different completely unrelated packages coming from two different countries, both packages delayed for a week now. Obviously this has happened more than a few times with Canada post, especially considering the other reviews on this site, I'm just finally at my own wits end. You guys are bad... Like really, really bad at your jobs. The lack of reliable service has never not been consistent and I've procurued this observation for over ten years and three different home address (ie. delivery address). What ever you're doing, which can't be very much, it's not working and is taking to long. Thanks for nothing Canada post."
"I paid for express delivery Laval-Sherbrooke and it‚Äôs been 10 days. They didn‚Äôt deliver it in my mailbox like supposed to and I have to go pick it up at the center. However, when I went to the center, they said that it had already been picked up? They don‚Äôt even want to check if they have it. I still don‚Äôt have my package and I needed it for today. Next time, I will definitely use another delivery system."
They decided not to deliver any mail or parcels to the entire community because they don't feel like it. Post office must be loaded to the ceiling with packages. They also close 4/5 days and leave early every day.
Canada post parcel delivery from Edmonton to grande prairie Alberta is horrible it takes any where up to 7 days to be in transit from Edmonton wow that is horrible service
"Canada Post it's a black hole for parcels! Package expected within 2 days delivery, made it from Montana,US to BC to Edmonton,Ab in less than a day, and stuck in Edmonton for the last 3 days! It is unbelievable... Don't even try to have a big parcel coming from Europe, as the package came open, lots of missing items, and they just threw everything in a black garbage bag, including the broken cardboard box, and label it with Canada Post stickers... Customer service is useless, rude and unhelpful... Why are we even keep this business open and funded from our taxpayers money? What a disappointment, they have given up, and don't care about anything or anyone... Government funded, tells you everything you need to know!"
"they send my letter wrong place , than , they explain lots reason, nothing help, this is not first time, make me trouble . also bad services"
"I‚Äôve sent a simple letter, with tracking to the USA on the 8th. of March. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize it, but the person at Midland‚Äôs post office, marked it as Parcel! And now the 24th., the letter (marked as a parcel) is stuck at the mail sorting center in: Carol Stream USA.
Usually I never had any problems with sending items to the USA, or Europe, but another person was looking after the mail on the 8th‚Ä¶"
"literally the worst mail company ever! if i could give 0 stars i could. Not only do they send back my package without me knowing not once, but twice now!!! they always say how they‚Äôre going to open an investigation and follow up but never do it. If someone knows any decent mailing services let me know because as much as a big company as this one is, it sure doesn‚Äôt seem like it üòêand don‚Äôt even get me started on dealing with them on the phone. so frustrating."
"I would give 0 instead of 1 star if possible. Never ever had a satisfactory tracking experience. The tracking is totally separated from the actual facts. Must be some kid doing the programing. Every time shipment shows TODAY and at the end of the day is strangely changes to TOMORROW, Technology 21 Century!!!!"
"Item was supposed to be delivered 2 days ago via Expresspost. Says by end of day today and it is end of day and still not here. And there is NO customer service rep you can speak to, just a useless chat bot that gives you no real info. No where to file a complaint. You are left with no recourse through Canada Post. So much for Gtd delivery standard. Canada Post, your services suck as well as your non existent customer service. Shippers and customers beware. They dont even deserve a 1 star rating."
"Paid for mail forwarding service and I accidentally switched the forwarding address to the current address. I instantly tried to change the addresses but wasn't successful as I would need to pay again. Double/triple-check your addresses when purchasing mail forwarding as you cannot change it (even in immediate delays WITH help from customer service).

Thanks for the unjust enrichment Canada Post!"
"Honestly what has happened to Canada Post ? They charge you more for shipping service yet the delivery takes even longer than before the pandemic. 2 boxes were sent out on March 1 2023 from southern Ontario for a destination to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. We are March 20, the package still has not been delivered. The tracking goes from ""in transit"" to ""delayed"" constantly. This morning it was labelled as in transit now it is delayed once again. Called customer service they say the package ""should"" be delivered this week. Honestly 3 weeks and more for a package from southern Ontario to Saskatchewan ?"
Never ending problems. Where do I start from receiving other people's mail others receiving mine. Christmas cards being delivered 3 months late. Myself having to change all my bank accounts because of sensitive financial papers being lost in the mail. Continuous problems with online parcels not received because locker key was put in wrong mail box and person not returning but keeping the item. Last year alone had numerous service tickets to find items and mail. Two weeks ago ordered online product required to get my car on the road again locker key put in wrong mail box now lost. I had to reorder and have to wait another 2 weeks. Clearly frustrated and feeling a sense of helplessness as being a federal company really no recourse. If this was a private business would be defunct from poor execution of its service. As for date of experience ongoing last 5 years. Writing this review as a way of expressing my ongoing frustration.
"I phoned in to see how I could track flyers that I sent out for my business as I asked many people in my city where they should have been delivered and no one had received it yet.I was told there was no way to track individually where they went but they could open an investigation into where the flyers were distributed and when,except.since i ""shorted ""them on the amount of flyers they needed to fulfill the order that was not an option eithor.i dropped off 40 bundles of 250=10000 flyers and somehow they only had 9100??I asked why they didn't call me to let me know of the shortage and was told that it was my responsibility to make sure there was enough flyers.Im not sure how I could have done anything more than count the bundles before I dropped them off,if they were short and I paid to deliver them a phone call asking if we have more flyers would be a no Brainer you would think.The customer service is absolutely terrible I will never trust them with my advertising dollars again.What a joke."
Got an item coming to the uk it hasn‚Äôt updated me since the second it‚Äôs now the 16th it‚Äôs supposed to arrive today but I highly doubt it don‚Äôt recommend at all!!!
"Pure Garbage, getting even worst"
Fast pace my ass they can't even get one foot out the door with my package Canada Post
Canada post is a complete scam!! They lost my international express parcels. Twice!! There is no way for you to contact customer service or lodge a complaint. Avoid them as much as you can.
"Very disappointing customer service, For US delivery they did not alert me that I have to purchase tracking number and the importance of having it. Without tracking number you even cannot claim a missing package. And cannot get tracking number after sending your product using Your name and address, like any other companies. So when you send your package without tracking number, you have not access to ANYTHING!"
Parcel Delivery. Parcel LATE. Parcel Delivery Notifications not accurate. Parcel Delivered incorrectly. WORST EXP.
They have been saying expected delivery for 7 days now and it still have not arrived. It keeps saying item delayed but no reason why it is delayed. Worst possible service aswell. If i could give a -5 star I would. Overall they dont even give update as to where the package is it just keeps saying expected delivery then transit then item delayed.
I have a business and my hours are from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday Saturday Sunday till 2:00 to 5:00 Canada Post keeps on coming early before I even open and you can't get a hold of anyone except a recording this is the worst service I've ever had in my entire life and they keep on doing it they always come early and they should note my time already very pissed off to who it May concern if it's a business they should come back the same day to drop it off if they're early but they don't.
"Bad service! The worst in the world. No gps tracking or pictures showing where the parcel was delivered. Only a ""delivered to community bailbox"" to find out you have received nothing. No key, no notice. Scan saying delivered but nothing in the mailbox.
Do better Canada Post. I am out a lot of money because of your courrier ""mistakes""."
They have to stop losing packages and I heard on the news where emails have stolen packages and take them home.
Terrible They loose mail. Awful!
"Want to buy their guaranteed 1-2 day xpresspost shipping time! Well look anywhere but here! Paid for it and it took 15 days to arrive. Shipped within canada as well. Such a horrible mail service, just avoid it"
"This company never follows directions and that leads to me never getting my packages on time.

Stupid company with people that don't know how to do their jobs and are too lazy to do them."
"I was sending a package of supplies overseas to one of Canada's paralympic athletes and it was supposed to take 6 to 10 days. 5 weeks later I contacted Canada Post and the representative started to look into it for almost half an hour, until she put me on hold and then abruptly was told that because I didn't pay almost double to have it trackable, I was shoot out of luck. I had assumed that meant I wasn't able to track it personally which wasn't a huge issue. There was also no insurance because the items weren't damageable - I thought the service I was paying for (getting from A to B) was guaranteed!! Thanks Canada Post for being so untrustworthy and unhelpful, I'll know next time to just flush my money down the toilet instead."
"I love and trust Canada Post with delivering my packages. Love it and always happy to know when my package is being delivered by Canada Post, it means it will never get lost. I signed up for delivery notifications and notifications about expected packages by email, it worked out great for me. Last date of experience is 28 of February 2023, but the date keeps changing after I saved it."
I am really disappointed by the service I received from them . I haven‚Äôt gotten my order since the 5th of March and every time I am getting one excuse or the other . I have been crying since morning because I don‚Äôt know the condition of my order and can not track it at all . I have been giving different ticket number and nothing . Signed up for the text notification as well as email notification but nothing . I am just heart broken about this whole experience
they keep increasing their prices and also increasing their delivery time.
Another example of an utter waste of our tax money. Zero customer service and a sense from a lot of their employees they are better than everyone. So many bad experiences too name. Waiting for a package from Ontario to Nova Scotia has now been 12 days and looks like won't be here this week. No explanation or apology when called.
Worst postal service company ever. Honestly don‚Äôt even deserve a star at all
"Took the day off to wait for my very expensive and important delivery to arrive so I could sign for it, as it showed that the package was out for delivery when I checked in the morning. I waited by the door so as to not accidentally miss a knock or anything (they can be sneaky). Well, hours pass and I decide to check for any updates... and it says that they attempted to deliver?!?!? While I was sat there waiting close enough to my door that I could hear people walking outside, as well as being next to the giant window that shows the entire driveway and street. No knock, no doorbell, not even footsteps walking up to the door. There was also no sign of any delivery vehicle anywhere in my vicinity all day. I tried reaching out to the chat as well as over the phone and all I got was useless, about how the delivery driver had tried to contact me but could not and that I will now have to wait until tomorrow afternoon to go pick it up myself. One agent I spoke to told me that the driver didn't have a buzzer number on the label and so that must be why they couldn't contact me. I live in a house... the ""buzzer number"" would be my door bell. Incredibly frustrating writing off my day to wait only for it to be a massive waste (surprise surprise) and now have to reconstruct my day tomorrow to drive out and pick it up myself anyway. I usually avoid Canada Post like the plague for this very reason, but unfortunately they are not completely avoidable in most cases."
"I signed up for a 4-month mail forward service online.
Since I was unable to change my moving date on their online dashboard, I cancelled the service on DAY 1.
Apparently I will not receive a refund because I cancelled it on DAY 1, and that there are no refunds.
So I paid $69 for 1 DAY of service!
There was no mention of the service being non-refundable. I should take this to the consumer's protection services."
"Canada post is nothing but a money grab. paid $20 to send a small envelope parcel express from Belleville to Peterborough on March 1st, and they now say it won't get there until March 7th.
IT'S A 1.5 HOUR DRIVE for 20 bucks I could have just drove it to Peterborough myself and delivered it 5 days sooner.
They need to privatize Canada Post and just get rid of these ü§°"
"Will never, ever, again use Xpresspost. I needed to send legal documents to my lawyer so I took them to Canada Post in Hamilton Friday Feb 24 for 'next day service' to Mississauga. I paid extra for a signature hoping it would help ensure proper delivery. When the lawyer messaged me two business days later, I promised to look at the tracking, and found to my horror that it was in the process of being returned to sender. It wasn't until too late on Thursday March 2 that it showed up as available for pick up at the post office so I went Friday morning March 3. The worker was rude and dismissive, as well as unhelpful. She insisted there was nothing she could do about the fact that it had been correctly addressed and it was not delivered. Apparently I had to go back to the post office where I had sent it to talk to them. To add insult to injury, I had to pay a surcharge for Canada Post's error and incompetence in returning the item, just to receive it, so I could resend it. So I walked over to the UPS Store, and discovered in so doing that the only address visible anywhere online for that lawyer's office was the exact address I had given. There exists no suite number, as the Canada Post worker claimed, so there was no way that it should have been returned. It cost me less for guaranteed next day shipping with UPS and I am much more confident it will actually be delivered. Not only will I never, ever use Xpresspost again, I will be sure to let everyone I know not to use this service."
"Morning guys ,
I think the rifle has dissapeared in transit, was out for delivery yesterday , now it says it's in Manitoba. Very concerned and wondering why you sent this order in Mail. CPC has a 95% dissatisfaction rating on it's own site . Please advise me if it shows up on your end . I think sending things via this service is a roll of your dice. Anyhow something to think about. Thanks Doug"
"I disagree with people putting down Canada Post's reputation.
I have almost 50 years of receiving my mail with them... I am sorry but if one time something get's screwed up... or even twice .... it is not the end of the world!!! I am going to give them a full chance and effort to investigate and forgive Canada post for what ever has happened.
We are all humans on this planet, things happen.
I had a package that was emailed to me as delivered to my community mailbox... for some reason... the key to the community mailbox did not follow and no package was found by me.
I contacted Canada post with the number near my community mailbox area... within the 3 business days delay they gave me... this problem was resolved. I got my package. All the while... I kept calm.
.....Btw...who ever the Supervisor was on this case... He was effecient and stellar in regards to keeping me updated on my voice mail and contacting me by phone.
My experience with Canada post is still 5 stars.
I will support them because this Company is part of Canadian pride: HONEST, RESPECTFUL HARD WORKING, EFFICIENT AND THEY DO THEIR BEST!
FOR ANYONE PUTTING ANY OF THESE PEOPLE DOWN ... WHY DON'T YOU TRY DELIVERING MAIL IN THE EXTREME COLD WEATHERS OF Montreal or Canada... try doing a mailman's job when nobody clears the snow path for them... then complain.
Canada post deserves our full support. The staff should be treated well with utmost respect for all they do to get the mail to our doors; and they should all be well paid and recognized!!!!!!!"
Don‚Äôt even bother paying extra for an expedited shipping. It still gets pretty much delayed and they offer no resolutions. Tells you that it will be sent out on the next business day but it will stay like that for days
"Awful company‚Ä¶ says it‚Äôs been delivered but nothing was in the parcel, not even a key. What a joke."
Incompetent fools. Always losing packages and delivering to the wrong address. While customers are inconvenienced and have to do the work of trying to recover packages lost by idiot mail carriers.
"Paid for Expedited parcel from Edmonton to Vancouver.
CPC had in on Feb 22.
It was to be delivered BY Feb 23/24th.
March 1st & tracking shows ""a delay""?
Where is it?"
"I agree with Harley. If I could go lower than 1 star, I would. They are not a delivery company except for maybe envelopes. They are a hold for pickup company. Waiting all day for a ‚Äòdelivery‚Äô then finding a card in the mailbox is unacceptable when the buzzer was right beside the door. I will tell all companies I deal with now that I don‚Äôt want their products if they ship Canada Post. This has happened too many times now.
I wish I had checked out Trustpilot‚Äôs reviews of Canada Post before I had the parcel sent. Omg 95% dissatisfaction rate for over 5,000 reviews. The CEO of Canada Post needs to resign and replaced with a business person who gives a damn about customer service."
"extremely incompetent, and then they blame Amazon and FedEx and other large companies for getting them out of business.. maybe learn a thing or two from them? maybe actually delivering the package somewhat within the promised timeline? All i get from the tracking number is ""item is delayed, stay tuned for an update"" which is the same useless information I get when calling a useless agent, which takes forever to get to."
Paid for one day delivery. Took 4 days. They refused to give me a refund.
"takes weeks to ship something thats 4 hours away, proceeds to deliver it at the wrong place in my town. Haven‚Äôt gotten any updates"
"They refuse to leave packages at doors, want you to sign for a 5$ amazon package it‚Äôs completely ridiculous and they should all be fired for there horrible service"
I‚Äôm extremely unhappy with this delivery company. I ordered a few items from lasenza and a week later I still haven‚Äôt received my package. They haven‚Äôt updated the tracking in days! Very dissatisfied.
"If I could go less than 1 I would. 3 packages this week were damaged and no coverage for glass. The agent told me after I bubble wrapped and double boxed...which i did, to drop it from 6 feet. Then drop a 70 pound box on top of that. That is what it goes through in shipping even if it is marked fragile."
"I ordered a new phone and a new tablet, the tablet was delivered within 5 days after ordering it and it came sooner than estimated but keep in mind that ups delivered my tablet and it came from Kentucky USA which is 40 hour drive from me... my phone however has not arrived yet and it has been 7 days and was sent from Toronto which is literally the same distance give or take two hours... canada post never delivers before the expected delivery date and they constantly do the least they can in their business hours. My phone is sitting in Richmond now for 4 days and has not moved even though I'm only a couple hours from the sorting center
There is no reason for canada post to get weekends off. No government entities should get weekends. Just replace workers as they are almost entirely not all incompetent workers."
What's the point of paying extra for xpress post of you guys still take 1-2 weeks to deliver it? Why give that option if it's no faster? Damn crooks
They have not even attempted to deliver a package in a long time. Instead the carriers walk up and place the slip in the box with the mail or not at all. We work from home like many these days and there is absolutely no excuse for this. Instead they require every person to drive and pick up their packages. Think of the carbon emissions reduction if they actually just dropped off your packages while they were there‚Ä¶
"The guy never waited waited for me. I work home. Could see the truck in the street. He's has been carrying my parcel all day (more than 7 hours...) across the neighbourhood. The Post Office branch in 5 minutes from my place. I went there this evening no parcel yet... We are in Canada, it's cold out there and in those trucks! So be very aware of the risk of doing business with Canada Post."
"Horrible Horrible company.
They do NOT say WHERE they delivered a parcel.
Instead they deflect the issue to the sender @#$%^&&&
How crazy is that!
They decline any responsibility.
F*** them"
"Unreliable, disorganized & so difficult to work with. I won't use them or buy from anyone who uses them. I've been trying to resolve a mail issue with them for months and it is still ongoing. The amount of time and money I have wasted is so frustrating."
My package was supposed to come on the 15th of february but even after 5 full bussiness days (now the 21th) it still hasn't arrived and is still stuck in transit. Wth man
I wiah l could put a zero this is the worst Company ever they loose packages and they vanish into thin air and have endless investigations
"Mailed an expensive package Jan 5th, as of Jan 24th it was still in transit. By middle of Feb an investigation was launched and yes the package vanished. How does something just vanish? We deserve better service, especially with the high fees...oh and the extra gas surcharge...didn't I already cover that with the original shipping charge? Company needs a big overhaul."
They are absolutely criminals. If you can find any other way of shipping.. DO IT. They are raping the public for every cent they can. Horrible service and horrible experience.
"Horrible company. You can tell that every single person that works here does not care about a single thing other than punching in and punching out. Had a package get returned to sender because of an address issue. I put in a service ticket (which takes 5 business days for them to get to) and they sent it back in 3 business days because I guess that makes sense somehow. Also called my local sorting facility while it was being held. Lady on the phone said to just wait and it shouldnt be to long before they correct the issue. Their slogon is ""giving back to our communities"" Ha. Ha. Ha."
"How are these morons still even in business????? Useless employees to worried about scrounging for the next union raise and can't do the simple damn job of delivering mail properly.
Absolutely useless how is this government funded???"
"Canada Post is a sorry excuse for a delivery system. I mailed about 15 boxes from Manitoba to New Brunswick. I went to great lengths to properly package everything with foam wrap and styrofoam popcorn. Every package - not exaggerating - was damaged. It's as though they dropped every box off of a 5-storey building. I cringe every time I order something from EBay.ca and see that the seller has used Canada Post, as there is a very high likelihood that I'll never receive my item(s). Canada Post is a bloated, inefficient public sector entity that should be dissolved. Farm it out to the private sector where things will get done right. The organization is an embarrassment."
the product was given and they say it was sent to the destination. with a guaranteed delivery for overseas delivery it seems the product vanished in the air. seemingly they cannot track it. so how about we poor boings. $1000 plus $108 postage vanishes in the air space and the minimum time to track the object is one month. is that a Joke? one month? and still they say your item is delayed and stay tuned for updates. there must be some good burglars in the Canada Post. sent on the 1st of February 2023. not received as of 18 February 2023
"What is going on at Canada Post? My package was processed at their factory in Kitchener on February 14th. Since then it gets delayed by a day and since yesterday it's been ""in transit"" for the last 24 hours. Now their terrible tracking system just says ""delayed"" with no date in sight. I get delays happen since my last 2 orders were late by 2 days but this is getting ridiculous. I'm guessing I won't get my package until February 21st since this Monday is a holiday."
Where are my gift cards going when they never reach the recipient. I mailed a gift card at the end of Jan. It was never delivered to the person who should have received it. This is the fourth card that has gone missing.
"Canada Post is Pathetic! And should remove the Canada name from their company. Out of my last 20 packages through them they promised 14 of them will be delivered the next day, then after they have your money they change it to 4 days. I could have drove 2 hours to pick up those packages. It is seriously pathetic . Then they wine and go on strike cause they're not babied enough by there company with their 30 paid sick days a year and Mondays only doing half the package load. Pathetic!!!!!! Most Canadians do not like Your business! Stop liying and ripping people off!!!!! It's illegal but cause their a rich company they can say and do whatever they want."
"Bipolar agent messes with parcels, holds them hostage, yells and makes up policies. Does anything to make life more difficult for customers she does not like. Complaints have been submitted and nothing is ever done because of the union. Many unhappy customers that have complained to no avail."
"Always late. Never meet delivery date. Terrible service, never acknowledge their mistakes. Often blame it on the weather when the weather is perfectly fine. Definitely Not recommended. Such a shame to a courier representing Canada."
"My private parcel was suppose to come on Feb 11 2023. It did but apparently I got a text saying they knocked and rang the doorbell, when they didn't. My mom was home at the time and she heard nothing and saw no one. This company can improve by doing your job right and not be lazy and actually ring or knock. This happened so many times, now I don't even know if am gonna get my letter at all."
"Sent hundreds of parcels, first time submitting a damaged package complaint denied as the recipient didn‚Äôt take pictures of the label and packaging before throwing out! Just remember the insurance is a scam they will try everything to find a way not to pay! Clearly took no care with this package and I wasted more money on extra insurance"
"absolutely terrible. When delivering a package they won't even bother to ring the doorbell, knock on the door or anything. They are extremely lazy. when dropping off a parcel, your supposed to try to drop it off at the house not the mailbox on the street especially if you need a signature. waste of my gas and my time because I know have pick it up because someone else refused to do their job properly."
"Received birthday card in mail which unfortunately was opened. Called sender to thank and ask if anything was in envelope with card, fortunately, no. But still we seem to be experiencing some not so honest employee's within this organization. I do know it's not sorted in my home town, so it must have happened at the MAIN sorting station.

Not impressed!"
"Such a waste of a company. Inefficient, terrible support where you have to tell them 8 times you want to speak to an agent. Leaves delivery notice stating package will be available at a certain time, yes, its a now show. Operator says she knows nothing. What is the point of this sham. Canada Post is just plain useless."
"Multiple experiences in this specific store are beyond horrendous. Arrogant and incompetent staff. Repeatedly. Unfortunately - this is the CP that we have to use if we have to pick up mail. Different store on Yonge - St. Germain (store #1240) - complete opposite. Polite, helpful and knowledgeable/fast staff."
"Paid $22.22 for 4 day delivery. It didn‚Äôt come in Friday, nope. It didn‚Äôt even leave the area it was supposed to. Now it‚Äôs saying my package is going to be delivered 4 days after they said they were going to deliver it. I can‚Äôt pick it up at the warehouse and I cannot even get a human on the phone to correspond this situation. This company is soooo bad it‚Äôs laughable. I pity you Canada post, for not delivering because of ‚Äúflurries in the air‚Äù"
"Biggest joke of a company ive ever seen, why even put an estimated delivery date if you fail it everytime? Garbage workers too, your company should have been sued into the ground by now, I hope the owner goes homeless, making good money off the worst possible service provided by any courier."
What's the point of paying C$25 for 7-10 day guarantee if you're not going to honor it? Now it's up to 17 days. I'm never buying anything from Canada again.
"Those crooks lost there mind , for little package which is cost of 20$ I paid 20$ shipping within Canada?????? People , we are screwed. Plus fuel charges????? F.geeks"
"If there is such a thing as zero stars, I will give it! I mailed a package but realize after sending the mail that the address was wrong. By the next day, I called Canada Post and was told there is nothing that can be done about it. Nothing! I asked if it becomes undeliverable, will it at least be sent back to me. The representative said boldly ‚Äúno, it will be lost‚Äù. I cannot salvage the matter while it is within Canada and cannot salvage the situation after it becomes delivered. They couldn‚Äôt stop the delivery or change address or schedule a pick up at the destination post office. I never knew such an archaic and useless post office existed in the 21st century. How are they still in business????"
"They‚Äôre completely unreliable. The only thing you can count on them for is lost packages, delays, and no customer service."
"Delivered an item to the post office without any notification, or buzzer at my place. I had to manually check the status and got to know that it was delivered to the nearest post office. Moreover, they don't even accommodate the receiver's availability for any late deliveries. Worst service possible!"
Never trust them .i lost my two important parcel . No one take care about it. Have to call again and again . Never update anything . Never choose it.
"If I could give a zero stars, I would. This is the very worst postal company in the world. Shipped a parcel that followed all regulations and paid a small fortune, only to be told my package was undeliverable. When I called after checking the tracking number for weeks and it saying that my package was just delayed. I'm told it was destroyed. WHAT A BS POSTAL SERVICE WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY !!!!"
"If there was an option to choose postal service, I would never choose Canada Post. It is not the first time they left notice cards even there were people at home.
One time they left the notice card on 23rd January and normally it is available for pickup for 15 calendar days. But when I came to pick up on 6th Feburary which was before 15 calendar days, it was already returned. So I claimed for this and they just say I should talk to the sender and the sender said he could refund except for shipping fee. I don't know why I should waste few hours in this and lose my money for their mistakes. All they said was they could take no action for this. They are so annoying and have no responsibility."
"My item ( bag with 23 kilos ) was received by Canada post Renfrew Ontario December 12, 2023. It is now February 7th , and still haven't received my item in Winnipeg nor any updates.
,,"
"By far the worst delivery service, they delayed my package for a month (probably lost it). And their support chat bot always glitches out and will never transfer me to an agent. They would be completely sued out of existence if they weren't a crown corporation."
"someone check my math,,
If United state post office handled 129 billion pieces in 2021 for 77 billion dollars that .59 cents a piece.
Canada handled 6.7 million pieces in 2021 for 10.7 billion dollars thats $1597.00 per piece..."
I regret using Canada post. How can a package be sent to me and was told I rejected it and it‚Äôs been sent back to the sender when nothing got to me. Very frustrating experience
"The first time I trust you with something super important!!!!!!! an original copy of my wife's death certificate!!!! Paid for all the"" bells and whistles "" be there in one day----tracking number...paid for the top service . What happens....5 days later...you have no idea where it is....yet you said you could track it!!!!! Next day delivery guarantee...5 days later...they don't know where my traceable package is!!!!!!!! Of all things to track... what can't be tracked..was the original copy of my wife death certificate!!!!!!!! So I call....here is your ticket number!!! Eventually we will get back to you!!!"
"I don't like to write negative reviews but Canada Post should not be delivering parcels. I paid three times the shipping to get my parcel in two days. The shipping company went out of their way to ensure it was in Canada Post's hands. The tracking on that day said they had received it and processed it. The next day they said I would get it the day after. Today is that day and the tracking says it would come at 12:30 pm. This was updated at 6:30 pm. My concern is that the tracking yesterday said they just received the electronic information from the shipper. I don't know how that can be since they had already processed it the day before. I do know I did not get it. I checked the canoe by my barn because of all the delivery companies Canada Post is the only company that likes to deliver it to my canoe. This despite me trying several times thought Canada Post to explain I would like it delivered to the house or mail box, both of which are obvious, rather than hidden down where I store my canoe.
For the love of God and all things Canadian lets not embarrass the country more by being able to deliver mail every day to the mailbox but not a parcel ever.
If everyone boycotted Canada Post parcel service then we would not have to put up with Canada leading the way showing the world how not to get a package from point a to point b."
"Canada post is the absolute worst, get rid of Canada post."
If I could give a negative review to Canada post I would have given it. I paid for priority service was given a guaranteed next day delivery I paid for a return label also. They delivered my passport to the embassy 1 day late and also after 12pm so my visa wasn‚Äôt processed on time. The return shipment was 2 days late and the didn‚Äôt process the envelop properly because I required a signature as I needed to travel. The screwed me twice so I had to pay for my flight twice that‚Äôs 1700 each *2 so that‚Äôs a lot of money and every time I called the would make up an excuse now my landlady isn‚Äôt around and I have to wait for her to come back before I can get my document and pay for another flight ticket before I travel. Canada post is a disgrace and huge disappointment üëéüëéüëé you need to reevaluate your understanding of the word guarantee.
Driver went to wrong house. Item shipped from ontario to alberta. 5 minutes after wrong house he put on shipping back to ontario. I called within 20 minutes and they could not stop it as it was already in the system. First support guy laughed at me and hung up on me. The second said there is nothing they can do once its in the system. Great. Ship back 3000km cause he went to wrong house. Then back. Greenies would have a field day with this. What a crap system they have. Never use again.
Canada post has failed time and again to deliver packages to me with startling consistency. They employee that did show up when they finally did was rude aggressive and left without giving me any information as to how I could get my package. I genuinely think Canada post should be embarrassed and ashamed of how puss poor they're performance is.
Melissa and Vidya are always awesome. They always welcome me with a smile and I appreciate their patience. Thanks to you both!!! The location is in SE Calgary McKenzie Town.
Just Terrible. They never rang the doorbell and just left a notice in my mailbox to pick up my package the next day. It happened 3 times this month. Not happy with their service.
"Terrible service. All these reviews speak volumes. Hostile and transphobic workers. They cannot wrap their tiny minds as to why I don't have an up to date ID when I'm broke, have no idea how to even change my ID, and I literally moved to a new home/city in March 2022 AND in December 2022 (so, they're completely puzzled why i don't have an ID when i've been here for A MONTH?? It doesn't have my name either to be fair but i perfectly explained WHY and supplied so much proof that I AM ME.)
Refusing to release my package (do NOT give me that bs about how it is protocol, i was able to show the exact label the package had last time and was able to pick it up)
The name on the package wasn't even the name I go by, because they somehow messed it up and put ""katien beau"".. what? that's my email address, not my name... showing them my lease agreement with BOTH my legal name and new name did not help, email address, package notice on my door, etc.
Noooope, need an ID. So I have to bug my roommate to help me pick it up when they're sick with COVID and are extremely busy with their kids and work. The nerve. Do the world a favour and neck yourselves. Scum. Oh yeah, and I suddenly have to pay to pick it up now, too. Awesome!"
"I've never had any problems with Canada Post deliveries.Keep up the good work!
Happy camper.."
"a package was sent to a post office for pickup on the 27th of January and the tracking says notice card was sent but I didn't get one, when a parcel is delivered to a post office for pickup we should get the notice card the same day not after, I've had the same experience a couple weeks ago, and when i got the notice card it was dated for 2 days ago"
Always a bad service. The delivery service is the worst. All the time changing dates. Never on time.
"Takes more than one month to deliver a parcel from montr√©al to qu√©bec, i could of walk and i would of been faster. And poor service too, all they can say about it is : it usualy doesn't take this long to deliver a parcel, it must of had some complication. That does't explain much does it."
"Doesn‚Äôt get any worse. Expecting a shipping. Small box. Received no tracking info. Arrived one week later than stated date. They arrive home (apparently) and turned around with my package. I receive an SMS saying ¬´ no safe place to leave the parcel ¬ª - totally false. I need to reschedule shipping AND pay extra, with only two dates options, separated by 3 days. Far in time. The redirect URL link looked fraudulent. Same for the info and payment page. Full if unclickable logos. Asking for my birthday date. WHY?? Terrible experience."
"What's the point in spending all that extra money to insure a package ?
It arrived completely wrecked . Pictures before sending after sent . Still not enough to get a claim in my favor.
The problem is that they are so big with no real competition.
Well they are one customer less now. I vow never to use Canada post again for anything .
On a personal note .
Louis from the claims team needs some common sense training .
Cut and pasted robotic answers infuriated me **@*@**!"
"Website glitchy! Had to reenter my information multiple times to set up mail forwarding. Terrible all around. Difficulty verifying ID, the last step in the process of setting up mail forwarding. Info has to match ""government issued ID"", which it did. Called customer service and was told it matches Equifax information, not my government ID. Now I have to go into the post office to get it sorted. Royal pain in my ass."
"Canada Post lost my international package then didn't even refund the full value of what I paid for it. Correspondence was also quite disappointing. Probably never using Canada Post again, which as a Canadian feels terrible to say."
"Canada post has been telling me that my package would be received ""today"" for almost a week now, even before it had passed customs. Now I have just received a text message that they have failed to deliver my package because ""no one was home"" despite someone having been home all day and seeing no one try to deliver any package and no note at my door. I am now being asked to repay for delivery and that I will not receive it for another week. Very poor service."
"Pathetic!!! Liars!! Twice now when a package was to be delivered to my house, it was never delivered although the individual with Canada Post states, they made an attempt to deliver the 2 separate packages!! Both times I was home! ! From there, the packages were sent to my nearest post office without a slip to pick them up Customer Service at Canada post have no empathy for customers ! They all sound like you just woke them up when you call. Canada Post needs to step up their game or employ people that are efficient!!!"
"Canada Post is the worst carrier I have ever dealt with.
How can you say ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù then you don‚Äôt end delivering the package?
What is wrong with your delivery drivers? Like get things done right for crying out loud! Get your stuff together! Jeez. Unnecessary stresses for no reason yikes"
"This is the second time in 3 months that my package has been lost by Canada Post. The first time they put the wrong shipping label on it and sent it to the wrong person. This time they just ‚Äúlost‚Äù it, and are currently doing an investigation into locating it. Keep in mind it was supposed to show up on the 13th, the investigation is going on until the 24th and then they will contact me about it. Absolutely awful customer service."
"Would put zero stars if i could... they lost a package that managed to go from a war zone in ukraine to canada only to be lost here. It was to be delivered to a flexdelivery adress... how incompetent can you be?

Will never user canada post again and any sellers that use it will not be bought from."
"An update. It has been three months and no word Canada Post. What gives Canada Post?
this person Mary K. is NOT doing her job, does answer her phone ever nor does she reply to e-mails.
This woman must be sitting in a corner of the building collecting pay and drinking coffee.

"The delivery came late and they didn't bother to knock just left a note at my door saying I can pick it up the next day at a facility. I'm disabled so now I have to pay a taxi cab to take me to this place and back, So I wrote about my experience with their customer support I just wanted them to know what happened and my ticket was closed instantly without any warning."
"I was working at home and yet driver made me go to the post office to pick my parcel.

such a waste of time"
"I paid for an express mail fees to ensure fast delivery of a package. The address needed correction. The customer service was contacted and a ticket was opened with the corrected address.
The package was put forward to return to me as the sender!!! When called to clarify why the package to return to the sender and the address has already corrected by a ticket? the answer was ""correcting the address with a ticket does not necessarily be taken by Canada post""!!
Why to open a ticket?
Just because!! no mandate to make any correction!!
Why to call a customer service?
Things does not go as per customer's expectations and needs!!!!
This is ridiculous!"
"I received notice that my shipments arrived at my building on Jan 4th, yet there was no key for me to access the Community Mailboxes! A site inspection was finally done at my building on the 16th only to discover my 2 shipments were nowhere to be found. :( very frustrating!

Tips! Make sure to put your apartment number first and make special request to have your shipments delivered directly to the concierge vs. a community mailbox. The headache is just not worth it! :/

The only good thing about this experience was that Canada Post customer service was good, communicated with me several times about my issue and I dealt with the supervisors to try to rectify the problem.

At the end of the day tho, there was no resolution. Luckily because I had shipping insurance, the sender is resending my items in a month.

All's well that ends well but lesson learned! No community mailbox for me. :/"
"Highly unprofessional and shame on you, Canada Post!
They are not checking if they could send to the country or not. I would recommend to check on their website before going to any office. They accepted my letters and after 1 months it came back with notes that the service was suspended. The interesting thing that post in the USA which were involved in sending one of the letter told that to I could get a refund. But when I came back to Canada Post they don't accept any refund. They accepted the service, didn't deliver and don't care about refund. I have to call CC to dispute the transaction."
I tried to send a gift to my friend for Christmas. Sent it out Dec 10th or around that date. They sent it back to me and I had to send it again. Now its still not there and coming back to me again a third time. I checked the address it was all there. Still waiting since Dec 10th this is ridiculous. I heard the Sudbury post office had issues i have to agree Someone could have called me. When I first went to send it the 2nd time in Niagara falls Lundys lane location I was treated badly by a young man who told me he worked for shoppers not the post office. He continued on to annoy me with his comments. I hardly doubt with all this trouble in 2 citys I will ever use them again. Customer service at NF location was terrible. Sudbury they just have no idea whats going on. Worst Christmas ever.
"I have been waiting for my letter sent by express for 10 days, each time they delay it for tomorrow. They can't find my letter missing. They say that we will inform them in 1 week. For my letter, which should arrive in 2 days, they will only inform after 15 days. It was a very important document for me that I will never forgive you. I will never work with you again from now on"
"Company makes no sense they keep packages in their vehicle but have no interest in delivering. Simply a notice. They are wasting fuel like this, just email me to come down to your office instead of pretending like you're going to deliver something you never do."
"Use any shipping service EXCEPT CANADA POST

YOUR PACKAGE WILL SAY ""Expected Delivery: Today"" AND IT WILL NEVER SHOW FOR WEEKS"
"If I could give - 5 stars I would. My item was received by Canada post December 22. It is now January 16th, and still haven't received my item nor any updates. This isn't first time this fiasco happened to me with Canada Post. This is one terrible shipping service. Never go with Canada Post when ordering merchandise from over seas. Go with UPS or DHL and avoid Canada Post like plague."
"Absolutely unacceptable service.
Although Canada Post erred in providing a timely delivery of my parcel going from NB to Ontario by shipping it all the way to Vancouver then Winnipeg and finally to its destination, they also failed to provide a safe delivery by leaving said parcel on the front veranda facing a street with heavy pedestrian traffic. The agent at Canada Post had assured me this would not happen as the receiver would be contacted by phone regarding the late package. Not so. Upon calling Canada Post regarding the matter, I was informed that it was my and the receiver‚Äôs problem. They could do nothing about it .
Why tell me one thing and do another?
Where is the accountability?
Why is the mailing depot where the error was made regarding the correct delivery route not held accountable?"
"Second time that my mail delivery person steals a package from an adult shop. Manages to deliver the other ones but always marks the adult novelties as ""delivered"" but never actually delivers it. It's so strange. Also doesn't help that they give us the wrong mail a few times a week. Wish our old mail delivery person did not retire, their replacement is an incredibly rude and frankly a bit unsuited for mail delivery.

Every day she is on her phone the entire route and leaves it on speaker-phone so everyone can hear her conversations that are NOT appropriate to have while working - the topics of some of them probably explain why she marks our adult packages as delivered without delivering them.

A nasty piece of work, most definitely. I have debated recording what she says to us when we ask about packages that have been marked as delivered. The issue is if we say anything to her our mail delivery gets even worse.

What kind of gestapo/mob tactics does Canada Post employ against people who want their mail? I am not able to inquire about packages that never reach me without her retaliating by delivering our mail to the streets around us (same number, different street) or leaving notes about not being able to deliver for no legitimate reason. It's a cruel system.

What can a regular citizen do? Open a ticket with Canada Post? Good luck, they do absolutely nothing. Open a dispute with the company you purchased the item from, explaining it was not delivered? Good luck as the mail delivery person marked it as delivered to our address. The burden of proof is on the customer, but how exactly does the customer reasonably prove a package that has been marked delivered, was not delivered?

At least the pension is good. This is our experience in St. Catharines, Ontario, in our small neighbourhood. I hope anyone reading this has better experiences."
"Awful service. Customer service (Sharon in this case) is even more incompetent. You come into my building and into my mailbox to leave a notice, but the thought of actually contacting me to deliver the package WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY THERE is too much effort? Pathetic."
Me and partner had packages coming the same day from the same company. They delivered his but ‚Äúleft a notice‚Äù for mine 10 minutes later. I obviously did not receive the notice. In the past 3 years I‚Äôve received the notice card maybe twice. The workers are incredibly lazy and will rarely even come to the doors of our townhouse. Literally any other shipping/freight company is better. Embarrassing company
"Why do you guys drop my parcel off at a pickup station and then an hour later, personally leave a notice card on my door knob? You guys literally drove to my house, got out of your vehicle, walked to my front door, left a notice card on my door (without ringing), and then leave. Why didn't you just bring my parcel with you in the first place? I see the tracking online so I'm fully aware that my parcel will be arriving and deliver today. You don't need to leave a card telling me that it's here. You're planning on coming to my front door later into your work shift so you might as well just bring my parcel with you rather than a notice card.

You made two trips for my parcel. Literally a waste of time and gas for both party. Do better please!"
"My parcel had been dropped off at the wrong building. Honest mistakes can happen, but this isn't the first time. Our building manager thankfully noticed it and brought it over to mine. This can be corrected by hiring more competent employees that maybe take a little bit more pride in their work and do not rush, training won't fix the issue."
"Ordered something 28 January, was meant to be delivered by express post, by 6 January, by 10pm it was changed and it was another 4 days so the 10 January it would be delivered! Once again, at 10 pm, it‚Äôs still in transit! So again not delivered!
This has come from leamington ON and 2 weeks later it‚Äôs in Mississauga! It‚Äôs needs to be in NB! So clearly not getting delivered! Once again still no update of when it will be delivered!! Once Again! The worse postal service EVER!! And NOT acceptable! They have a cheek charging the prices they do! And looking at reviews, it‚Äôs happens often!"
"Worst service ever. It has taken over two weeks to deliver a package that cost me $850 from Ontario to Alberta. I got all excited yesterday as it was supposed to be a day early. They failed. Now, ""unexpected delay."" No new ETA."
"Last week, they dropped off a package labeled for someone else at my address.

Today, they delivered my package to the wrong address.

Attention to detail and customer service is non existent.

Companies should use a more reliable source of delivery. FedEx, UPS, Loomis.

Ps. I was home when the apparent delivery was made, I saw no vehicles pull up."
"Y‚Äôall should try their xpresspost, ITS AWESOME WITH THE SAME DAY OR NEXT DAY DELIVERY‚Ä¶..LIKE MY PARCEL HAS BEEN IN TRANSIT FOR 24 DAYS! They must have the best of the best on the job as I believe the mail man is taking it old school and delivering my package ON FOOT."
They are too lazy to deliver to door for signature and just leave a notice over and over again. Made a complaint and nothing changed. Second time I was not even called back. Automated bot is useless and harmful. Privatise and replace Canada Post with Amazon now!!! Only Amazon gives good service.
"Funny how I gave this review then right after that ,all of a suddenly the parcel that was out for delivery all of a suddenly says verifying recipients addresses! I had to come baxk online to this review and add this to! If I could give 0 stars I would. Everytime there is a new mailperson ony route they mess up everytime. Constantly dropping my items off to several neighbors places instead. If they can't read why hire them? I even had one take my item worth over $400. I made a complaint and it was dropped off open and the contents were put in a plastic bag. Horrible service for parcels. As for letters they are fine. I wish there was more training like learn to read the address oh and how about going to the proper address and get a signature too. Also don't leave a pick up parcel notice at persons home. When they were home. With the people knowing their item was out for delivery. Go ring the doorbell or knock on the door to drop off parcel!! Who cares if they want to get off work early. You applied for a job knowing what it entails. Why do a half a** job? Tired of every new person who is hired. Double and quadruple check their police records too!"
"Garbage customer service. No ethics. They bring their attitude in to everything. Rarely do you come across a rep that‚Äôs actually friendly. They gave my package to my dad who does not live at my address and they refused to give it to me. My packages never get delivered even when I‚Äôm home and they always just leave a tag. Just the worst and I avoid them whenever I can and use purolator, or fedex. They do illegal things, withhold packages, refuse redelivery (basically steal from you).


The worst branch where I have had the most problems is the one inside the registry on 33rd Ave (Marda loop in Calgary, Alberta). They gave my package to my father who does not live at my address, did not show his ID and the package was addressed to me, furthermore earlier that day they refused to give me my package when I provided a letter addressed to my address from service Canada, my id (which did not have a matching address, but that is why I brought mail from the government of Canada!!, I also had the door tag that they left in my mail box and the shipping order proof on my phone). They also refused to do a redelivery and then when I told them to just give me my f***ing package, they told me to ‚Äúget the f*** out‚Äù.

My dad went in later. He does not live at the address the package was addressed to. He showed my ID (without me being there) and my service Canada letter and they gave him the package no questions asked.

I think this situation was very unethical and possibly illegal in Canada posts part. I made a complaint, but all I got was an email saying: ‚Äúthanks for submitting your complaint, your ticket has been recorded‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I wonder how many complaints they have backloaded that they do absolutely nothing about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
"This company from top CEO to bottom has no shame!
Look at the reviews, what a joke...I came on this site to leave a review but reading some that were left by others made me realize it's no use! Fire the lot of them and start fresh...many out there looking to prove themselves and I believe they will do better. I like to leave a negative review, unfortunately I can't.

So far no Package that cleared customs 26 Dec and tracking has not budged since!
This company is for real, LOL!"
"Unfortunately no respect for thier delivery schedule and time they put themselves. Also chat agent support not helpful at all, keeping asking you the questions in circles without any meaningful help. Worst service and customer support I have seen so far."
"Horrible experience. Bad customer service, no communication, lying about delivery date. I wish i could never use them again. Luckily i live close enough to the border where i will ship literally everything to from now on. Do not touch Canada Post."
"Yet again another damaged letter. Literally can‚Äôt order anything you don‚Äôt want damaged. Might as well just pick whatever it is up yourself because they obviously don‚Äôt care.
Hmm the giant letter sized envelope feels kind of stiff? Jam it in a hole half its size and absolutely RUIN what was supposed to be framed. Can‚Äôt do that with vicious creases in it. Thanks for costing me more money.
Absolute garbage postal service. Time and time again this has happened but they take no accountability.
Just GARBAGE"
"They marked a package a delivered, but never delivered it. I live in a building with 24 hour concierge, so it can't have been stolen. They just lied about the delivery and refuse to do an investigation to find the package."
"I ordered a Christmas gift with a $40 plus tax premium shipping attached to it and it‚Äôs still not here. Saw an update this morning that they had an issue verifying my address. I called and after 3 hours finally verified it, to which they told me I now need to wait another week, even though the facility is 20 minutes from my home. I then got a quick hang up when asking if I could help out possibly and pick the parcel up. Seems to be an awful lot of horror stories on here about them. It‚Äôs funny because before you speak to the agent they ask you to be polite, the agent who answered was beyond ignorant and rude for no reason. YCP you‚Äôre in for one in 2023 if this is how you treat all your customers."
Delivery date was scheduled for December 19. It was express post but never received notice until December 21. After opening a service ticket customer service came back and said express is not guaranteed in peak season which I cannot see stated on their website and the notice was apparently left on the 20 which it was not. Not good service and ridiculous high price. Do not recommend!!!
"many time re-scheduling the delivery. with the tracking number,i know my parcel was in victoria bc on december 30 th 2022. i had a notice of out for delivery for that day. when the truck of post canada came,the driver have not taking the parcel for delivery because it was a 2 persons for handling that parcel. i understand it was a safety concern,but why not found a second person.it was the first re-scheduling. they do not deliver on week end. because first and second of january was stat holiday,there was not delivery. on january 4th,another re-scheduling for the next business day. do i will receive my parcel on january 5th.....maybe"
"Always losing packages, worst shipping company ans when toi try to call their customer service u wait 2 hours on hold and still no response absolutely ridiculous. DO BETTER."
"Absolutely terrible , said out for delivery 4 days in a row then delayed at the end of every day , avoid at all costs"
"Not a single piece of mail has been delivered to anyone in my neighborhood since BEFORE Christmas (Dec 23). We have spent hours upon hours trying to reach someone at Canada Post who can provide us with any information on when our mail will be delivered. Multiple tickets have been made, all receiving ZERO response back from Canada Post. I was told via email to phone CP, so husband phoned and sat on hold for 4 hours with no answer. Of course they stop accepting calls prior to 5pm, so getting through to a customer service representative is near impossible. Its shameful, embarrassing, and completely absurd that Canada Post, a company deeming themselves an ""essential services"" while simultaneously refusing to deliver customers mail in a timely matter, refuses to acknowledge the mail delays, and refuses to answer anyone's inquiries about it. I will be filing a formal complaint with Canada Post Ombudsman. Horrible, HORRIBLE experiences with this terrible ""company""."
"About a month ago, I sent a package and paid for 2days guaranteed delivery. It was late by a day but that ment a lot for us. When I opened a ticket on the website, I was answered that due to the peak season the delivery guarantee is extended by one business day, which I was not informed at the post office. Plus I paid again when I got the package back.
I would not recommend this service."
"Good old Post Canada (PC) never changes.... Slower than slow as usual. Unfortunately, I had to use xpresspost for the shipping of travel documents - I wish I had the option with FedEx. 24-48 hour delivery is guaranteed by PC and I only live 1 hour away from where the package was being processed yesterday (Friday). I have been checking PC website a few times today and also chatted with agent online. Status is In transit, but no one can tell me if and when I should expect receipt of the documents. I may have to cancel my flight abroad at the last minute. PC staff I exchanged with didn't care! It's a 0 on 5 for me!"
"Canada has become a mass immigration experiment gone wrong and Canada post is the perfect example of a lack of standards that we no longer hold because of it!

Unreal how pathetic this courier has become and nothing will be done about it. Its sickening!"
"My package was suppose to be delivered today and it had customs fees required to be paid, luckily I was able to pay for them the day before after receiving an automated text message about it as I was highly anticipating this package before the new year as it was coming from overseas and was already sitting around in parcel transit hell due to the holidays. I had to go out for something and was unable to be home, but luckily I have family members at home who were able to sign and receive it, but today seems like the worst possible person to deliver packages was in charge and based on what my family told me, the deliveryman barely understood English and barely knew how to handle the tools given to him to properly sign it off to them, it was a frustrating experience and after not knowing the package was already paid for, he likely assumed there was some error and refused to hand the package over, telling my family that he will deliver it again next week and then promptly leaves. Maybe he's following the proper procedures of his job but how does this even make sense? He drove all the way to my location, made sure the address was right, looked at his digital device(s) to confirm whatever, then because something happened where he didn't understood why, he just leaves without at least giving some sort of form/paper to tell the receiver that the package is being held somewhere until further notice? The worst part is that he scanned the package to confirm it as ""DELIVERED"" while not even actually delivering the package! The package at this point could literally be stolen by him or thrown into a ditch and I can't do anything about it! Previous Canada Post Deliverymen would always leave a note about the circumstance and usually they drop my packages off at a nearby location for me to be able to pick up, this guy DID NOT! For all I know, my package is long gone by now. I came home thinking I was going to be opening my package and looked around the entire household thinking my family was pulling a prank on me by hiding it, I didn't know what happened to it because there was no way to know the current status of my package, everyone at home at this time left to go to work or went to do their own thing. I had to go through some headaches with customer service later that day and I still am not feeling assured that I will ever receive my package, what's worse is now no Canada Post workers will be working on the new year weekend, so I won't know the fate of my package until many days later. Canada Post doesn't even deserve this 1-star rating but it's required to for my review to go through. I rarely hate things but today, I REALLY hate Canada Post."
"- the web site update is not accurate; got a delivery notice slip when site says still in transit
- delivery notice slip is randomly in mail box or on the front door handle
- delivery notice slip was stuck on the front door, and the person ran to the car (front door camera recorded)
- if the delivery person took the trouble of coming to the house, then just bring the package anyways?
- just send out e-mail notifications instead of paying workers that don't delivery packages, but doing the same job as an e-mail?"
"if I could put zero on this.

always slow

always delays

I cannot understand why everytime I‚Äôm using tue Expedited shipping options; it takes ages
more than regular shipping

been a while since COVID; stop blaming this for inconsistency"
"Any reason i pay for shipping and all they do is deliver a card in mailbox and I have to go pick it up? If you can't handle delivery like it's supposed to be, get outta the game! You suck!"
"Canada post is the slowest. My package is said to arrive around 27 of december but didn't arrived ,it became the 28th and it didn't arrive, now canada post gave me new update they said that the package will be deliver the next day. it so frustrating."
"Needs to be dissolved. Very unreliable and complain about already great working conditions.
This conversation comes up a lot amongst canadians."
"One letter, with tracking, from Montreal to Quebec City: $17 dollars in postage. Deposited 23 December, expected arrival 28 December. 5 days to travel 250 km. Granted, it was the holiday period. But if we take off 24/25, that's still 3 days.
Luckily it is not under time pressure, but this service seems to me to be slow and overpriced."
Mail usually comes on Tues am still not arrived
VERY BAD. ITS DEC. 23 AND THEY SAID IT WAS COMING TODAY AND IT DID NOT ARRIVE. I KNOW THEY ARE NOT DELIVERING ON SAT AND SUN ESPECIALLY CHRISTMAS OR EVEN THE 26. SO NOW WHAT??? NOW IM GOING TO WAIT TILL PROBABLY JAN 4 TO RECEIVE MY PACKAGE. THIS LITERALLY SUCKS.
"Thanks to you scumbags , my kids won't get their gifts from dad because of how lazy your company is. Paid for your flat rate box and was shipped last Tuesday and now here it is next Friday Dec 23 and my kids are out of luck thanks to you scumbags"
"First of all let me say that I was supposed to get my package Dec 21,to my surprise no package. Checked the app,moved to Friday Dec 23,ok great just in time for xmas.
Day of delivery,get notification saying ‚Äúout for delivery ‚Äú YIPPEE‚Äù. Check the app again a few hr later,return to warehouse,will deliver next business day. So its now gona be basically another week before my package is here. Gimme a break. Clowns"
Been waiting for a package for about a month and a half now and it keeps saying delayed but won‚Äôt give a reason I‚Äôve contacted the seller and the shown sufficient proof that it was actually sent. I‚Äôd give 0 stars if possible.
"Worst shipping company on planet earth. Ridiculous overpriced, NEVER on time. Fail to make every delivery within guaranteed time frames, horrible excuses may as well just say they're lazy government workers."
Awful always has delays!! Had a delivery day changed 3 times!! Pay extra and go with fedex
"For over 40 years, Canada Post has never let me down once. In fact, they have only surprised me. The tracking is always accurate, and up to date. More times than not, my package usually comes a day earlier than anticipated. Thank you, for your dedicated service, and saving Christmas for my family this year."
"I was late sending the package this year. Canada Post delivered it today, December 21, 2022, it arrived at the destination days ahead, making it a great Christmas for my daughter. Thank you, Canada Post!"
Canada post is about as useful as a bag of wet hair.
"My priority package was sent to Strathmore by mistake instead of Lethbridge. They missed the delivery date. When I called to ask when I would get it, one agent told me it would arrive the next day. It didn‚Äôt. Another told me it would arrive in 2 days. The next agent told me it would arrive in 10 days. The last one I spoke to said it wasn‚Äôt trackable and they had no idea when it would arrive. Absolutely incompetent service."
"Canada post lost my package and there were no proper investigation into what happened to my package, they just informed me that the item was lost and that I must contact the seller for a refund. This package came from Nike so I don‚Äôt think it was lost but stolen by Canada post employees and unfortunately they are getting away with this. I will never use this useless service again."
"Terrible Service!
My package was originally scheduled on Tuesday delivery to a business address. Canada Post somehow decided to do the delivery on Sunday, when the business was closed. Then Canada Post transferred my package to Penguin pickup, which is far away from the delivery location. No more arrangement for redelivery."
My package was in Stoney Creek and rerouted across the province for what reason? Absolute dog water service. Will never ship with them again this is the 3rd time now in just over a year. Only ever have issues with Canada Post.
"Why offer various delivery prices pending the number of days delivery service if you cannot meet them. Consumers should be reimbursed for the difference. Don't offer services you cannot provide. 3 day service so far extended to 8. Sad when package has been 75km from my residence the 2nd day, and went to another distribution place 40km from me ever since. Never again. Not dependable at all when you're paying for timely delivery."
"Waiting for a package being sent from Mississauga to Guelph, it's been misdirected send to Woodbridge first then back to Mississauga then to Guelph now,they are having to reconfirm address, Canada Post your pathetic. I hope your all out of a job in the future."
"ANOTHER UPDATE 3rd Jan. 2nd parcel has arrived. Phew!! Too much stress.
UPDATE 23rd Dec. 1 parcel has arrived!
2 parcels sent from UK on 28th November 2022, it's 15th December now and no sign of either of them arriving in BC. Surely they can't both be lost! I am not impressed and will not be using Canada Post in the future. Make sure you pay extra for tracking, sadly I didn't."
"If I could give them less than one star, I would! This company is absolutely garbage."
This is not even one star is triple 00000000 star I went in with prepaid box and they charged me 33 dollars when I went back told them they were like its my fault well I think they suck at there job and they don't give a crap I hope you go have another job cause you not good at what you do this is for stoney creek location. to get the money back I had to go back with both recites just causecthey were who messed up .well thank you canada post
"I would give zero stars if I could..Canada Post is a joke!!..Ive never met so many morons then the morons working for Canada Post then the morons in Spruce Grove Alberta..what a waiste of space these morons are..Cant track,cant deliver cant help ya with anything because they are to stupid to figure anything out on there own."
"To many incompetent people work for Canada post ..l hope to see this entity
Fold like a sandwich ...Can you imagine there 1 employee stole 10s of thousands of parcels ...How many employees are not getting caught ...lm tired of my parcels going missing .
And waiting weeks for a resolution .Your scum Canada post ,thieves .Paid by tax payers ..who should divorce your sinking corporation."
"this is the worst delivery organization i've ever experienced, along with 5000 or so other negative reviews about Canada Post figured i'd add my 2 cents. the amount of times my address has been deemed undeliverable is staggering even though no other company has any issue with delivering my packages. I really wish there was an option or a way to see which company will deliver your packages, because if i could i would never order anything being delivered by Canada Post. joke of a company. upon talking to amazons customer service i was told the package was lost in transit. so the story about my address being undelivered was completely false. Unreal theres over 5000 negative reviews and experiences about Canada Post and there is still no change in how they operate. someone that works there should take the hint. There is no reason why this DELIVERY company makes DELIVERING packages a god damn nightmare."
"I had 3 packages sent From Calgary AB to Fort St John BC.... premium paid for xpresspost. After 6 buisness days ( 8 total days) & several phone calls, emails, tickets created & monitot assigned etc my packages were able to be put in wrong vehicle!!!!! A.package in MY CITY will now be 3.MORE DAYS AT THE EARLIEST!!!! PAID FOR GUARANTEED 2 DAY DELIVERY!!!! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ON ALL FRONTS!!! GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DO AS GOVERNMENT DOES OBVIOUSLY!!!!"
"Delivery driver buzzed once, I couldn't answer the buzzer in time since she went back to her truck after probably waiting almost a minute, so i went down to talk to her, and to grab the package. She was very rude as she was coming out with a delivery note, like i've inconvenienced her, just because she had to walk a few steps back to her truck to get the package."
I usually always put my home address cause every shipping company deliver to my home but not post Canada and they don‚Äôt let me change it to my P.O. Box .. very bad service and they will always delayed your package for no good reason
"Canada Post initially told me my parcel would be delivered Dec 2nd, it‚Äôs now Dec 9th with no sign of my parcel.
Extremely disappointed as this is a birthday gift for a very good friend.
Links provided in emails have proved to be useless, the Autobot is worse than useless. This is not my first experience with terrible service from this company. Why are tax payers funds keeping this useless company afloat."
Why they leave u a delivery notice without ringing your bell before? I was home waiting for the package but now I have to go get it tomorrow? That really sucks man!!
If I could give 0 stars I would. They won‚Äôt even deliver your package if you live in an apartment building (they are not required to ring your bell due to high touch surfaces) and they never leave a delivery notice. The chat does nothing for you other than giving you your tracking number. I will never pay for this service again.
What is reason for giving expected delivery day then take millions days for delay? My package always takes months to delivered even when I pay for priority. This service is really a scam.
"The racking system makes no sense. The package left my city to go further away to a bigger city, now its been there for a WEEK without showing any delivery attempts. What gives??"
"If I could give 0 starts I would. Horrible delivery. Inefficient support agents/system. You wait a long time to talk with them and they basically give you nothing more than what you see on the tracking. Have not been able to know delivery dates until the day the package is out for delivery, which absolutely makes no sense. Need to wait days for expedited shipments which is unacceptable. Their answer has always been ‚Äúhigh volume‚Äù."
From qc city..My parcel arrived and received by poste canada montreal on 27 nov that i should get it by 31..today is 6 dec but i never got my product ..still waiting ..its the service too slow and troublesome..
"Terrible customer service.
Their tracking system is a joke.
People should stop using Canada Post!"
I live an hour and a half away from Saint Johns Newfoundland and my package has been in St. John‚Äôs now for five days‚Ä¶ They are the slowest company I‚Äôve ever seen ship anything! A turtle can deliver quicker on it‚Äôs back
Dogsh*t company. Xpresspost? 1-3 delivery guarantee? More like scan at the depot and then sit there for weeks without update.
"Package has been sitting in Ottawa since Nov 29th. It‚Äôs Dec 6 today!!! I only live 20 minutes away!! What is wrong with this company?!! even the CS reps are useless. After hearing about that Canada post employee stealing 500 packages, I‚Äôm worried if mine were stolen!!"
paid for express shipping on something I ordered mid November its been sitting in Vancouver since nov 30th what a joke I hope theses clowns go out of bussiness
"Ordered from Mountain Hardwear and ended up with this crappy delivery service delivering my items to a wrong address (not even the same city). Customer service was rude saying ""if"" the order is returned by this wrong addressee back to them (its an expensive on-sale item so I strongly doubt it gets returned), they will send it back to the sender who has to ship it again to me using this crappy service again. The question left unanswered is how can they even deliver it to someone not in the same zipcode, city, street or apt? UPDATE: Surprise, it was delivered to me the next day! In the end, rude agents and improper tracking gets only an extra star."
Use any other shipping company. I'm still waiting for something that was supposed to be here last Friday. I paid for 1 day shipping so I could have my parcel for the weekend. I should have just drove the 3hrs to get it. Never have a problem from other companies
My order was delivered very fast & emailed me updates throughout the delivery process. When delivered they knocked on my door and left my package in a safe spot.
"Used mail forwarding because I moved from Ontario to Alberta. For the three months I paid for, they sent the wrong mail to my new address, while continuing to send our mail to the previous address. Numerous escalations and discussions with supervisors and the depot failed to fix the issue. I was promised a follow up phone call to provide me a discount and they have failed to follow through.

Furthermore, I was offered the use of their shipping service through another person's business account. I was charged and continued to be charged on my credit card with no explanations as to the charges. I had to change my credit card and am now disputing these charges. I have since discovered that the business account is used for illegal purposes, shipping fake designer merchandise from China to Winnipeg and Toronto, and when I told Canada Post this, they had no interest in investigating the matter. All in all Canada Post is nothing but a disaster, confirmed by the over 5,000 one star reviews on here."
"Whenever i buy an item online i pray it doesnt get shipped my Canada post. Theyre very consistent at being as inconsistant as possible. Ill track an item and it will arrive in my city but then sit for 2 months in some warehouse? (or they just lost it and are trying to make it look like something is getting done. whenever i ask the useless people over the phone where my stuff is they ""make a ticket"" and ""have best regards"" which does nothing, nothing gets done, nothing will happen, you wont get your mail and nobody will care :D
Canada post honestly just feels like a casino, you invest your money into them and hope that youll get something. The shortest amount of time ive had to wait for a package to arrive was 3 months... from a neighbouring provence?? i could take the trek over there and get it before canada post puts it in their shiny new, expensive vans haha.
Absolutely useless, a joke of a company, the only reason theyre still functioning is because they leech off Purolator's funds."
"I sent a small card (5 x 7) to my mother with a single flat chocolate in it (see picture beside my name). The card came back with the notification that one stamp was not enough. Really??? I went to the post office to ask if it was a joke. Nope. I had to pay another 1.15$ to send the chocolate. Almost 2$ for a single piece of flat chocolate. Doesn't matter how they measure or weigh it, it doesn't make sense."
"Worse postal ever , Lost 80% of packages and i have to responding on refund to customers , Waste products cost shipping cost for nothing till we have to stop shipping to Canada , I wonder why the bug country have to super suck postal like this ?"
"This guys should be out of business, awful, not on time service, not relaible, not honest.
2 days delay, and in the end instead of delivery they offer me to pick up in office tomorrow. Driver claimed that he cant deliver ( I'm at home waiting )
Parcell will go back to seller, every business should know that Canada post bad choice.
Too bad I cant mark -10"
Expedited delivery that has not been fullfiled 7 days later. Truly outstanding service. You do not have to be in this line of business when you are this incapable.
"How can ups, purolator, fedex, and amazon, deliver just about any product you can think of in about 3 days or less, without incident, and it takes Canada post on average of 8-10 days? That is if they don‚Äôt deliver it to the wrong address!! If a company uses Canada post as the only option for shipping, I will look for the product somewhere else."
If I could give zero stars I would. I have had 3 different delivery dates so far no package. Impossible to talk to a human and vitual assistant is a joke. So it is apparently an 8 day trip and counting from mississauga to london. Absolutely pathetic service
"Absolutely ridiculous!! I paid over $100.00 to have a car part (that was worth less than the cost of shipping) sent to my son using ""Priority guaranteed 2 business days"" shipping. I sent it on Tuesday so he would have it by the weekend when he's off work and can fix the car. As of today (Friday), your customer service personnel have no idea where my parcel is but they ""assume it's in transit"" and should be there by Monday!!??! That's 6 days later!!! Unbelievable!!! Very disappointing as it was imperative that it got there by the weekend!!"
"I've had multiple packages this week in the next city over sit for a full week, just 3 hours drive away with the tracking updating to ""delayed due to severe weather conditions"" when it's been clear days and sun. Happens all the time but this season is the worst I've ever seen. Currently waiting on a package the was due Wednesday, it's now Friday, it's been in that next city over since Tuesday, no excuse to not have been here on time Wednesday, until surprise surprise, updated today with ""severe weather conditions"" on a sunny and plus 2 day with the new delivery date moved to Monday, 5 days late, I can walk to the city and back in that time where they claim it's sitting in ""severe weather conditions""."
"Horrible shipping company, never early, almost always late and never deliver to my house its always the post office unlike EVERY OTHER SHIPPING COMANY. And when i lived in a town where they did deliver to my house they would either knock and DASH back to the car so they don't have to work or just not show up and say they did. HORRIBLE company and i wish anytime i order something online i could pay extra to not have it shipped by Canada Post."
"I legit was waiting at the door for an expected package... I was right there at the time just a matter of chance to see the maillady of my area fail to knock on my door go straight to a community mailbox. Start loading the package into there.. I don't have the key til my landlady gets home. So I ran over showed my ID and asked if I could receive my package... This person says AND I QUOTE "" DOESNT WORK THAT WAY""...... LOL its my mail.. your sitting on your phone here... And you don't want to do your job properly in anyway shape or form"
"So my husband is in town working at nova chemicals and so he is staying at a hotel. He rented a PO Box at the Blackfalls Post Office for the past two weeks. I‚Äôve been going there every other day picking up parcels today I go in there to pick up safety equipment for my husband for his job And they refuse to give me the parcel. I told them my husband works until 6 o‚Äôclock in the evening Monday to Saturday. You guys are open when he is off work and it‚Äôs safety gear for his job. This is time sensitive time sensitive. He needs this personal and she said no well he‚Äôs gonna have to come in and he‚Äôs gonna have to fill out a form. I said well and he has to come in and we want to see him sinus and I still can. I record him holding his ID, and then filling the paperwork out and then show it to you that way she says no I want him in front of me to sign in front of me so I can see it marked for myself , I said OK fair enough then I said but in the past two weeks I have picked up four parcels. Can I see your manager the manager comes out I said oh you‚Äôre the one who gave me my personal two days ago, and this lady here gave it to me five days ago and the other lady that stayed in there gave it to me six days ago so the blonde manager decided not to do her job that in the last week and the brown new white haired, new one decided not to do her job throughout the last week and the other brown hair girl Behind the desk decided not to do her job all week and today since the three of them are there together they must not want to look bad. They decide to do their job, but I can‚Äôt pick up a safety gear for my husband that he needs for his job because they want to be horrible witches Get a life ladies he‚Äôs watched me take the tag out of the PO Box which I have a key for I gave you my ID I had my husband‚Äòs ID to show you and that still wasn‚Äôt good enough. I even offered to take a video of him filling out the paperwork that wasn‚Äôt good enough. Missy wants to flex her tits and feel special for a day And wants him to sign in front of her but she didn‚Äôt look so powerful when I said in front of the entire store which had about a half a dozen people in there that they all have given me parcels in the past week and it‚Äôs really unfortunate that today when I need the safety equipment, they decide to do their job that they didn‚Äôt do for the past week and a half When I was just picking up underwear and stupid stuff like that so now my husband has missed time from work to come in and sign his name in front of this lady and put me on the PO Box so she can feel special if not, she said he can wait until next week who are you to say that my husband can wait until next week for his safety gear when he works at extreme heights, not behind a desk standing there there looking each other like making everybody that comes in their miserable just to be around you. not behind a desk stay in there looking each other like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to help them you help them. No I don‚Äôt want to help them you help them. No I don‚Äôt want to help them you help them. Like is a gaul of us to expect you to help customers that come in to a place to be served by the customer service lady at the desk, The three morons couldn‚Äôt figure it out between them.‚Äù making everybody that comes in. There miserable just to be around you. If you‚Äôre going to do your job right do it right all the time not just when you feel like it if it‚Äôs OK three other days it should‚Äôve been OK today, considering I had my ID his ID a picture of the two of us together, multiple pictures of the two of us together because he‚Äôs my husband, and even that wasn‚Äôt good enough even a video of him filling the paperwork out showing his ID wasn‚Äôt good enough. She wants to feel special well I hope you don‚Äôt walk out as slip on the stairs and break your neck and on the way to ladies, I‚Äôd hate to see somebody get hurt in a safety situation with icy stairs"
"Always saying received after cut off yet the package is dropped off by 10am, they say it should take 4 days to get it to the destination yet it is going on 9 days and has been sitting in Edmonton for 2 days yet I live in Calgary and the package came from Ontario. No help from customer service basically tell you its on the way"
"Canada post is so unreliable and they make claims that they do not hold up to. They claim delivery dates that are sometimes way off. People pay extra for such services as Express post, but when they start adding extra days on ur expected date of delivery, who's held responsible. If you pay for a service that they claim to provide, and they dont hold up their end, the customer should be reimbursed the whole entire shipping fee. Time for canada post to start taking accountability for their service."
"Fast shipping always, very reliable. I live in a semi-remote location and always am able to get my package. Never had a package not delivered"
I paid a premium price for next day delivery and it has been 4 days now and it still has NOT been deliverd!! f...kyou I will NEVER use canada post ever again!!!!!
Really bad service.this service shame for canada.what we send will return to you so I think better to send through other ssrvices
It‚Äôs still a month before Christmas. I ordered a gift from Quebec. That‚Äôs a 9 hour drive from my house. 7 days later it‚Äôs still not delivered. According to the tracking it‚Äôs been in the processing centre here in the city for 3 days. Why‚Äôs it not delivered yet. Anyone I tell this to simply says that‚Äôs CP for you. It‚Äôs a shame that CP accepts such a low bar of service and that is now their standard
Worst service ever Shame on the employees who are working there shame on you guys shame on yoy
"I only gave 1 star because there was no option for 0! I ordered a small tool from the US, it took 2 days for USPS to get it across the US to Ontario. It has been in Canada Post possession for over three weeks and has been as close to my Saskatchewan location as Winnipeg before turning up now in Quebec. Honestly as a Canadian I would never use Canada Post because of the inefficient, entitled, uncaring staff and management. There‚Äôs not a worse delivery system in the world."
For what Canada have ‚ÄúCanada post‚Äù just for created work places to take taxes from employees and from the other side collect money from costumers. Two packages they lost and tried pretending they delivered. Shame on you! Canada where your service???? And where my two packages???
"Once again Canada Post fails to deliver an item... surprise surprise. Two items orders at the same time from Amazon, both arrived in the city at the same time. One went to Bonshaw and was at my door within 2 hours of being marked out for delivery, the other went to Canada Post, was marked out for delivery... and is now lost, no answers provided by customer service and the expected date on my delivery from them has been changed to some time between Nov 25th and Dec 5th. In other words, they lost the FIFTH items in a row they've tried to deliver to me and once again are giving me the run around before in a week or so time when I get a notification that it's been returned to sender. Happens every, god, damn, time. When will Canada Post be shut down for absolutely failing to provide even the most basic aspects of their service? Cause it's far beyond time for it to happen."
Extremely slow and I am unable to track my order witch I purchased nearly two months ago. On an older package it stated that someone signed to receive my order but I did not and I never even saw my order until I was forced to pick it up from the post office physically.
"EE218850768CA was charged $89 for speed post to Dublin, Ireland and the delivery is still 'STANDARD' and the package won't arrive before December 2nd, despite sending via SPEEDPOST on Nov 16, 2022. AND THE CROOKS FROM IRELAND POSTAL SERVICE CHARGE ANOTHER ‚Ç¨16 WITH NO SIGN OF DELIVERY AS YET. WHAT A SCAM AND SHAM!CANADA IS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH DEVELOPED CROOKS FROM CANADA POST TO GOVERNMENT ONLY ROBBING OFF PEOPLE'S HARD EARNED TAX MONEY AND GIVE ZERO 'BACK' IN SERVICE OR PRODUCTS.
EVERYONE HERE PLEASE NOTE ""NEVER USE SPEED POST."" IT'S A SCAM!!! AND SHAME ON YOU CANADA POST."
"If there is a 0 star review I would've picked that ! Horrible experience I shipped my docs to get a visa from a travel agency and they lost my shipment which has sensitive docs including passport, birth certificate and other docs. They opened an investigation and never got back to me. I had my wedding aligned, flight tickets, booked a venue and other bookings, and all of that was delayed because of this incident. Eventually, the travel agency reached out to me that they delivered the shipment to the wrong address and it was found after more than a month in a close location ! I opened a claim ticket and I wasn't taken seriously by any means.
NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH CANADA POST !"
Poor delivery! I‚Äôll tell the company I ordered item use other delivering company but not this ‚Ä¶
"I would give them a 0 if I could. Terrible updates, terrible service. They tell you you will get your delivery and next day it won‚Äôt arrive for 2 weeks. No updates on delivery schedule. Next time I order from Amazon if delivery is by Canada Post I won‚Äôt buy."
"Sent 3 boxes from Canada to Scotland uk.
They were in Montreal for over a month!!! Then I kept being told they were sent but they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything else. 3 months later they send me an email asking for receipts of what‚Äôs in the boxes. Who keeps receipts for over 3 months?
Canada post has the worst service and I believe they have stolen the boxes. How do they just disappear???
It cost me 400.00 to ship these and there was at least 1000.00 worth of goods in the boxes.
I‚Äôm truly disgusted. Next time I‚Äôll pay extra for FedEx or a reputable company. Canada post has even lost letters that were sent to close by addresses.
DO NOT USE CANADA POST"
Had a parcel that was suppose to be delivered November 15 2022 still waiting for item.dont know why item seems lost for 7 days just seem to get the runaround now they say I have to wait another week or so for more follow up why do I have to wait when it says it's been in transit for 8 days now really not happy with this service considering on November 15 2022 it indicated item was suppose to be delivered by the end of the day November 15 2022
"Sent a
I sent a letter from the UK and put Etobicoke instead of Rexdale on address I did have the right post code so it really should have been delivered, I thought that was the purpose of post codes.

"What a scam!!!

Paid extra for ‚Äúguaranteed two day delivery‚Äù. Package scanned on Tuesday with ETA for late Thursday. End of day Thursday check status on web app because package didn‚Äôt arrive. New ETA Monday???? What happened to Friday or Saturday? I call to inquire in the hope they can expedite and all I get is what they read on the system. No reason why it‚Äôs delayed, but yet the system knew to change the delivery date. So what is the point of xpresspost and the higher charge?

Dec 3rd- still have not received package. After 10 days of chasing information with CP supervisors, a new scan located the package at a Scarborough facility. More calls with supervisors and all they can do is ask that I wait for it to be processed which can take up to 3 weeks. Weeks not days. This was supposed to be a 2 day delivery."
"From the UK to Alberta. Well,4 weeks latter and still not package. A 9 hrs flight and they can't manage in 4 weeks. Must be the worst postal company in the world. They regularly lose my packages. And we have to rely on this incompetent awful service."
"If I can give it 0 star I would. Their service is so bad. They didn‚Äôt even try to deliver my package. Instead of letting me know that they have arrived at the building they just made no effort to reach me and said that they couldn‚Äôt deliver it. The notice they left said that it will be ready next day after 1pm at the post office but I went the next day after 3 and nothing. Then I received another notification said that it is ready at 8:30pm and I went to get it. It was still not there! Imagine how many trips back and forth that I had to make. It is so annoying, I wish they would run out of business soon."
"Canada Post is useless. Xpresspost is not express. Horrible experience. No help.
Use Purolator. Chat room is useless."
"If the mailman can't deliver our package with care, it's time to privatize mail delivery service to raise the standards. My doorbell catches video of the mailman basically throw the package to my door without any regards and rang the doorbell."
I live in an apartment building and Canada Post has always left packages in the lobby. I've told them more than once to stop doing that. I've spoken to lawyers and even a manager. You might as well talk to a wall at this point. They seemed to have gotten the hint when I threatened to sue.
"Paid for expedited (lol) service for a gift 2 hours away. The delivery standard date has long passed and all I see is ‚Äúelectronic label created‚Äù. The package hasn‚Äôt even been picked up by Canada post yet.

Reason for expected delivery date change: Canada post received package after cutoff time. However no acknowledgment of the package in their system because it‚Äôs still sitting at the seller‚Äôs business."
The dumbest company ever couldn‚Äôt even change my address properly. They finally returned our money after months of incompetence. This company is the worst
"worst service ever!!! you pay hundreds of euros for express shipping to Germany. (2-6 days until delivery at my place)
My package has been in transit since 25/10.
Thanks for the express delivery üò°üò°üò°
this company should be closed forever."
"Opened my package.


My parents send me box with brand new clothes. Those not clever people opened box."
I don't understand why it costs the most to ship with Canada Post and it takes the most amount of time to deliver...I have been waiting 3 weeks to recieve item....this unheard of with any other courrier service.
"Was given a delivery time,due to porch pirates I rely and expect an item to have accurate tracking.delivery was not made on day or time given.
Wasted my time.
Maybe canada post can start paying for my inconveniences they create."
I wish there were zero stars. Canadapost doesn't deserve even one star. The worst service in the world.
Xpress post! What a joke. It‚Äôs just a money grab. The letter was to be delivered in 2 business days. One week later still had not been delivered. Didn‚Äôt even leave the originating city for 4 days. Service??? There is none!! Super inefficient!!!!!
They leave delivery notice and don't bother knocking or ringing. You have one job! Deliver!!!!!!!
I know a digital offer that expired by a couple of days and wouldnt do anything to help me out. They won't be getting my business moving forward!
"I really don't know how they hire the employee and train their staff. Always mess up the address, and if we're lucky, the neighbor will bring it to you. Recently, for any package they won't leave at the door, they just put a notice card without ringing the bell. They can just be that lazy to drop off the packages! Isn't that your job duty? Or you don't get pay for that? Oh, and we have to pay for your mistakes! How many people complaint that never get a notice card? And parcel got returned. We have to pay for the shipping again. Why can't you train your staff how to do their job instead of strike once a year to complaint your wage is too low. You don't even do your job!"
"Customer service is extremely slow. The individual took nearly five + minutes for each transaction. A four person line will take up to half an hour for service.
Service rep:"
"These people are so slow, it takes ages to get something delivered to you, they keep changing the estimated delivery date as they like. Totally Horrible , they deserve a 0 star."
"Canada post london 951 highbury,for your kind notice, this is not to complain about any one telling my feelings.
Back end loding and unloading 80% of staff are not behaving with drivers specially contract drivers and in that brown drives behave like those drivers are slaves if we ask about delay or other they make more delay they all know we get pay as per contract not by hourly it means even if we drive for 5 hours will be getting pay for 3 hours and 50 minutes which is very unfare and I hope this timings had set on 2019 3 years passed, traffic and mail had been increased instead of 1 mono there is 4 so this things should reconsider and about the staffs who loaded for drivers"
"I put one star but would have preferred to give none.
I received an e mail saying a parcel I had been sent from Canada had gone back to warehouse, and I should click on blue letters to re arrange delivery.When I clicked on it came up ""Error - 404 not found.WHERE IS MY PARCEL? HOW DO I RE ARRANGE IT? WHY WAS NO NOTE PUSHED THROUGH MY DOOR WITH INFORMATION.CANADA POST DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP THE GOODS I WAS SENT FROM CANADA."
"Every single time a letter gets mailed to me, it either gets lost, or takes WEEKS to show up... this has been happening for a very long time, before covid, etc...

Not during holidays or their strikes either."
"They changed community mailbox without notice and I have no access to my mails (keys been replaced)... I check my mails once a week yes, but still no excuses for taking over my mailbox as now I may really miss many things because it takes time to resolve the issue...
Can't not to mentioned they lost my passport 8 years ego somewhere on the way from Ottawa to Edmonton somewhere on the way and the amount of wrong addresses mails I found in my box over the years..."
We made payment for home delivery only to get called to receive by the post office
TOTAL RIP OFF TO SHIP WITH CANADA POST. I shipped a package today and it cost me $22 to ship to a city 3 hours drive away! What a joke with the rip off gas charge added! WOW use other carriers for better and cheaper service! Total rip off with the price to ship a package a few hours away!
Absolutely horrendous service. Tracking is completely inaccurate and constantly changed. Corrupt and insincere company. Wastes everyone‚Äôs time but doesn‚Äôt fuƒçking care because they‚Äôre government regulated!
"1. Got a call from the condo intercom saying you have a parcel from Canada post, please let me in. We let him in and no one reached our apartment. We got a message saying to attempt redelivery, click on this link. It was asking us to pay. So we called Canada post and they said that it was a scam and that they never call anyone and we should never give out personal details on call. It really turned out to be a scam

2. Yesterday morning we got a rude caller saying he was calling from Canada Post and that we should tell him our address since he has our parcel. Now I was expecting a parcel so I asked for more information about him just to make sure this was not a scam. The guy was already rude and then he threatened to send back my parcel if I didn‚Äôt give the address immediately. I asked him again for at least the tracking ID or which post office is he calling from and he disconnected the call.
I immediately contacted their call center and reentered the address and raised a ticket about the threatening caller.
Today morning, the status changed to ‚ÄòReturn to sender‚Äô. I again called Canada post and they said that the package was sent to returns just a few minutes AFTER I had raised the ticket to reconfirm my address. She also said that there is ‚ÄòNothing that she can do about it‚Äô. Instead she said that the caller was ‚Äòkind enough‚Äô to call and ask for the address.

The parcel is still in Toronto, the address was given to the sender‚Äôs post office, was pasted on the box, was reconfirmed with the Canada post customer card and yet it‚Äôs going back due to no fault of ours.

This is ridiculous.

Also, if it was actually a scam call and I had got scammed, even then Canada post would have said that there is ‚ÄòNothing that they can do‚Äô."
"I pay for delivery, and get the excuse the they don't have to deliver to the door. The nearest post office is 20 minutes away by car. The lazy person on delivery don't even attempt to deliver. I'm in a 7 foot wide window watching them drive away. Now I only deal with companies that deal with other than that joke company Canada post"
So damn slow. 10 days to deliver a package 100 miles from where i am
Charged me $400.00 to send a small 7kg box of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. SHAME ON YOU
"It‚Äôs high time you start making your client happy, wasn‚Äôt so pleased with my recent package delivery"
"Dude literally came up with package in hand and dropped the ""we missed you card"" without ever ringing the bell and even tried to be quite with the mailbox. Pathetic as I was home and our doorbell camera caught the entire thing. Now I have to go pick up the thing I paid to have delivered?? Pathetic."
"Very disappointed with my recent experience with Canada post. I sent an express letter on October 17 from Ottawa to Toronto, more than eight (8) days later (today it is 25 October, evening time), the letter is still on the way (not delivered as yet)! A similar mail sent from Constantine-Algeria to Ottawa took no more than five (5) days: Canada post paradoxes!
Very unreliable indeed..."
"0 customer service, sent the form to do pre authorized payment and we were surprised that our account is past due called them again they told me to send another form which we did and today another past due notice because we did not fill out the correct form that's so stupid. We contacted post canada again by email, they send us the correct pre authorized form but we want to pay by credit card so the payment had to be easy right? They said contact canada post to this number, i ve been waiting for one hour and more! No response what a bunch of clowns! You are good to do past due notices but your customer service is 0. Fortunately it was only for 1 invoice!"
"Sick and tired of paying for express and still doesn't come for 5 days , this service is crap , maby working on the weekend would help keep up with orders not to mention stating they can't find my address meanwhile amazon drops it off 3 to 4 times a month with NO PROBLEM."
"Every person I speak with at Canada Post apparently can only write notes in the comments section of their system, but can‚Äôt actually fix problems. Left hand has no idea what the right is doing. If Canada Post was a private company they‚Äôd be bankrupt by now. This carrier is an embarrassment and should be investigated for gross incompetence."
"I often order online. In the last year, Canada Post ""attempted"" delivery more than 20 times. NO NOTICE, nothing. Ever.
Finally, I realized, they NEVER attempt delivery. I think is just hard to park on the street and walk to the door while carrying a package.
Terrible service every single time!"
"The tracking number doesn't exist because the courier neglected to scan the parcel.

This is not my fault or the fault of the company I made my purchase from.

Wake me up, when this scumbag government does something right."
"It I had an option for zero stars, that would be my choice. Similar issues recently as other reviews....delivery agents not attempting delivery, holding onto parcels or carding for pick up at a postal outlet. I've filed 2 to 3 complaints in the last month. Spoke to a supervisor from my depot. He was arrogant and making excuses for why his delivery agent, who he supervises, why she wasn't buzzing my suite or leaving a notice card. I work from home and literally watched her for 2 days deliver me junk assed flyers, meanwhile holding onto my parcel because it wouldn't fit in mail box."
"They don't knock, they just sign a note and have you pick it up yourself. If you can't find delivery people that know/care to knock then just eliminate the middle man and have it delivered to the local postal service centre for pickup. These delivery people should ALL be fired, they don't care about the people they serve. I promise your business model would improve greatly without delivery people. Last time I get stuff delivered by them. Horrible company, they don't give a crap about you and honestly that's why I don't give a crap about them."
Canada post has no integrity or they would actually try to make it to the customer by the delivery date. Everytime you call they have an excuse of why they can't get your package to you even when it's sitting in the local post office. Sincerely disappointed and wouldn't recommend !
It took Canada Post six days to ship an international express parcel from Mississauga to Halifax. What a snail-paced service! Ridiculous!
"What an atrocious experience with terrible shipping! (see pictures) I have always shipped my products to my customers through Canada Post. One time I took advantage of their free shipping as I am a small business customer and for some reason, whoever handled my parcel must have been having the worst day! The products I shipped were squished, broken and some are ripped open, some had leaked despite being packaged securely, it was like they were slammed and tossed around in their truck. It was also delivered to the wrong house but luckily the neighbor delivered it to the right address!
As a small business owner, I trusted your company with my reputation and this is how you treat your customers? I am very upset about this!

Unbelievable! Only an angry delivery person would have damaged the products that I shipped and there‚Äôs no way they would be damaged in transit!

Many of us rely on your service but I just wanna let you know that some aren‚Äôt doing the job properly! This caused me wasted products and most specially customer!"
"If I could rate Canada Post 0 - Stars I would.

I haven't been able to receive a package in a year and a half to my residence. When I call and speak to a supervisor I am given no explanation as to why and am treated so disrespectfully by the highest supervisor available only to be called unprofessional and be hung up on.

Everyone should boycott Canada Post and every single person should lose their job. No accountability and no professionalism by any representative I have spoken to over the last 18 months."
"This company is worth a pile of poo. They lost 2 of my packages, impossible to get a hold of the phone and when the call centre from India picks it up they are clueless. Do not waste your time with this crappy service."
"This must the worsted delivery service in Canada, my package supposed to be delivered by Friday
Oct. 14 according to their tracking
system now the tracking tells me it will be delivered on Tus. Oct.18 , how do you explain that. I live 40 minutes from place they picked my package on October 13, what did they do ,do they walk to deliver parcels, even walking I can make it in one day.why do they have tracking system anyway it's useless.ü§îüëéüëéüëé"
Had a package sent from lethbridge to high river ( about 150km) it ended up in Hinton (approximately 500km north of High River) total incompetent service. DO NOT USE CANADA POST. The government should not be funding this company.
Failed to deliver my package over the last 3 days. I've received two notifications that indicate the package is out for delivery but it still hasn't arrived. Its either antiquated technology or incompetent staff.
"They don't deliver parcels and just leave you a passage notice. Also I was to receive a recommended letter for which I paid 10 bucks, it took 3 weeks to be processed in Canada, received the notice so I actually had to go and pick it up and once I got there, they had ""lost"" the letter. After playing ""ping pong"" on the phone for several days, the letter reappeared by miracle. Prob the worst service ever."
"Absolute garbage, My package has been in their facility for a week, and I don't know which one and no one can tell me this information. Their costumer service is terrible and no one is ever reachable. This is the third time I order stuff and comes with them and I have problems. Also their tracking website is always faulty."
"I would give 0 stars if I could. I paid $24.92 to have a letter tracked to the UK on 09/13/22, on 10/13/22 Canada Post tracking had it still in transit. I called the relevant UK gov. office it was sent to and they had received it on 21/09/22. What is the point of paying for tracking when I ended up having to do it myself. Totally unless!"
"Incompetence, allz I'm sayin'"
"If 0 star is available I would have given that,why don't they deliver packages when they are paid for it. When you call the customer care they make their own stories and never going to resole the issue"
"Why don't they deliver packages as they are expected to and paid for? I work from home and so I am home all day. I was expecting a delivery and they didn't ring the bell or knock on the door, they just left me a delivery notice. Now I have to go pick up the package from the post office. It's ridiculous. What a waste of time.
DO YOUR JOBS, Canada Post employees! It's literally what you're getting paid for."
"How does a crown corporation have the lowest rating on the planet lol? Because they are the most useless and laziest company on the planet! All they ever do is complain about wages, yet they can't even do their job properly!

I ordered a birthday gift for my son and chose express shipping from China. I was able to track it right to my city and it was ""out for delivery"". Then I get a ""Item being returned to sender. Incomplete address."" notification. The seller sent me a copy of the shipping label and everything is clear as day! It even had my phone number on it, so there's no excuse why this LAZY and BLIND Canada Post employee couldn't deliver my package! So these clowns are now returning my sons gift back to China! How does that make any sense?!?! A little effort or even OPEN YOUR EYES and this could've been resolved easily! Now I have to wait for my order to be received back in China, get a refund issued, re-order, and go through the entire process - only to not be able to give my son his birthday gift on time! Canada Post are a bunch of clowns!!!!!"
"Would never ever I would use damn canada post ever again, took 2 days to get from USA to Calgary and to Richmond, been sitting in Richmond for over a month literally less than 10 minutes from my house. F.u. canada post F.U."
"I worked for Canada Post years ago and at that time, the workers were lazy and didn't seem to care about the customers. A week and a half ago, a company sent a parcel to me from Cambridge, Ontario. I live in British Columbia. The parcel went from Cambridge to Stoney Creek and then to Richmond, BC. But then a postal worker sent it to Winnipeg. Why? There is no excuse for this behavior. All you have to know is the first two letters and the number of the postal code and you know where it goes."
It's been 8days for express shipping within Canada. I got my overseas parcel in 5 f*ckin days!!!!!!!
"A insured parcel is not delivered or lost. Trying to contact Canada Post is a nightmare.I want to collect my insurance. Both the chat and tel # are a problem. The Tracking number when you have letters is a problem plus the automated operator comes back because you are not fast enough in entering the #. Normally I use the US Post and will return after a absence because of Covid 19. Canada Post is too expensive, has poor insurance and is overall terrible.

I‚Äôm a Microsoft Network Engineer. Canada Post get you business in order!"
"Absolute piece of s***t. another parcel on hold forever. Took 3 days to arrive to ""facility"" from CHINA!!! and now it has been sitting there for 2 weeks. Absolutely disgusting. Zero service levels and zero accountability. Did I tell you how ""they"" lost my passport via tracked and insured mail a few years ago? How about my legal DOCUMENTS - yes, just a few sheets of very important legal documents that ended up costing me thousands due to their delay. Their HIGHLY INCOMPETENT STAFF SHOULD GO CLEANING PARKS AND DITCHES TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR SKILLS This whole establishment shall go to HELL."
"I wish I could give zero stars but I can't .USPS took only 2 days to get my package from Kentucky to Toronto but my package was sitting is Mississauga for almost 7 days , when it was finally ""delivered "" I have to walk 5 km to a post office to pick it up instead of grabbing it off the community mail box ."
"2nd time that they've lost a package that they claim to have delivered. I'm lucky it's ""only"" $50 worth of stuff this time - last time, they lost a package with a bunch of passports in it, my birth certificate, etc.

They can't be bothered to check who was supposed to deliver my package, and refuse to open an investigation into this."
Had a package mailed xpress post supposed to be 2 days .mailed on Sept 28th Oct 5 still waiting on it. Tracking says it's still in transit. Next time I will use fed ex better price and service I can count on CANADA POST IS A JOKE AND WASTE OF TAX DOLLARS.
"I would give you -5 stars if I could, shipping cost with no tracking cost $31 with tracking $75 so I am paying fn robot computer electronic tracking $44 plus extra charge $12 for fuel cost for your car !!!!!???? What a robbery ü§¨ HUH"
"Happened thrice and never received my package. There is a mailbox in the residence to drop off the package. The agents mark the package as delivered and it is never there. They will charge you for re-delivery. This postal service should not exist, shut this business. Untrained employees you guys dont care for your customers 'TIME AND MONEY'. WHAT A WASTE...!!!!"
"expresspost should get sued for misrepresentation, everything they promise is forgotten once the fee is paid. Mail used to be the one service that was reliable no matter what, you would think with all the competition Canada Post would be in the top position backed by their long standing presence representing Canadians but just like Justin Trudeau do more work with their mouth than with their hands and just like Justin Trudeau have no patriotic pride, if you mention some of the problems with Canada Post their employees shrug their shoulders and let you know they really don't give a damn and never will yet are well paid. The only way to clean up Canada post is either sell it to another interested delivery company or fire everyone there and start over again since the staff presently has been spoiled rotten and beyond repair. If the Prime Minister doesn't give a damn why should the ones under him, they justify this by thinking if Justin doesn't care why should those making much less care, in the meantime the Canadians are paying good money for a service that doesn't care about them, time to drain the swamp starting with lazy Justin Trudeau and anyone else who use his example."
1 to 3 day express post and yet I have not received my passport . I have a flight booked to Africa and my parcel is not here as stated. I'm totally disappointed with the service Canada post has to offer. 5 time I was told things about my express post. The tracking system doesn't show where my package is .
"Lake cowichan Canada post is the most pathetic excuse for a government office known to man. 2.5 years after covid began, they are the only nymrods who still open an hour later and close an hour earlier. Imagine if the rest of the businesses were this pathetic 2.5 years later!!!?? Nothing like paying for a lazy employees wages! What a joke!"
"Really sad that amazon can get a package from china delivered with standered delivery to you faster then canada post can deleiver a package from 2 hrs away with 1 day shipping... i ordered a package that from where its coming from to where its going is just under 2 hrs away. I paid for the 1 day deleivery. And im expected to get the package in 5 days. Is this not false advertising? Getting people to pay for a faster delivery for them to fail on that delivery by 4 days ? Even when the item is parishable. I. It seems like canada post is the biggest failures in life. They cry for more money, but cant even deliver items on time. They go on strike ruin every other persons life with late mail that can be extreamly important... not gonna lie i would support amazon if they happened to open up a new devision for mail to replace canada post. I mean you will never have late mail im sure some of the mail you get will be days early also. All employees at canada post should be ashamed of them selfs for the absolute horrendous job they do. Clean house should happen give other people the job that are willing to do the job right."
"Lazy incompetent and outright fraudulent Postal Worker. (*PW)

So, I had a package/box (38 lbs. approx) ordered from Alberta.
Arrival date was accurate. Time was late.
Postal Truck arrives, driver wearing mask inside the truck, lol, pulls up, crossparks at the end of driveway and sits for 5 minutes. (All documented on CVCC)
PW (female) exits the PW truck, runs down driveway carrying a piece of paper in hand.
Approches my door; bends down and slips the paper into mail slot, stands up, turns and starts to run back.
I open the door before she gets away.
Me: ""Hey, what did you put in my mail slot?""
P W: ""A delivery slip.""
Me: ""Why?""
PW : ""I didn't think you were home.""
Me: ""Here's an idea. Try knocking on my door first, so where's my package?""
PW: ""In the truck.""
Me: "" So lemme get this st8ght, You are paid with taxpayer's monies to drive around with my package, come to my place, park your truck for 5 minutes while filling out a delivery slip, precluding no intention of knocking on my door to see if anyone is home to do your job delivering my package . . . . cuz you don't think I'm home? W T F?""
PW bows it's head, returns to truck, comes back with box/package and sets it at my door 10 feet away.
Me; ""I'm disabled so could you move it closer to the door.""
PW; ""I need to keep a safe distance cuz I dont want to be infected.""
Me; ""BWAAA HAAA HAAA HAAA, you're kidding right? We're outside. Anyways, I'm going to complain.""
PW; ""Go right ahead.""
Anyways, this has been a constant practice here for years with these grifting gubermint parasites, to do little or nothing, get thru their job in 3 or 4 hours and get paid for 8 hours.
I know as I used to socialize with a few PW's at a local pub and heard all the scams and shams CP PW stories. Drinking and dope smoking on the job too.
Given the literally 1000's of '1 star bad reviews, it's long past time to drain this parasitic pig trough of incompetents."
"Canada post is the worst delivery service provider that I have ever dealt with. It's delivery personnel do not follow instructions and delivery my items at all. Despite my clear instructions shared with them, they get into my building and leave a delivery notice in my mailbox advising me to pick it up from their office the following day. My packages do not require signature and can easily be delivered to my door or be left in the mail room.

In more than four occasions, they claimed to have attempted to deliver while they did not do anything at all. This Crown corporation has employees who feel so entitled to be paid without actually doing their job. I hope this corporation will go down with all its employees never to recover ever again."
I don't know how they hire their couriers but they obviously get people that don't care about anything or dont receive any training. How hard is it to deliver a package? I don't pay for shipping to have to go pick it up at a store after the fact on my days off. Your job is literally to bring people their packages. DO IT. CanadaPost is an embarrassment.
"""We're sorry.""
About only thing they can truly deliver and you can count on.
With my item being mailed over a month ago. Paying over $100 for such service. Misleading information of delivery date during time of drop off.
Now being told my item is somewhere..???
Hey amazon/ups/fedex... Whats your numbers?
Regardless if higher prices. Refuse to use canada post again unless absolutely necessary.
Id be embarrassed as a countries mail service."
The worst company they dont do their work with pride. My mail got stuck in the mailbox i cant take it out now i gotta wait for the building management to take it out for Me very inconvenient.
"2years waiting on an item just to have it not show up on time 3 days in a row because of routing issues, 4 CP vans have gone by today alone so its not a routing issue, they just don't want to get out the vehicle to drop the item off at anyone's house"
"They‚Äôre useless, paid for priority because I needed my package to be delivered the next business day and is been 3 days now and probably is going to be more by the looks of it."
"they lie about delivery dates. I ordered an item from toronto to vancouver and was suprised to see an estimated delivery date of one day. I was super excited and ansy to receive my $1k+ item, just to find out it didn't come today. all i can say is, hopefully i get it tomorrow. even a 2 day delivery date is still very good, but it is just annoying when they tell you to expect it in one day and then you get your hopes up just to get let down."
"The ‚Äúcourier‚Äù driver will always mark your item as delivered without actually delivering it. When they do deliver, they just shove it in to what ever box is closest hoping you‚Äôll be kind enough to deliver the mail to the correct address. Filing a complaint also never gets investigated. Instead they just tell you there is nothing they can do after asking you to wait a week. You don‚Äôt get you money back, and you never get the item they ‚Äúlost‚Äù. They have no sense of pride in their jobs and just come to work to make pension. Canada Post is by far the laziest, most incompetent, unorganized group ever to exist in Canada. There is nothing worse. Canada Post has set the gold standard for unreliability."
"RIDICULOUS
This is the worst courier company we have. Mishandling items, misplacing items, stealing items. Yet nothing is done with the employees of this company (desperate for employees i guess). People pay for their items and for some reason; Canada post employees think they can keep the items. Delivery time is so long and drivers do not even attempt to deliver the item, they drop it off at the post office for you to go out of your way to pick up. We pay for the shipping to be delivered at home but seems like its self delivery at this point while Canada post takes your hard earned money, yet when you call they tell you ""oh, i'm not sure where the package is, its not with Canada post. Yet the package shows Canada post has it. If only we has an option to choose which courier we can use, that would make its better for everyone. CANADA POST NEEDS TO STOP ITS SERVICES"
"So right we are literally only halfway through September and they have unexplained delays. I was never sent a confirmation email about my package but yes it is trackable thank actual god that the sender gave me the tracking ID because PC TOTALLY dropped the ball. But now it's been sitting in my city for the last 2 days which is fine although there was already a delay. So I check back this morning to see they're putting an extra 2 days of wait time ? For no reason at all ?? Even the customer service bot was confused as to why I didn't get my package yet.
How the Frick are they going to survive through the holidays at this pace.
IMO y'all need to prepare yourselves for the LONGEST most painful mail delays you've ever seen in Canada. I don't see how this is gonna get better.

Oh yeah right also I was waiting for a letter from BEAUPORT which is in my city. The girl on the phone said I had 2 weeks to fill in the paper so until the 30th of August. I RECEIVED THE LETTER THE 28TH AND I HAD TO CALL THE BUREAU IN PANIC BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO GET PENALTIES. under MY name.

This is absolutely not okay."
"The only shipping company that will continually ""lose"" or deliver shipments to the wrong address and never take responsibility for it. I requested 2 investigations over ""delivered"" items they never actually delivered to my address. Nothing, no response at all. Today another of my purchases was marked as ""there was a problem with delivery"" because they ""lost"" the item. High shipping charges for the worst service ever."
Constantly late. Always says it will be here one day and doesn‚Äôt show up for a day or two after. Garbage service
If I could give no stars I would. Im 40 and have been using Canada Post my entire life. I pay for express shipping and my package is always late. They changed my rural mailboxes and didn't notify me or send me a new key for the new mailboxes. The whole Post system needs to be rehauled. The Canada Post system is a joke and costs waaayy too much for the crappy service both in deliveries and customer service. EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WITH CANADA POST
Slowest shipping available. Packages are almost always late.
"Delivered my package to the wrong address completely different number, different street, different postal code. When calling for help was told ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm not sure that there is anything we can do‚Äù. Thanks for losing $500 worth of sentimental items and not even allowing me to file a claim for it. Reps online are useless."
It is plainly obvious that humans do not actually look at addresses a simple mistake caused the shipment to be sent back. Which all other carriers have corrected. It would be proper business ethics to content a customer (like others) to confirm address before shipping back to sender... Holy London incompetence batman!
"Paid full shipping price for an express post delivery item coming from the USA. It arrived as expected at YVR in 3 days. Then it went in limbo, with absolutely no notice/ackowledgement from Canada Post, or from Customs as to where my package was or how much duty to pay for it etc... Yesterday, I spent a lengthy frustrating time ""chatting"" to Canada Post robot Web assistant, repeating 3 times the same USPS tracking number, and the nature of my issue to a very polite machine Suddenly, this morning, that tracking number appeared on Canada Post website, where they Indicated that there are duties to pay, which I immediately paid. To summarize. It is now day 7 since the package arrived in YVR, Vancouver.... And it has yet to be send for delivery by Canada Post to the Sunshine Coast where I live... I paid US $100 for Express Post... !"
I HATE Canada post soooo god damn expensive
Refused to deliver my package when it was already out for delivery
"Absolutely horrible company, look at your reviews and take the hint, it's not your customers it's clearly they way your operating your business. It's time to make HUGE improvements, like HUGE, fire people and hire people that actually understand customer satisfaction."
"I would have given them zero stars if I had the option. I had the worst experience with them. I have an upcoming travel and my passport was mailed to me by Canada post and because of their inadequacy I experienced extensive stress and uncertainty, I was forced to move my flight and to pay extra! A lesson to Never use Canada post and use UPS instead!!!"
"I ordered staff from the Store and gave the seller office Flex delivery address. (PO Box). If somebody does not know about what Flex delivery is: I do not have real mailbox in the post office location, the mail comes to the post office, they will keep it for me for 15 days and I should pick it up myself.
When I came to pick up my parcel, the clerk told me that it was delivered, which means somebody picked it up! They told me that it could be somebody, that has the same address and picked it up. But this is not my case. I live by myself.
So, according to Canada post system, my package was scanned at this location and given to somebody else!
The manager of the store told me that cameras were not working that day, so she does not know who picked up the package. Sure, how convenient. The whole thing looks like a scam to me.
I wonder how many people report something like this to police, but I am going to."
I wish I could rate any less than one star to post this. But I am so frustrated with every delivery not made. They don‚Äôt pay attention to delivery instruction and do not even try to be customer friendly. I do not understand why so many online providers are choosing Canada post as a courier. It is making the whole online shopping experience into a nightmare.
Worst delivery service I've ever used. Not only does it take them AT LEAST a week for something to arrive if its a weekend then your screwed! Don't work weekends nor any holidays plus slow delivery = garbage service. Amazon 2 days tops including weekends! No comparisonüò°üëé
"My package was delayed 5 times over the course of a week. Today is the deadline for receiving it, as I require it immediately - finally out for delivery! Then, with no contact and no indication of delivery, I was given a ""notice of delivery"" and the package was sent to the post office for pickup the next business day (4 days away). I can understand the procedure. What is unacceptable is that I was never alerted to a delivery attempt. Am I supposed to stand outside my apartment from 9 to 4 on the day of my delivery? I even set the delivery settings in case I would not be around, but I was at home! Abolutely disappointing and unacceptable."
"I live in Brampton. Last evening when I collected my post. I found the whole section of the mailbox was open. I got access to all the mail of whomsoever it belongs to and so do any. That shows an acute carelessness and irresponsibility of the mailman. What if some important documents get stolen.
I don‚Äôt mind declare the intersection. It‚Äôs Lorenzo circle-Naperton dr.
Responsibility matters‚Ä¶."
"Once again as usual Canada
Post has no idea what is going on. My package says out for delivery yesterday but I guess the guy decided 5 was quitting time even though it says they deliver till 8 pm. Then it says to be delivered next business day which is today(Friday). Then when I look on the tracking app it says it won‚Äôt be delivered till Tuesday next week. I call and of course they have no idea where my package is or when it will be delivered. Will never use Canada post again. Hopefully you‚Äôll lose all business and have to close and maybe a company who actually knows what the hell they are doing will takeover."
"Wish 0 stars was an option.
Today is September 1, 2022. On August 18th, I had a registered letter sent to me from Langley BC to Kamloops BC. The tracking number shows it left Langley on August 18 to Richmond and this is where it still sits today. I have reached out to Canada Post August 25, 26 and again on 29th. Nothing. They tell me to wait until September 2 for some reason they can‚Äôt explain. On the 29th, one of their supervisors from Ontario said she will call Richmond and get a supervisor there to physically go find my letter (it‚Äôs a nice big check I‚Äôve been waiting for) and she will call me back. This supervisors is named Diane. On the 30th, I called again and the supervisor tells me the Diane is off but she‚Äôll look into it and get back to me. Now I sit here, no calls, no communication, no letter, no update online, nothing at all. I get that mistakes happen, everyone makes them and yes things get lost. The lack of effort in trying to resolve this is insane and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. How frustrating this is is beyond words. So I‚Äôll just wait and see and hopefully I‚Äôll get my check one day. Apparently waiting an hour on hold daily isn‚Äôt getting me anywhere either so I‚Äôll just let them keep filling my mailbox with flyers and junk mail etc cause that‚Äôs about all they don‚Äôt lose. But registered mail they can‚Äôt keep track of. Keep raising your prices and be sure to go on strike soon and demand more money cause your doing such an amazing job there. With supervisors like this, not surprising the system doesn‚Äôt work. Yeah Canada Post, bring this letter to your next staff meeting - and play my recorded conversations as well. I am always polite and never got angry once at any of your staff. Every conversation started with ‚ÄúI am quite upset, but I know it‚Äôs not your fault, I hope you can help me‚Äù. Will never use Canada post again for important documents again, I‚Äôll deal with couriers who actually try to fix things when they make a mistake."
"Bad service I‚Äôm not sure if this person understand English at all but please at least hire someone that does. I wrote a matter that the person can read it but put a note beside it The note I have was please leave the package at the door someone is home
But yet she left a note for me to go pick it up this person really need to understand What is the note mean"
"The absolute worst customer service ever. I ask for an update on my parcel and it turns out its been sitting in one location for over a week now with no indication of it moving. They've labelled it as good for pick up from ""insert city name"". Gee thanks, that really narrows it down. Not only am I now paying for a home delivery they've made no attempts of actually doing but it's not even properly specified where it is. The best bit of it the virtual assistant won't let me file a complaint on the basis that there's no one to physically log it with. Funny how that works isn't it. Now it's either force the sending party to make complaint on my behalf or pay extortionate International call rates to complain about it."
The worst service I‚Äôve ever seen with poor customer service. I wish there was a way to ask brands/ companies not to use Canada post anymore!
"I mailed my documents international on July 14. It hasn't been received by the recipient, so I informed Can post about the problem and they have started an investigation and gave me this ""Service Ticket"". Initially they told me I would hear from them before August 30th. I got an email that they are waiting for the International Post to respond to them back and it would take a month. EXTREMELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!! I trusted that Canada Post would do much better in resolving delivery issues like this ESPECIALLY that my documents are time-sensitive. As usual, consumer are just logistic to them. The person I talked to on the phone today ""said it all"" I felt I just have to wait for another month to know what happen to my documents. Very dismissive and no empathy. I WOULD NEVER TRUST CANADA POST AGAIN!!!!! I f I can score them BIG 0, I would."
"My order has been a two hour ferry trip away for the last four days, still not moving."
"Canada post never made an attempt to deliver my parcel. They slipped a notice into my mailbox with a poorly written identifier, sub elementary school. I went to the new post office miles down the road from the last one and was told to try again tomorrow; after 3."
"We had live caterpillars shipped and unidentified as such by shipper. Friday we had a notice saying that they would be available for pickup Monday.
We called customer service, they contacted the depot, and we were able to pick up our package Friday, and our caterpillars will soon become beautiful butterflies.
Thank you To the agent, supervisor and workers at the depot for getting us our package."
"Canada Post lost my $900 Parcel and told me they would not do a thing about it.. As a small business owner, this extremely impacted my business/sales. Needless to say I will Not be using Canada Post again. The trust has been broken."
"I was supposed to receive a delivery yesterday to my address only it was delivered to the ""wrong"" address which was my old one. I contacted Canada Post to see where the parcel went and was informed that ""they"" only deliver to the address on the shipping label because it's the law. I lost two books! Fortunately, I am getting them replaced but I am not happy about this at all. The customer service agent I spoke with was an idiot and refused to give the information I needed to find where the parcel went. Normally, I find Canada Post good but not this time. I cannot understand why for the life of me you offer a ""deliver to Post Office"" option on your website in the first place. There is no such thing whatsoever! It's a complete waste of my time and effort to talk to these customer service agents."
"Never again canada post ! Twice my packages haven't been delievered and lost. And I used express. I dont trust you anymore now my stuff is out there in the hands of god knows who. Terrible and uncomfortable. I chatted with 3 different people from canadapoat about the matter and they were all useless no one knows what's going on and all I get was a ""sorry for the inconvenience"" did an investigation but no luck there. Super unreliable"
"I haven't received my June invoice yet. I have not received my Ontario Healthy Smile card and they told me they sent it on July 27th.
I sent them a complain. Canada Post Hotline replied that they were unable to investigate the status of the letter. And asked me to contact the sender to re-ship."
"I'm an autistic person living in poverty. I sent my ODSP application by 2-day Xpresspost to get to the ODSP office by a deadline. After 3 days, the envelope didn't even show up in the system. It's like it was never even picked up. Customer service Carol just acted like she couldn't wait to get off of chat and lied just to end the call. When I spoke to Sam the next day, explaining that if the envelope doesn't arrive in time that I will face homelessness, he apologized for the 'inconvenience'. Homelessness is not an inconvenience, Sam! Finally after 4 days. the tracking showed that It was processed. I'll never trust Canada Post with important documents again!"
"Went in to pick up a parcel, older heavy set woman with grey hair was rude & impatient. Kept arguing with me that Amazon tracking was wrong, even after I showed on my phone, I was on the Canada Post website, she was still Rude.

Refused to give me item without ID, which is totally understandable but then I send my husband in to pick up the item & she didn‚Äôt even ask him for any identification, just handed it over to him. The box looks like it has been kicked around the store! Poor Service & I believe you may want to re-educate that women with how to provide better Customer Service as there was no need for her to be that rude."
"I sent a pakage with canada post including my important documents ,my passport , my ID ,... but when it was delivered it was reported to me that my passport and ID WERE MISSING , I had an important travel which i cannot go now they ruined my life . never trust canada post."
Such a poor service am waiting for my courier from last 4 months and still I don‚Äôt know where is my courier. Not suggest at all just waste of time and money. Even workers don‚Äôt know that how long my courier will take time.
"Two packages value over 100$ both were ‚Äúin transit‚Äù from Ottawa on Aug 21st ( I live 20 minutes away from Ottawa) have not been updated in 3 days, delivery delay. This has happened way too many times!!!! This is ridiculous!! Everything is way too expensive for things to go ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. Canada post employees already get paid a lot, but some bad apples continue to take packages for themselves!!! There needs to be more law enforcement on them."
"The worst experience i have ever had
Never use their service, my parcel never reached india its been 3 months already and if you call the customer service they say we can not do anything , i really do not understand why they even have a customer service phone number if they do not want to resolve the issue

I sent it without tracking because it was my first time and i never knew that if i send a non trackable package , its never gonna reach there , they said its gonna reach in 15-20 days if you send it without tracking id and i believed and that was my biggest mistake

I would suggest just remove that service please, because if u guys do not want to send it and dont even want to answer that where that parcel is then why should have a service like that
Just go with one service tracakable post only"
"Online it says you are open on Sundays. Upon entering it says all of August you are closed on Sundays. Thanks for wasting my time! Change your online information for crying out loud. Have some respect for your customers!
Also, if you‚Äôre refusing to send out parcels 30 minutes before closing time this is information that should be made available online as well. CP is seriously so unreliable frustrating.

I‚Äòm wondering if CP actually reads all these horrendous reviews?? I guess they just don‚Äôt give a sh-t as services seem to be getting worse and worse."
"Good Day dear Customer!

My apologies for disturbing you but it is real. Canada Post service is Marvellous for having a nightmare or torture sensations if you are interesting.
A document letter between London ON and Australia so far one month one week and counting.

I ordered the document from another country and I fixed my problem.

The Important point was the Canada post worker confirmed that is going to spend two weeks.üåö"
"The Tracking service is not working and the prices are unreasonable. Especially for the miserable performance. A 2 Kilo package that I had send from Canada to Germany cost me the same as a 4+ kg package that I had mailed from Germany to Canada. DOUBLE! Also, the recent parcel mailed from Germany made it out of the Country with DHL within 3 days and the tracking worked great. Since then, it had been 2 weeks and no tracking or information available, I understand that there are disruptions everywhere and the delivery can take time, but I would appreciate to be able to track the parcel, but since leaving DE .... CRICKETS!"
Why does Canada Post take over a week to drive an item from Ottawa to Calgary ???? All the time. 7 business days !!!!!! This is Unbelievable . We're paying good money for your services . Bring your rates down to correspond with the service your providing .
One of the worst service provider never deliver anything on time will never use canada post service any business use canada post to we will never buy anything from them.
There is a man by the name of Chris Carr who is working for Canada Post. His brother is a murderer named Darren Dixon Carr who works for the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) Chris who was my brother in law called me bat sh_t crazy when I let him and the rest of the family know the truth. He should not be in a position of handling legal mail within a corporation like Canada Post whilst him knowing what his brother has done. Darren embezzled over a million dollars using Canada post as a service to launder my money I earned that he stole after a 19 year marriage.
"Online stamp purchase was ‚Äúcancelled due to technical difficulties‚Äù. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever used the online store for Canada Post. No explanation given by service rep regarding the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù problem. The rep inferred that this was a common complaint.
If this was a private business, they would go bankrupt! Canada Post should presumably have access to the best IT people. Maybe not. I‚Äôm not impressed :("
"Went to where i usually go, computers are down AGAIN. Been down a handful of times in the last couple months. So I go to the main plant, closed due to staff shortage. And they continue to increase their rates for this awful service. I have a small business and mail orders daily. Sure wish there was another option, I'd jump ship in a second."
They literally never even try to deliver packages. Just leave a card for pickup in mailboxes. Those are even late arrivals half the time saying item on hood at customer request??? I have never asked them to hold and not deliver a package in my life. Brutal brutal service.
"HORRIBLE!!! I would have given zero star if I could but it does not allow. By far the most lazy, irresponsible and useless employees ever.
The mail man is lazy to bring in the package, more than four supervisors on the opened ticket‚Ä¶.problem hasn‚Äôt been solved after two weeks and no-one takes responsibilities for the matter. Pathetic excuse for a company representing a country‚Äôs postal service."
"I had to send a document to the UK from Canada.
My UK pension had been cut off until I sent some ID info to them by mail.
So I went to Canada Post, asked for registered mail and asked the guy at the counter if I would get notification when it was delivered and he said yes.
This service cost is $20. I hadn't used this service before so I believed what he said. Turns out that you only get notification when it is sent to a Canada address. I just paid CP to confirm that my envelope had been sent. Basically they charged me $20 to prove that they had done their job and shipped it from Canada. Shame on you CP, you just ripped off a pensioner for $20
Next time I'll use a courier."
"Ordered a package and was told it would be here in 3-5 business days, it‚Äôs now been 3 months and my package is on the other side of the country ‚Äúlost‚Äù. It was shipped from north Alberta and was supposed to go to south Alberta, yet it ended up in Toronto. Absolutely horrible shipping service and even worse customer support."
"Even before they look at a package you get a notice saying ""delivery delayed due to external factors"". REALLY? You haven't even picked up or seen the package yet! 14 Days from Mississauga to New Brunswick, what total BS."
"We are stuck with the awful Community Mailbox,and everytime we get a parcel delivered there,the key doesn't work and I am stuck waiting even longer. This had happened 14 times in the last year. Jesus,please fix something for once."
"This is totally unprofessional and unacceptable.

Their tracking system said
My package was delivered the said they left a card detailing where I can pick my package up.

I received no package and no card and true system does not tell me where to pick it up.

Canada post is absolutely the worst. I asked them to call me and have heard nothing."
"Canada post won't even deliver packages to our house unlike all other delivery services. They send an email claiming they tried, but they just deliver straight to the post office. Brutal."
"THEY SUCK. I have an order ready to be picked up August 9th after 1pm - I went there at 1pm and they said they havent sorted out the deliveries yet, so i went back the next day and I picked it up Aug 10 at 2pm. They said ‚ÄúIm not sure if its here because we havent sorted it yet.‚Äù, I was there for two days straight!!! and guess what, i need to go back again tomorrow. HORRIBLE!!"
There is no option for no stars so had to give one star. Tried to forward my mail online. They took my money then never finished the transaction told me I could wait 14 days to get my money and and to try it again I can see why no one wants to use canada post
Canada post is too reta.ded to go to the right office building iam at you Google the address it goes exactly to my building but they end up going to different building with a fuc.ing different address fuc.ing pisses me off.
"Isn't it amazing how google doesn't allow you to review this business (gov't sham of a service) and yet you come here and there's 1,000's of poor reviews? Business account allows you to enter your own address but won't ship there, allows you to enter phone numbers but CP policy restricts employees from calling. Phone in and they won't give you their name or employee ID, direct number or who their transferring you to. This is all after educating you on their policies but not solving the issues. Threaten to disconnect the call when you professionally hold them to account for their service issues... this is reason #7,892 why Canada is failing as a country."
I ordered a product from Miami it was supposed to go into my mail box or at my door but they put it in the lobby so everyone had access to it. Just a bunch of idi>ts to deal with don't like your job quit give it to someone that will do it right. And it was a woman maybe if a man delivered it would have bin put at my door or brought back to the post office so I could pick it up
I will refrain from ever using Canada Post for any packages. I'm on day 14 waiting for a package being delivered from Calgary to Edmonton and im told it hasn't even left your facility. Weird that I can't find any job postings for your facility since you are clearly understaffed. Or maybe you're just ignorant
"I ordered a package of diabetic glucose test strips
Kind of important for me. Paid for 2 day delivery
Has now been 7 days and still no package, no updates.
Customer service is useless. They have no idea where it is!!! This company is useless,they can‚Äôt even deliver a package from Toronto to Kingston!
Never again! Never again.
Ombudsman is useless as well.
Never again"
"Canada Post is a terrible delivery company it is the worst in Canada. Their customer service is horrible and extremely poor. Canada Post untrustworthy, irresponsible and careless. When I order items online, I make sure that the carrier is NOT Canada Post if it is, I cancel my order immediately because I refuse to support their horrible business!"
Bunch of scum bags working for Canada post that steals packages and the company can‚Äôt do anything about it. Don‚Äôt even bother calling for customer support because they are useless. how does everytime I order a large package it just magically disappear. Says it‚Äôs ready for pick up but the package is no where to be found at the post office for a entire week. Then all of a sudden it shows that the package been delivered when it clearly not.
"The postal worker that delivered our package was so rude. He threw the package instead of handing it over to my husband or just placing it on the door step. When confronted about his attitude, he just reluctantly said sorry. The whole incident was recorded as we have a camera on our driveway and a doorbell camera as well. Called to complain about this incident and was told that it will be investigated and someone will contact us. 5 days have passed and no phone call from them. Called Canada Post today to follow up and was told it was already resolved???. If it‚Äôs possible to give them 0 star, I would.üò°"
"I would give no stars if possible, Sent registered mail to the UK, but the letter was still in Richmond BC 8 days later. I am receiving mail from the UK a month after it was posted and that's if it arrives at all, At least 4 pieces of mail from the UK government did not arrive at all in the last several month. I thought at first it was the UK mail service, but now I know it is Canada post. My wife ordered eye glasses online and they were sent to Powel River not the interior where we live. when the eye glasses arrive the address was correct on the box. We order a lot from amazon and we have noticed Canada post is getting slower and slower. I will look into using courier service as much as I can from now on."
"Hate, hate HATE Canada post. Worst post service I've ever experienced and you never know who will use them. Everytime I order a product I cross my fingers and say ""PLEASE not Canada post"" because if they're involved then you've just wasted money.

Their couriers don't even BRING the package with them. I catch them all the time trying to sneak ""sorry we missed you"" slips through my door while I'm home. When I catch them in the act, they're empty handed, leaving my packages in the truck under the assumption I won't be home. THEN instead of bringing them to me upon request, they ask me to meet them at their truck when they're finished their route in X amount of time. Often they escape forcing me to pick up my package from a depot.

They also frequently just drive by my building without stopping before notifying me that they tried their hardest to deliver"
"DO NOT USE Canada Post unless to want to pay for a service you won't receive. I wasted $22.98 to send out my kids GRAD pics that alone cost me around $500 for 2 packages. It's clearly lost because they didn't even ask me all details needed for tracking. It's literally been SITTING FOR DAYS and now is delayed??? Delayed so you can find it again? I call in only to be told, I can't tell you anything (really helpful) said nobody ever. It was mailed on July 26, 2022 and only going 4 1/2 hours away and its STILL NOT THERE???????????? Now I'm told be Aug 12, 2022. Canada Post you WILL be paying for this! How irresponsible of Canada Post to be so reckless and irresponsible with a PAID service. NEVER again will I waste me time and money on such a company again."
"this is the worst postal service you can get and it's owned by the government so you cant do nothing against them. they are backed up by constitutive laws and dont care if they say 1 or 2 days delivery and it takes 1 week to get it and more. im not lying if i say that 9 package out of 10 i get are late and not by only 1 day, it's sometimes 2-3-4 days late (and im not counting the pandemic time when it took over 2 month to get a package). you pay the big price to get your package in time and you wont...the worst in that is they cant invest in better equipment/workers/delivery system because the bosses get the big cash bonus while doing nothing. every year it's getting worst. if you never felt powerless before, just use canada post and you're going to know what it feels like"
"So when canada post says ""overnight shipping"" what they really mean is ""maybe it'll get there in four days"" I chose overnight shipping to keep live insect specimens safe in the heat, but these useless smooth-brains can't even get that right. If they arrive dead I'm going to make sure every post worker I come across has a really bad day."
"Literally have dedicated Canada Post parcel lockers inside my condo building. 2 of my most recent packages had tracking show as ""left with concierge"", went on a wild goose chase to track them down, my building concierge even checked cameras to show that Canada Post never even came to my building on the day the tracking was showing as ""delivered and left with building concierge"". The concierge in my building doesn't even accept packages, and is fully aware we have dedicated Canada Post lockers in the mail room.

Contacted Canada Post and they said that I should contact the senders (H&M and Steve Madden) to open a claim with them and there was nothing they could do to help me. Thankfully I got refunded from the stores, even though it wasn't their fault. Unfortunately, the items I ordered had all sold out by that point so I couldn't even re-order them.

Just beyond outrageous. How does this happen in 2022? They clearly can track what deliveries are made by what drivers on which day. They should be embarrassed to call themselves a delivery company."
"Literally never on time, they don't update your parcel accurately (sometimes, just when upon receiving it you'll get like 4 updates about it which is totally bs and doesn't help) they charge ALOT for the ultra poor service they offer, I can't believe sometimes you just have to use CP cause they have a national monopoly.. trash company ran by trash people that only care about their personal gains
Also, their custommer service Sucks, they are always rude and mad at you for no reason when you're just tryna figure out where the fck your parcel is"
"Canada post keeps on misplacing my parcel that supposed to be delivered at my mailbox. Not once but three times! Now, They Lost a parcel and the agent I called cannot give any details to what had happened as it says in the tracking it was delivered but nothing on my mailbox! I hope companies will not use Canada post as courier as they messed up parcels as always!"
"Sh t company, but we have to use this to shipping inside Canada
And no tracking for international registered letter? Go fu k yourself"
"As others have said I would not have given any stars except I was forced to, as a matter of fact I would have given minus stars. Canada Post is a terrible company for a company that my taxes go to support, I think they all should be fired.. Have been waiting for a parcel for quite awhile. Been tracking it. I guess they take a scenic route to get anything to its destination. My package came from Ontario to Alberta, it was shipped on July 7th. It seems that parcels coming across Canada take a very long time to get to Edmonton, my estimated delivery date was July 25th, then the 28th, and now Aug 2nd, don‚Äôt think that will happen as it still hasn‚Äôt left Edmonton. It‚Äôs been there since July 25th!!! By the time it leaves Edmonton it will be almost a month since it was ordered. I‚Äôm thinking of contacting the company that I ordered from and telling them that it‚Äôs taken to long for delivery, and I don‚Äôt want the product anymore and will be refusing it when Canada Post does decide I am worthy of delivery."
"I ordered a item from Ebay and waited. It was listed a shipped, so I went my community mailbox and it wasn't there. They constantly send mail to the wrong houses and I have had to try and get refunds or get items resent, due to their incompetency."
"Expedited service is now 10 days delivery. Opened a ticket with agent and all they are doing is tracking parcel, well I can do that myself. Everyday is the same update, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.
FedEx will have a new customer, thanks a lot Canada Post, nice one giving business outside country. üëé"
"I‚Äôd give zero if I could.
I ordered a parcel 8 days before leaving for a trip, I paid the extra money for expedited shipping. I was supposed to receive my parcel within 1-3 days. Checked tracking yesterday, it stated delivery was on for today. Checked again this morning and it‚Äôs now bumped to next week. I contacted them as I will be in the area that my package is in right now wanting them to hold it so I could pick it up. Pick up is not available, how convenient. When contacting support, I requested a call back. The call back came from a Saskatoon #. I called the Mississauga office?
I had a hard time understanding the guy who called me so I requested a manager as there was a language barrier. There‚Äôs no manager. I had to hang up and call back. The next guy I got was so ignorant. Any question I asked he huffed before replying. Like I was an inconvenience and a bimbo. I asked if I could have it shipped elsewhere as I‚Äôd be out of town and didn‚Äôt want the package to get stolen off my porch, I was told no I‚Äôd be committing fraud ??
So now, I‚Äôm out $210, my clothing for my trip, and they can‚Äôt help me at all. Worst company to deal with!"
The worst service ever whenever I do online order and if it‚Äôs deliver by Canada post then never ever I receive my parcel every time they change the status to deliver but I never receive it and this time this happens with my couch I ordered it from Amazon and it should be delivered by Canada post but I never receive it how they miss that much big couch is that a small needle which is misplaced this is the disgusting company if Canada post want to do this every time then better than that they should close it and stay at home they don‚Äôt know how to work
"I was expecting an expensive item over the post from a far away place but the seller missed the unit number as it was a COD that needs to be collected from the Post Office. We created tickets to resolve this issue, called them informed about the issue and they were very sure that the item will be on hold for 2 days.
But people are so ignorant seems like they never check the support tickets, they have immediately sent the item back to the seller neglecting all the tickets and want us to pay again for the shipping and send the item again? is that negligence or cheap money making tactics?"
"IT TOOK 3 WEEKS FOR MY PACKAGE TO ARRIVE FINALLY FROM HONGKONG but guess what? Canada post sent it back because they couldn‚Äôt verify my address even though I called multiple times telling them my address, which was already correct in the first place. They also won‚Äôt let me Goto the post office and receive it because it was not in their policy. How convenient.
Now I have to wait for another month for the package to arrive to the sender and then pay extra shipping fees and wait another month and who knows Canada post might screw me over again."
"On July 14 a parcel was shipped to me from Carlisle, Ontario and I'm in Toronto Ontario. At the moment I have no idea where my package is and the rude agents at Customer service online don't have no answers for me and I was told there's no one else to speak to. This is the worst service ever. What is in the package is irreplaceable, cause I will not be able to get what's in the package again. so if canada post lost or damage my package I will have no choice but to get lawyers involve. I cannot understand how I ordered stuff from the US on Wednesday and it's here already yet something coming from ontario is taking so long. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE."
they are so f****** lazy i live in a tiny ass town and the goddamn everytime i order my monthly package wich i order on a sunday so its shipped monday and here by thursday I pay for the 3-4 bussiness day shipping and this is the 3rd f****** time its tooken 5+days. The worst part is i know where it is its in the goddamn canada post office in town here but they are too lazy to f****** get there people to go ship them out. How do they let these packs slide past the 3 day mark without it being delivered ? **** breaks my brain CANADAPOST is a f****** scam and a half just like rogers.
"Wow i was FORCED to give one star to complete the review, but they deserve ZERO, Canada Post is masterful at dropping the ball. Many times i have noticed my tracking info has been doctored after an update has been made, changing it to look like they are still on time. I regularly place an order for items from a business in BC, and am just blown away at the inconsistency of the delivery times to my home in SK. They often love to sit on my orders, when they arrive wed, or thurs, after a monday order, only to have me wait until the FOLLOWING monday. Their ""virtual assistant"", is useless. They have the nerve to post on their website they are working ""hard"" to ""stay safe"", blah blah, news flash, the rest of the world went back to normal service a YEAR ago. I would recommend, if at all possible, use another service."
"Canada Post has gone down the crapper big time! they used to be okay, now you cant even get your packages delivered on time even if you pay for Xpress Post they give the lame Ass excuses for the delays and please stop saying its use of Covid affected everyone but CP is milking it. They should also monitor there ""post men/women on Fridays, it seems that in Mascouche,Qc they like to take the day off on Friday, and our mail gets delivered on Monday instead even if its registered should arrive Friday. They should refund everyone who pays for xpress post service service if its delivered late!"
Worst service ever! Charging more to get mails later is just fraud! You send it better by a pigeon or fedex or ups than canada slowst
"Canada post is not reliable
Don‚Äôt bother paying extra for faster delivery, your package is going to come at the same speed no matter what you pay.
Only thing they are good for is if you need soMething delivered to your mail box and not your house."
"You ever wish for a delivery that is fast, reliable, and keep you posted (no pun intended screw these guys) on your parcel, well these guys are NOT FOR YOU! But sometimes they're your only choice since they drink the tit of our own government. Goofs."
"They have lost 5 of my parcels in the last ten years, three in the last year. No other carrier has lost parcels to my address. This shows incredibly dishonesty or ineptness of the carriers. It also then took me 2 weeks to get a refund for one of my parcels because they refused to believe my parcel was lost. I had to get staff in my building to watch security footage of the time of delivery to prove it wasn't delivered. Why does any company even use Canada Post anymore? They are by far the worst delivery service available. I would give them 0 stars if possible."
"Fast and awful customer support and lazy policies

Refused to deliver to my door and then sent a message saying they ""attempted delivery"". When asking a support person, they simply said I have to pick it up and they cannot possibly reschedule a delivery because of their policy. They didn't even leave a slip regarding the pick up information."
My dogs medication I ordered on the 6th it is the 14th and still haven‚Äôt received it. I paid $24.00 for expedited delivery. They take your money and don‚Äôt deliver. THEY MADE THE MISTAKE OF SENDING IT TO THE WRONG AREA. My poor dog is in so so much pain. They did this prior with my husbands meds I didn‚Äôt receive it bc the mail man didn‚Äôt want to drive in a puddle. I wish they would get rid of Canada Post it‚Äôs really gone down hill so unprofessional
A place where thieves are hired and thrive. I don't trust Canada Post one bit. They are thieves. Have had my parcels stolen by these insider thieves several times.
"absolutely the worst experience. Drives to my place and just places the note saying come pick it up.

I take it that Canada post does not deliver to the door any more.. as this has not been the only time this is happened. They are truly a bunch of idiot managers there at Canada post for not attempting to fix this problem. The CEO of CP should fire those Managers they are not looking for the companies best interest

Fire Them ASAP!

What a shame"
"Took 13 days to ship a item from Ontario to New Brunswick, I've never seen lazier than you guys. You're the worst."
Canada post driver refuses to bring my packages to my home.
This is what happens when you let government do all: you get laziest human paper weights in society do less and less and cry more and more money. Multiply this 1 star rating to all services ran by THE CANADIAN government.
workers should be ashamed and the bureaucrats running it even more so. keep voting for lefties aka play stupid games win stupid prizes. this is what you get when you buy into Trudeau's socialism.
Canada post has got to be the most incompetent company there is. Time for the Canadaian government to step in and award the mail contracts to a company that can handle the job. Always on strike wanting more money and these clowns can't even do their f****** job properly. How many more pissed off 1 star reviews do they need to get before something gets f****** done? What a joke!
So almost every week I have a package coming And there is no safe Drop And every time the mail lady does not have my package but she says she cannot put it in my mailbox And she never has it on her obviously because it's not at the Post Office to pick up whoever delivers on Angela street sucks ass They should hire people that actually want to do the job
"Had a awful experience with Canada post delivery was suppose to take 3 days and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and when I contacted them to make sure my address was good, they just returned to sender and didn‚Äôt even contact me to let me know."
"They promised 6-10 days and it's been over 2 weeks.

Update: They replied ""delay due to covid"" and expected delivery time extended 1 month to 3 months. Received in one month.
Although another parcel from the US took just 6 days to arrive."
Even 1 star is too much. Why I have to pay an insurance for damages they do? Constantly destroying or loosing mail and no punishment for them. All they can do all the time is to go on strike that they paid not enough. With service you provide you way overpaid!!!
Really disappointed with Canada post.maill and package mix-up and lost.when we call customer support team was not helpful.
"Slow very slow hense snail mail
It is wrong that Canada post is paying some of its employees over 30 a hour for sorting letters and mail thats
Canada oost system is old needs to be updated
Bring in robots to replace anyone who is getting paid 30 or more dollers a hour

Perhaps lower your rates and do more for our country
No wonder they are always short handed
Waited in line for 45 mins just to get stamps"
I only gave a star because I have to. This is the worst service with the worst customer service in business. Carriers are beyond lazy and refuse to deliver to the door so you have to go to the post office to pick it up even if you pay for that service! If it wasn‚Äôt a government run operation they would have been out of business decades ago. I only use when no other option is available.USE ANY OTHER SERVICE AVAILABLE
No big deal to me......I've been waiting on a parcel from BC to Calgary since August 2021...... never delivered......possible sitting in lost mail warehouse thing which after a small amount of time if it's not claimed they destroy it! Irreplaceable and sentimental lost/possibly destroyed items and people still trust this company.........
"Useless and they don't care. Why would a company who cares about their reputation ever, ever use Canada Post?"
"I was sent a parcel from Ukraine, and it has been in Canada for a long time, and Canada has not brought it to the post for 2 weeks. each time the parcel either disappears or is delivered for months"
"Worst service ever, frst and last time using itü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ"
"Simply a lazy and DGAF organization because it is run by the government. They will ignore your delivery instruction and go their way without any communication, explanation, understanding, and no reflecting process.
CanadaPost you will be getting F'd, coz more and more retailers get complaints about CP and they are looking for alternative carriers - a normal one.

Cherry on top: there is a website with all feedback withe Canadapost: whatswrongwithcanadapost"
I had a package shipped expedited arrived a month late and was put in my community mail box even though the instructions said front door. These ppl demand more money but do pretty much no work drive to community boxes and just stuff em in if you gave these jobs to students you would have way better service.
"Representatives are unprofessional and lack knowledge, delivery customization is minimal, little to no care/measure for people with disabilities."
"My experience with Canada Post has been normal until now, the person who was there that day was rude and very passive aggressive, she didn't even try to do her job, I work for the local Hospital, I get it, ppl are just ppl ,but there are Red flags when you dislike your job ,and you treat ppl like they are a bother, maybe is time to find something where there are no human interaction
Thanks for making me look for different ways to send and receive packages üì¶"
"Canada post provided very sick and bad service. I never recommend it. I sent my parcel internationally. Even i could not track it after it was showing stuck in scarbrough. I contacted them they were just asking me about items and contents of parcel. I told them hundred of times but they were just giving me further dates. After 2.5 months they told me it's lost. Such a stupid service i ever had. Shame on canada post . They don't value people and their trust.
I recommend that never trust them."
"Horrible.
two times I got to receive items from this company. one time a MacBook, second time a really important package worth 350$. The MacBook was 1 month late without any other information apart ""flight delayed"" for a whole week. 2500$ MacBook, I mean... wth? I will never trust the company with any important item again. And today, my other package is supposed to arrive. It was supposed to be by my door last week too. But you know what? Tomorrow, I will have another expected delivery date, probably next week again. I don't even know when I will really get it, because it seems like they don't even have processed it already. Such a bad service, I've never seen that."
"This happens all the time! And again, I am waiting for a parcel which is very very important that even the sellers gave me a special favour to get it to my door on time.

BUT! Stuck again due to pathetic lord minded service of Canada post. Plus, whenever their website tells you it‚Äôs delivered means your parcel not even reached to the post office. Second their post office are active on Saturdays which should be linked to mentioned notices from Fridays.

But they won‚Äôt because they says it‚Äôs not a business day from where it distributed. It‚Äôs a kind of major miss management example from an authentic Canadian department.

Simply disappointing‚Ä¶"
"I'm waiting for a package to be delivered today. The website, when provided with the tracking number, continues to display: ""Expected delivery: Today"". So, I waited at home. It's now 10pm on a Friday night. The package is obviously not coming today and won't be delivered now until Monday.

Advice:
1. Update your website to reflect current status.
2. When a customer provides you with their email in order to be notified, then send out a notification when warranted. I received no email today to warn me that the package would not be delivered. So, why did I provide my email??

This is basic functionality and you can't even do that. The reason? You simply don't care. That or you don't have any PM's, BAs, developers, or QA. You should be embarrased."
"Very unfriendly. My neighbors get packages from FedEx or Purolator in the lobby or in front of their door.
My package from VistaPrint was sent back for having only my unique name and address, but not the apartment number. It was though on the billing address. When the tracking notified me it was arrived, I went to the canadapost office (L5A 1W0) on the 22nd of June and was told to come next day. Next day they told me that my package was sent back already the previous day. Narrow minded, unfriendly."
"Lost an item I sold for over $350 now I'm out of pocket. Offer me $13 for the shipping charge. What a joke, terrible company. Items don't just disappear from the city they are supposed be delivered in."
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. The sheer incompetence and laziness of Canada Post seems to be common practice.
There has been countless issues in the short time I‚Äôve lived in Canada. Missing items, no attempt to deliver, smashed and damaged packages, rude staff, etc‚Ä¶

Most recently they claimed to have missed me and couldn‚Äôt deliver an item, which is impossible as I was home all day, the tracking updated to say a delivery notice was left. Surprise, surprise there was no notice, no instructions for pick up, nothing. I have to chat with a bot on the Canada Post website to be given a delivery notice number‚Ä¶ I was told to show up at the post office with my ID and quote the number. Leaving no notice cards after lying about attempted delivery seems to be the norm.

They are a complete waste of time and effort, if you can, avoid Canada Post at all costs. The only thing they guarantee is disappointment."
"I‚Äôve live in many cities around the globe before residing in Quebec as an expat, but never have I encountered a postal service as horrible, slow and with zero accountability as Canada Post. Even the post services offered in third world countries are far much more reliable and efficient than Canada Post. Unbelievable! Waiting to receive important letters sent via Canada Post is a great torture and caused me so much disapointment (I have no control over the choice of courier made by the sender considering it‚Äôs from governmental organizations). My requests for assistance in understanding why the letters are always undelivered were not attended by Canada Post as well. Sighhh."
"How is this.
My parcel was picked up in Richmond, BC to be delivered to Calgary June 16.
Today I get a phone call from the company confirming my address cause Canada post sent it back to them. How is it they can return a package that never even made it to Calgary in the first place. If you go on their website to track it, according to them it‚Äôs suppose to arrive tomorrow. I also have another package coming from the same company that says on Canada post it‚Äôs to be delivered today. So not impressed with this service."
"Useless and unreliable. My package is lost, It was mark delivered to community mailbox but no key left for me to open mailbox. Contacted customer service and they did investigation but no luck and no follow up to me. How can my parcel get lost if they put it in right spot? My package is lost now I am very frustated. I think the mailman left the key on wrong place and my neighbor took my package or the mailman might bought it home. What an heartless company their workes don't even give a damn and sympathy. What a joke."
"I suppose to receive my items today but didn‚Äôt as I was expecting. I had previously a bad experience with this unprofessional company. I hope I‚Äôll receive my plant tomorrow. It might die if they take so long to deliver it to my place. Last item I did purchase took me almost 3 months to receive it. I‚Äôm very discouraged cuz I can‚Äôt do anything but wait. It unfair and they don‚Äôt even care. No communication skills, nothing."
I ordered a package that Canada post was delivering they said it‚Äôs delivered and nothing . No package no packing slip and no key for the parcel box . I made a complaint and they did a 3 day investigation which led to nothing . I ordered vape pens and I‚Äôm thinking that someone recognized the sender address and they took the package and said it was delivered . Anyway they havnt got back to me about anything and it‚Äôs been almost a week . This is the last time I‚Äôll ever use them it‚Äôs completely a waste of time trying to figure out where my package is and got nothing back from now now I‚Äôm out of 100 bucks . Thanks for nothing Canada post . What a joke
"I understand the pandemic made things hard for postal services, etc. But every package that comes to Kamloops, BC, Canada ends up delayed for days if not weeks, and I've now had my 4th package lost. So frustrated."
"ABUSIVE REPRESENTATIVES NAMED NATALIE AND MANGIE OVER BASIC QUESTIONS...IF YOU ASK FOR A SUPERVISOR, THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU ,THEY TOOK PLEASURE IN ME BEING ABUSED, SO THEY ABUSED ME FURTHER, THEY ARE VERY SICK PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT DESERVE THE JOBS THEY HAVE. IF THEY WANT TO BE SO EVIL, THEY NEED TO GO TO THE STATES. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW THEY TREAT CANADIANS. DISGUSTING."
Canada post lost my last two envelopes with valuable items in them. Return address on and still never did come back to me. ‚ÄúNothing we can do‚Äù is their fabulous response. Very unpleased with their customer service.
"What is it called when you pay for a service and it is not rendered? Fraud. This is what Canada Post does, they say you'll get tracking but the tracking page stays empty, they give you a delivery date, but you never get it on time. Canada Post should be scrapped, they're unaccountable for the many package they lose and their management couldn't organize a kid's birthday party."
"I'm so angry! I ordered my item TWO WEEKS AGO it STILL hasn't been delivered, it's is COMPLETELY UNFAIR that my item went to a whole other province and STILL isn't at my damn door. I ordered this item two hours from me and it went out of Ontario to me SORTED??!! I have had to buy product in town costing me an additional $70.00 because of this. Is there resolution? Nope Canada post doesn't care. Guess what happens when it is ready to be delivered? They don't bring the parcel, they NEVER do. I get a slip on my door, and then I have to wait an additional day before I can pick it up. Canada post? Do not recommend.id rather a 0 star review, but there's no option."
I don‚Äôt like the service at all. I got a notification from canada post that my expected delivery of parcel on 13 May but I did get any parcel. I was so excited but now I‚Äôm like why you guys just give me hope. I just don‚Äôt like that‚Äôs all. That‚Äôs just my experience.
worst service ever. Asked to talk at phone with an agent but appears that it's impossible
Damage every package measure the dimensions of packages wrong even tho they're printed on the box and charge me extra after they're already sent.
Horrible courier. If they noticed where you live has a mailbox even if it‚Äôs not yours they will assume and drop your package there. This gave me lots of distress and anxiety. The rep even end chat on me. Now am scared to order something online because it might come through Canada post
"Unreliable service, bad service. They couldn't help find a parcel that was not received by the end user."
"The canada post at shoppers drugmart in square one has the worst lazy spiteful workers there. There were two workers, one worker was helping a guy before me for 30 minutes and did not resolve his issue even at the end. The whole time other worker was just walking around doing nothing, there were two counters and one counter was FREE I do not understand why she was not at the other counter helping other customers??? I needed to return something the two workers told me to wait and made me wait for 30-40 minutes. One of them could've just processed my return quickly at the other available counter but she was busy walking around doing nothing. After 30-40 minutes The person before me left the post office frustrated because they did not resolve his issue and the workers finally processed my return in like 10 seconds which could've been done so 30-40 minutes before. Such sad customer service, inefficient staff, making customers wait unnecessarily. Both staff were at the same counter for no reason."
"Bloody id10ts. USPS gets package en route from the USA from a southern state all the way to JFK in ONE day. It then sits in Canada Post's Mississauga warehouse for two days before being released and ends up in Thunder Bay (3rd day), then Winnepeg Manitoba (4th day). I *live* in Mississauga :( Upon realizing the package has been mis-processed, Canada Post now needs to get it back to Mississauga which will be another two days minimum. Shameful doesn't begin to describe it."
"It‚Äôs so shameful that a country which has cities like Vancouver that are rated as one of the best cities to live in the world, the postal service of such a country has such a bad reputation but the authorities don‚Äôt care a damn to improve the quality of service. Now there is no pandemic or natural disaster or festival but still passport delivery takes much longer compared to even the underdeveloped countries. My personal experience recently has been very very painful waiting for my sons passport."
"I had to give a 1 star so i can respond to the Canada Post service..I make a lot of purchases on Amazon and most of the carriers are about average for deliverys, BUT....Canada Post has got to be the WORST and after reading a lot of reviews about them , i am not alone in saying that....I want you to read these updates....

I would give zero if i could. We have been working with Canada Post for more than 5 years now. And every year their services have gotten worse than before. I cant belive this is just the start of the new year and they have already lost multiple orders that would cost hundreds and thousands.
"Besides losing packages (whole other story) they never actually deliver my packages. EVERY single time, they give me a slip to notify where I can pick up my package at one of their locations. Happens every time regardless of the price or size of the package. I work from home due to covid so I'm always home and the driver never rings the door bell or knocks at the door, just drops off the slip and leaves. Literally a delivery company that doesn't deliver."
"How do your people not know how to read an address. My address was correct and it was confirmed with the sender as well, so why all the processing errors and insufficient address. Now I have to wait for my package to go from Canada to China again so that it can be resent to me. It's already been 3 weeks.
There was no notification that this was not being delivered until it said returning to sender. This is ridiculous and it happens quite often. I contacted Canada Post and they had no answer to me and they shrug it off that they can't do anything now that it's on its way back. I see now that it was reprocessed multiple times in one day but no one contacted me to confirm the address."
"I sent a package to Gatineau, Qu√©bec on Tuesday May 31st, 2022 (which is by car at about 2 1/2 hour from where I live here in the province of Qu√©bec.

I paid exactly $13.44 (taxes included) to have the package sent faster and what I thought would be more secure (without risking to be lost).

Thank God I kept the receipt with the tracking number, etc...

The package did arrive at the closest post office that is at about a 5 minutes' walk from the address on the enveloppe, which is the correct address on Friday June 3rd, 2022.

The place where the package was supposed to be delivered is an elderlies' residence, and no one does expect for any of them to have to go to a post office to get their mail when that mail is very correctly addressed to them.

I certainly did not pay that mount to have it delivered to a...post offcie...

The recipient's daughter is telling me that she will ask her mother to go and get it. I hope she will go... Or find someone to go for her. (I called the residence where she lives and asked to leave a message for her (to let her know that the package was stuck at the post office)- the lady on the phone strictly refused to take any messages, and then I asked her if there was anyone who could go get the package, explaining to her that I had paid an expensive fee to send it to her, etc.... She only replied ""her daughter will go, she comes to see her often"". Well, her daughter lives at 1 hour away from there, and does not go as often as the lady on the phone seemed to think..

How rude !

The package will be at the post office until June 18th.

Why paying much more than the regular fee if packages are delivered at a nearby post office and will surely not have to be signed for ???

I will try to talk to someone at Canada Post (so far, it has been impossible, there are only automated (robot) messages...to find out more on this..;.

NEVER AGAIN will I be using Canada Post to write to the lady ! There are tons of carriers around here !

If I could put a zero I would.

..............................................................................

UPDATE: Monday June 6th (2022). This morning, it says ""Out for delivery"".

To be continued and updated...

UPDATE: Friday June 8th, 2022. The lady FINALLY got the package tonight."
"This has to be most frustrating and slow delivery company in the world, May 24th I ordered an phone and it took 2 days to just say shipping is labeled then ,5days later it said its been shipped then it disappeared and said nothing then it's been shipped again and now it's almost 2 weeks stil no update."
"Never trust your confidential documents!
Your certificates and passport can get lost without any reasonable explanation."
"It's hard to believe that Post Canada is paid with our fu*king tax, but we cant even get an okay service! No update on my parcel for 18 days, noe I'm receiving 4 times the same notifications 4 days straight, mentioning my parcel is hold for custom review.. C'mon! It's not Christmas time. It must be by far THE WORSE WORSE WORSE delivery, post company ever. You can't blame covid no more so at this point this company is just purely useless."
Courier company that does not deliver to the door if you require a signature... thats actually not a courier company.
"This is the worst customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had!! Was expecting a parcel to be delivered to my home address, all was well until I verified the tracking on Canada Post advising that my package was on hold until my address could be verified. Called Canada Post customer service, was told that my package was already returned to sender! Apparently the law is that we, the customer, have a max of 2 hours to contact Canada Post and confirm the address??? Even though I called within hour of this update, the lady said there was nothing they could do. All she suggested was that I track my package more closely???? Apparently we are to have our tracking on our phone opened 24 hours a day!! Lol üòÇ

Not only did Canada Post have my correct address the whole time, the sender was nice enough to send me a new shipment again, but believe it or not, Canada Post resent that parcel back!!!

It‚Äôs insane , no notifications, no apologies, only a nice little auto message when call advising that they do not tolerate any verbal abuse or aggressive behavior on the phone‚Ä¶. if people there actually did their job like their supposed to, then perhaps people wouldn‚Äôt be frustrated when they call!!!

I tend to never wish for people to lose their jobs, but this company is absolute trash and a utter joke!"
"Every time I‚Äôm set to receive a parcel and I see the seller has chosen Canada Post , I immediately know the package will A) be delayed for no reason at all. B) be lost or never received. C) arrive damaged.
This is the WORST company ever. I wish sellers would give you the option of paying extra to deliver with a good company. So annoying that you don‚Äôt know which company a seller is using until it is too late!"
"A service third world like. They damage mail, lose packages as well as notification tickets. Can't bother knocking, can't bother putting mail properly through the mailbox. Literally an ape could do better.
On top of that, their customer service is made up by literal a**holes. Never helpful, never apologetic, never follow through with anything. At best they speak like an algorithm, at worst they straight up insult you.
Can't wait for the day all these folks lose their jobs to an AI. For how dehumanizing and disrespectfully they treat you, might as well deal with a bot."
Terrible to think that are National mail service is horrible and unreliable. Disgrace indeed. Im still waiting for a parcel from NS and im in Ontario 9 days late.
"On May 17th, 2022 I had to return an online order back to Walmart Canada so I had to return it via Cda Post. I dropped it off and got a receipt with the tracking # on it. Guess what? Today is May 31st 2022 & MY ITEM STILL HASN'T BEEN RETURNED TO WALMART IN MILTON, ONTARIO.
I have no idea where the heck this parcel is but it doesn't surprised me at all. I would give Cda Post a -10 rating if I could. I had to raise hell with Walmart to get my refund on my credit card as I was initially told that they wouldn't credit me back until they received my return item.
Walmart paid for the return shipping so not my problem anymore. This is what happens when Walmart uses bottom feeder couriers like Canada Post. Things get delayed; this get lost, etc.
When will Walmart ever smarten up and quit using Canada Post as they are just SO UNRELIABLE!"
"Just plain lazy people not doing their jobs. I‚Äôve never once had a package successfully delivered to my location, not once! It‚Äôs been about 15 packages now and they just don‚Äôt do it, sometimes I don‚Äôt even get my delivery notice. Terrible service and if you can chose something else save yourself the hassle and do it."
"Now the original mail man is beyond amazing. He's friendly, and polite and does his job well. But the other mail persons do a pathetic job. I was expecting mail yesterday that went to the post office instead of them buzzing my buzzer which is on all of my parcels. And today another parcel that doesn't fit in my mailbox like yesterday's was delivered by a female mail lady and she buzzed to get let in, and deliver it like any mail worker should.
Half ass jobs shouldn't be allowed. I called customer service and was told that's not part of their job. So delivering mail to people isn't part of their job now? So what is? Yall got to do better Canada Post"
I mailed a small package from BC to Alberta and it's been 4 weeks and hasn't arrived. They charged me $20 for postage and then stole my package. They will not even respond to my complaint. Avoid using Canada Post at all costs. Thieves.
Deliver package home 1 time outta 10. Customer service use covid as an escape to warrant never sending the package to home and instead just send it t the post office... You know... tax paying canadian peoples who paid their delivery service to get their package HOME!
"Why does this company even still exist? Don't waste your time and money on this outdated institution.
Go with a carrier that actually 'delivers'."
"Canada Post are unfortunately used by Amazon and they choose the lowest standard of NOT delivering and flat out LYING that a package was ""undeliverable"" when I was home all day, weather was beautiful... NO excuse. Happens all the time while other carriers have 100% delivery rate."
"ALWAYS LATE. Used a slip instead of the parcel box... on FRIDAY. Have NEVER not let me down. absolutely useless, no accountability, and crap customer service. a WASTE of tax dollars. I'd be fired 7 times over if I was as bad at my job as they are."
"Merchants PLEASE PLEASE don‚Äôt choose Canada post. I won‚Äôt do any online shopping if the package is shipped by Canada Post.
The mail man don‚Äôt make an effort to deliver the package :)"
"Canada Post deliver to door is a scam! They never even attemp to delivery your packages to door, they just leave you a note asking you to pick it up yourself without evening knocking on your doors. I have never once received a package when I was at home, all I got was email telling me ""they had failed attempt to deliver it to me‚Äù and found a note lying somewhere outside, while I was anxiously waiting for my parcel to arrive at home. When you check your tracking information, they usually already decided that they would leave a note before the parcel was about to be delivered. When you complain to customer service, they will lie to you giving many excuses including sender chose not to send to doors. I hope they run out of business soon."
"Something very suspicious is going on at the Vancouver/Victoria locations. I had four packages come through Canada post over this past month. 2/4 times I had issues, which doesn't bode well if someone orders online regularly. One might inquire, what's exactly changed at these locations? It's recently come to my attention that Canada post has been hiring copious amounts people where English (possibly refugees?) isn't their native tongue. When I was having issues with my first package, the lovely lady on the phone told me their delivery driver was new, and had issues reading my address on the label... I was dumbfounded. So that's why my first package was two days late?!?! Makes sense... Could these foreigners also be the ones responsible for stealing packages, I wonder? Is that why packages have been 'OUT FOR DELIVERY' for days - or even weeks on end without any updates? What's even more shocking is the fact I'm not the only person reporting these issues. Avoid Canada post like the plague until CBC's latest issue of ""go public"" goes live on TV. This is definitely something I'll be inquiring about. Will also be in contact with my ombudsman."
"I have a carrier that doesn't do his job when delivering mail. I work at kingsgate mall, and the carrier doesn't deliver our mail to us. But puts it on a table at the front of the store. When i called the carrier back to talk to him I asked hime to please take it to our counter, The carrier told me no problem, Then 20mins later comes back to our store and told us he would be cancelling our mail service. I made a phone call in complaint, But this hasn't bin resolved at all. The very next day the carrier walked past our store grinning at us. It has now been 3 weeks with no mail delivery. What is the point of having carriers or canada post if they don't do their job why do we even have or use canada post when they can cancel mail service without just cause."
"My mom sent me a package from Dawson creek bc to Alberta which everything else that came took maybe 4 to 5 days depending on the weather. Something that was sent on may 11 shouldn't have taken so long so she went and got them to track the package and Canada post said it was delivered to my mailbox may 14 weird since I check the mail everyday. So the swore it got delivered so they opened a investigation to see where it was or what happened. Well tonight ironically I was taking some garbage out turned around and something white caught my eye, huh would u look at that but I thought my package was delivered 2 weeks ago. Came in took a pic and sent it to my mom...get ur crap together Canada Post, in my 35 years of sending and receiving mail of all sizes I've never had an issue til now."
"Worthless bottom dwellers. To think these entitled clowns are actually unionized is nothing more than an absolute disgrace to people that actually deserve it. People pilfering packages, leaving packages ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù for weeks on end with no updates. If your package is in limbo, you‚Äôre basically SOL. I could write an entire essay, but I‚Äôve more important things to do."
"where is my package? im sure millions have asked the same damn question. whelp, once its says there is a delay in transit with no delivery date mentioned on their tracking website, it means its lost forever, you will not see your package, nobody knows, nobody cares, don‚Äôt even bother to inquire about it because they sure as hell don‚Äôt got a clue. i want my t-shirts god dammit!!!! arghh!"
Canada Post offers Small Packet Air with a so-called tracking number. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!! The tracking number cannot be tracked outside of Canada so it is useless. On top of that they will not reimburse you for a lost package even though you have a tracking number. Completely ****** service!!
"My package of knitting wool from Ireland was received by Canada Post (CP) April 26, 2022. The trouble began here. My package was presented to customs according to the CP tracking info, however after numerous phone calls and escalation of the issue to Canada Border Services, I found out the package was not presented to Customs by Canada Post. Further, Customs said that false info on the CP site is not uncommon. Making matters worse, although CP and Customs are in the same warehouse building in Mississauga, they don't speak with one another so I had to call each one delivering messages back and forth to find out which one had lost my package. Ridiculous! CP created a ""ticket"" yesterday because my package was officially missing. I am to start an online knitting class on May 26 and need the materials in the lost package. When I followed up with CP today about progress on their search for the missing package, I was told the ""investigating team"" was responsible for finding it and the agent on the phone said no info was available and he would not reach out to the investigating team on my behalf to see if the package had been located. So why are we paying these people who can't speak to their colleagues to follow up for a customer, if they're only offer of service is saying ""sorry, can't help you."" it's better off to just not speak to anyone ... reduces anger and frustration. If he can't pick up the phone, or perhaps take a few steps to the person at the desk two feet away, what is the point of a customer service rep? There is a big communication/liaison problem with CP internally, and a bigger one between CP and Canada Border Services. They need to be able to speak with each other to resolve customer issues/lost packages. The attitude of the agent who was unwilling to follow up, or the dysfunctional policies that prevent the agent from communication with other parties to the issue, not sure which it is, is is one problem amongst many that could be easily fixed."
"I F-ING !!!HATE!!! CANADA POST!!! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??? IF YOU SAY YOU WILL DELIVER A PACKAGE ON A SPECIFIC DATE... THEN F-ING DO IT!!! EVERY SINGLE F-ING TIME THAT I'M EXPECTING A PACKAGE, IT IS LATE 10 OUT OF 10 TIMES!!! EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!
EVERYONE AT CANADA POST, EVERYONE, SHOULD BE FIRED, AND THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED. THEN THEY SHOULD HIRE ALL NEW EMPLOYEES THAT ACTUALLY
F-ING CARE!!!

IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE, !!! DO NOT!!! USE CANADA POST!!!

I F-ING HATE CANADA POST!!! THEY ARE ALL F-ING MORONS THAT DO NOT CARE AT ALL!!!"
"unbelievable, deliver package without signature from the receiver, loss my package"
Parcel arrived from UK to recipients door in 6 days including clearing customs at both London and Vancouver. Great job.
"I am from St-Jean-sur-Richelieu. It took 4 months to finally have a book arrive at my post office. I was so happy when I saw the status Delivered, I hurried there to find my mailbox empty?!? Went I crossed the door to ask them what happened to my package. According to them, it was delivered, but they don't know to whom. Tried to negotiate with them but to no avail. They just lost my package. And me, I lost my money. Since the status is Delivered, I can't have my money back from the vendor. Made an official complaint, but I could see that they don't give a damn about the customer. I hate Post Canada deeply."
"Crap company. They lost my package worth over $200 going between two major cities in Ontario. It never left the Canada Post facility and is stuck in a corner or stolen. Their tracking website says 'stay tuned for updates' but weeks later there are no updates. I had to open an investigation with Canada Post and the seller. I'm out $200+ with no product, and I have to waste my time."
"If you want an item to never arrive at destination or get stolen, use Canada Post.
Item sent to 15 km. 3 years ago never arrived."
"I sent a parcel to Australia on march 22,2022 paid canada post abt 260$,,I don‚Äôt know where my parcel is?No responsibility from canada post"
"Always I thought that Mexico has the worst post service but I was wrong, it is Canada that has the worst of the worst post service, it took 11 days for Canda post office/service to send my package (101.00 Canadian dollars) from Mississauga to Mexico. 11 days my package was stored who knows where, what kind of service is this??!! we pay high fees to Canada Post in order to delivery good service but again a crap service, this is unacceptable."
"The worst company in Canada.lost around 200$ so far and it doesn‚Äôt even worth to call them, lost 4 hours on phone.fu"
"First of all, the parcel came with ship from Turkey because I paid money for air. In addition, the box's undercwas open and some items were missing. Lastly they could not bring to my home and I called the customer service and chatted with some people but they couldn't help me. I am disappointed."
"Canada post couldn't organise a p*ss up in a brewery.
You can't contact them.
They're rude.
Don't bother paying for tracking cause they'll loose it anyway.
Good luck trying to claim for your lost item.
Absolute s*it show."
Fuqqin unbelievably horrible service. They do not even deserve a 1 star rating. I paid for express post shipping. I LIVE IN THE SAME CITY. ON THE 6th DAY MY PACKAGE FINALLY SAYS OUT FOR DELIVERY. IT SAYS DELIVERED. I IMMEDIATELY GO CHECK AND IT IS NOT THERE. THEY DELIVERED IT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. Don‚Äôt ever use Canada post they are horrible
Well there website sucks hard navigation keeps.asking to do shipping doucment over and over
"There isn't a word in the English language that can even come close to the level of incompetency displayed by the lead paint drinkers who seem to run our glorious Canada owned postal service. It is so bad, I dread whenever an online seller selects Canada post as the method of delivery due to the fact almost everything that goes through Canada post is lost with no explanation given. This year alone, I have had 4 out of 5 packages that have had the misfortune of going through this horrid service go missing into the ether seemingly, to the point I wonder why we the tax payers are forced to back this buffoonery."
"I have always had issues with Canada Post, but this one has got me puzzled. Package hasn't moved from Mississauga for 4 days. Item processed twice over the course of two days on the weekend? Also Canada Post is unable to provide basic package information to receivers such as package size and weight, even tho these are fairly pertinent to shipping. Why is this information unavailable? It's clearly labeled on shipping labels and is fairly important throughout the shipping process."
"Canada Post is the worst courier service I‚Äôve dealt with. They lost my package, started an investigation, and told me to handle it with the sender. They were the ones who messed up so they should take accountability. Their customer services agents are also hit or miss. So you better hope you speak with someone professional as opposed to an agent who rushes the call to get you to hang up."
They cut through the package I sent to my mother and ruined her mother's day gift. The gift was destroyed.
"Had a terrible experience going back and forth with customer service. It was terrible - unresolved international parcel, long story. Anyways today spoke with Natasha from customer service. Fantastic representative of a large scale company. Not only did she compose herself professionally over the phone, but she went above and beyond to rectify my issue. She was a pleasure to deal with and has overall made a huge impact on why I will continue to do business with Canada Post. Thank you Natasha and I hope your employer sees this review!"
"A canada post driver, Ronald Abinoja, rear ended my vehicle while I was at full stop and waiting for the signal. When I went out, he was talking on the phone. After the long conversation, he came out and blamed that I stopped abruptly at yellow, but it was already red even before I was prepared to stop.
This such a big company didn‚Äôt apologize for my injuries and the accident that was caused by their employee, and refused to pay for the extra loss that the insurance didn‚Äôt cover.
It‚Äôs shameful that the company hired someone like him who threatens other driver‚Äôs life by talking on the phone while driving.
No matter what, I‚Äôm still injured and they avoided the situation irresponsibly by blaming others for their fault.
I would rather use ups or fedex than stupid canada post."
I sent my mother her Mother's Day parcel and Canada Post advised it was delivered to a community mail box. The community box was empty when it was opened. Parcel was not there. Also mail for another recipient was in my mother's mail box. She kindly hand delivered it to the person it belonged to. Mail has been repeatedly mishandled in this apartment building. There is a lack of attention to detail from Canada Post. How hard is it to read a number and put it in the right box? Service tickets are available to report a problem but take over a week or two. If you call support they can only help set up a service ticket. So disappointed with Canada Post Carriers who can't do their job.
"I paid customs duty online in advance of pick up ,no POP email ,no information update on the post office computer so they want me to pay again and receive a refund cheque in the main maybe 10 days. Thieves ,why are these guys not privatized , completely useless ,I will sue them for my time before I pay and wait. To be prompted to pay online then no proof or help ,disgusting system."
They lost my gift parcel was worth around $385 i am the one calling them never called me back while inquiry. Don‚Äôt even want them to rate one star.
Worst customer service I've ever experienced...
"Really? F this garbage company. Not even talking about how much money they charge, they just never deliver them on time. Like why on earth does this company exist, why are you delaying and rescheduling every single time? At least try to do the job plz. F Canada government, feeling ashamed of paying so much taxes for everything to this loser government."
"incredibly poor and slow service. the tracking number says my package sat in a warehouse for the past few days with zero movement, what do the employees do all day? its destination is only 2 hours from me, the fact that Canada post says it will take over a week to deliver is absolutely absurd. time to get rid of this useless company"
"The postman just brings one of those Delivery notice slips and not the package, I was watching him from the window. Then he claims no one was home. Yeah, are you telepathic? try knocking or buzzing the door. Or at the very least BRING the package that was for this delivery. I called customer service and they said the shipper requested that I go pick up the package from a store and sign for it. Yeah, ok, Amazon prime requested this. So I go to the Canada Post store, they tell me no need to sign."
"the worst company to handle personal packages or letters.purchased an product from a company in london ontario to deliver it to mississauga ontario 8 day and yet nothing they seem to have there own rules which includes we don not give a dam get it when we say you get it.IS THIS TAXPAYERS MONEY AT WORK.the best part is they will not take responsiblity for anything.they have you at there mercy.go figure these people get a good wage,a pension and who knows what else oh and the best part try to talk to someone in a resinable time. on the phone for a hour and no one knows anything they just pass you on to next person who can not help you.oh ya they say call the sender to restart this process"
Terrible service.. takes forever to arrive really disappointed.
"My Xpresspost package from Toronto took 5 business days to arrive in Charlotte, NC, USA, even though Canada Post guarantees delivery times of 2 and 3 business days between major centres in Canada and the USA. But, I have given Canada Post a good rating because they owned up to their guarantee failure after I pointed it out respectfully via phone call, and reimbursed me for the full amount. Thank you!"
"Package from Ottawa to Hamilton.
They told me it will be 6 days and now the say 10 days.
You suck so much, you should be fired en masse starting with the top. Your skills are less than zero.
600 years ago in Inca times their chaskis( meaning post men) delivered mail up to 240km in one day
It takes you 10 days for 500km. You are soo inefficient that you can only function in this country."
"I paid for an express service that was suppose to deliver in 3 days...traveling from Delta B.C. to Kamloops B.C. it was posted on the 4th, it showed it arrived in town on the 7th and it is now the 21st and no parcel. I did the chat, started a ticket and then contacted them by phone. At no time have they contacted me. At this point, they have no information and they need an additional 5 days to investigate. This will certainly be the last time I use Canada post as they cannot do the service they are suppose to be good at... delivering mail. I really feel they need to included in the discussion of do Canadians need to fund these incompetent corporations like the CBC, Air Canada and absolutely Canada Post... its a waste of tax payers money."
"My last few experiences with Canada post was terrible. In both cases I bought their express post and was told it will get destination in three business days. But as soon as I did tracking for one of the packages it showed 11 days from the sent date. Even if I consider two weekend day and one holiday my package should have been delivered with in six days to at most a week. Very deceiving and in my opinion unethical. I was paying extra for a reason.
The websites is very unreliable and so is their customer service. Every info they are providing seemed like they are trying to shed responsibility for anything or circumstances where it should be the opposite. Customer service call are almost useless since any additional information about the situation is unavailable on their side of the interface. Canada post has a long way to come to have quality customer service and keep up with the emerging information driven supply chain industry.
I am definitely going to look for alternative options for my parcel next time on."
"Awful! My wife's parcel was sent to the wrong address, and upon complaining, it seemed they did not care at all, no remorse!"
"(No I will not apologize for the bad grammar, I'm mad. leave me alone.) Sh** service. constant delays and they don't even have enough respect for their customers, to inform them of said delay until after the shipping day has ended. You'd think they'd know if they wouldn't be able to make the delivery the day they said they would. You'd think they'd have enough respect for the people paying to use their services, to say ""Hey, valued customer. Unfortunately, we don't think your package will arrive today. We're sorry for the inconvenience"". But no, they leave us to wait all day for a package that never comes, and then promise it will be delivered another day. For me, it was supposed to be here on the 14th, now it's supposed to be here on the 20th. Not to mention the package shipped on the 6th. 2 weeks of waiting for clothing."
"I was handed a notice card and told to pick up my parcel at a shoppers drug mart... make it make sense? What was the point of paying for delivery? Why are couriers walking around with a stack of notice cards and no packages? I try and dodge CP 100% of the time but even when Im forced to use their service they still don't fail to disappoint. Usually the courier puts the notice in my mailbox but this time I was literally handed a notice card, incredible"
I received a notification that my order was on its way to its final destination then it spent two days going in circles in a city 3 hours away and an entire week got added to my delivery date. When I contacted them my main issue was ignored and nothing got resolved. No excuse that a package from another province can get here faster than one from 3 hours away. Felt the need to update this review. I honestly wish I could give negative stars after government issued mail got forwarded to 9 hours away because the local post office couldn't be bothered to read the address even while they scratched out my address and out a forwarding sticker on my mail so they could send it to my grandfather who died almost two years ago. So instead of getting my mail two weeks ago when it was in my local post office I'm going to have to wait atleast another week to get it. This is not the first time my mail has been forwarded to someone else. There is no excuse for this. Im pissed.
"I live in a building & they didn't bother to put my notice card in the door's mail box, they just dropped in on the floor. Someone kicked the card a few feet away from my door, luckily I got it just in time before it could get lost."
"0 rating!

I had a very bad experience with canada post and will never use canada post ever! A friend of mine from bermuda ask me to send her 2coach slingbags and 2pc coach wallets and so i did! I mailed it to canada post and the lady told me it takes about 8-14weeks to wait. I purchased a 100dollar worth of insurance for that items. Months went by...i mailed it april and until september the items didnt reach the destination yet. I keep calling canada post to take a look of where my package went and they told me they cant locate it anymore! I keep tracking it as well online but i only seen that it was in quebec areas all the time. They declare my package being LOST in october which made me so devastated cuz the amount of that package is around 500cad and i paid that items for my friend hoping my friend to reimburse me later with all the expenses. I was so depressed and hopeless cuz i know the thieves are just inside their offices waiting to find another victims. Its so sad that canada post dont care about how the costumers feel when items is lost and stolen irregardless of how much that maybe. They've been so heartless keep victimizing innocent people."
Do not ship with this garbage company they will lose/steal your packages and claim they are not responsible for there irresponsible employees!! Typical government garbage ship with any company but canada post they are the worse and the worst customer service they wont help u and wont find your package if lost!
"EPIC TRASH SHIIIT
50$ to send a 400gr package to France, and the bIIitch said to me its gonna take 4 weeks....

It cost 1$ in china for up the 1kilos and it takes 2weeks to receive my package.....

CANADA IS EPIC TRASH COUNTRck"
"Canada Post shouldn‚Äôt even get one star. I mailed my permanent residence documents, the address was correct and they got re routed and weren‚Äôt delivered. After a week, I was told they were coming back to me, they didn‚Äôt. I call the help centre, I‚Äôm told they will call me. No one does. I call again and they have taken down a wrong phone number and email. Complete lack of care from everyone I have spoken to. No one wants to help. It is the worst experience I have ever had with a business and it‚Äôs a shame that they can operate like this. Pay the extra and use couriers. I would never trust Canada Post again."
I asked the cashier in canada post I'm sending very important documents and I want proof of signature for my package. Off course the package never arrived to the person I sent but their tracking system shows the package was delivered to the concierge (building manager) and it doesn't show I requested any signature. The building manager claimed he didn't receive any package. I reached out to the post office I sent the package originally and asked them to check their system because I was sure I asked for signature their system shows I did requested signature. I called them back to see why my package never arrived to the person I sent and why they didn't ask for signature. The receptionist on Canada post was very rude and asked me so many unrelated questions. Even I had the service ticket and she had my information she asked me all my info again. Finally she rudely offered me my postage refund! Honestly getting those documents back is going to cost me a lot of money and it's required one year of waiting. I'm so disappointed. She even didn't apologize for my lost. I think for important documents it's so risky to rely on such a poor oriented organization.
"they're alright-acceptable sometimes, but more often than not they are late with deliveries (missing due dates) > BUT this is totally understandable having worked at UPS, I know how crazy it gets during peak season, with the pandemic it was a whole new monster. During the pandemic everything was double as long (Xpresspost 2-3 days took 5-7 days instead, and priority 1-2 days took 4-5 days instead.
I know it is super frustrating but it is not ALWAYS their fault.. mostly due to the upper management - underfunding to employees and overworking (as with most shipping companies), with covid making 3 times worse... The main reason CP sucks is the upper management - they don't allow customer service agents to have enough permissions to actually solve issues from customer service. Nor do they incentivize the employees to actually do their job properly hence the current situation

source: been ordering & shipping frequently the last 4-5 years"
"It is becoming very common for Canada Post not to deliver mail that I've sent out. A buyer of an ebay item to who I mailed out the item on March 15, 2022 has not received the packet yet."
Horrible in every way. Package not arrived. Customer service representative hung up on me (I wasn‚Äôt being rude or anything they literally just hung up on me for absolutely no reason). This is a terrible company and proof why crown corporations shouldn‚Äôt exist.
"No one rang my door bell and I got a notice to go pick up my package I WAS HOME. these people suck.
TERRIBLE!!"
"Canada Post never fails to disappoint. They delivered my package to the wrong building. Numbers and street name were completely different. Like how??? Thankfully the person who had it was honest and I was able to get it back. But when I called back to update, there was absolutely no remorse. Even filing a complaint was difficult and I‚Äôm not even sure anything was done for it to be honest. They clearly don‚Äôt care. When even the federal government doesn‚Äôt trust them to deliver our vaccines and has to use Fedex instead, you know it‚Äôs bad. Avoid at all costs!!!"
"I would rather have an online retailer throw the package to my house, at least then it would arrive faster and less damaged. Seriously, this is by far the worst postal service in the country. No updates on tracking for days, unnecessary holding of small packages in centers, and always, always, always late. Like why do they even bother putting a delivery date on their shipping service if the actual delivery date is nowhere near there. I understand mail can take time, but in today's day and age with Amazon getting things to you in a day, ups and Purolator being both fast and accurate, there is no excuse for this level of crappy service. Often times packages will go in the complete opposite direction of their destination for a few days and put everything way off course. Often times I won't even use an online retailer if their shipping method is Canada Post. I have absolutely nothing good to say about Canada Post no matter how hard I think of something. Waste of time, waste of employees, and a waste of money. I hope with every semblance of my being that the company tanks and goes bankrupt. DONT SHIP WITH CANADA POST, ITS FASTER TO WALK!!!"
"This is a thank you note to two Canada Post employees who did their best to provide a great customer experience and solve the problem of a month long. When I was abroad I sent a parcel to my Canadian address. When this parcel arrived to Canada, it was never delivered to me as the address label was lost. Canada Post simply sent it back. My numerous contacts with Canada Post employees including CS Reps, CS Supervisor, even Director of Investigation, Ombudsman were useless and disappointing until Scott Bain, Manager UMO, Scarborough took it all in his hands. Scott Bain and Richard Ando, Supervisor, Mississauga and his team prevented my parcel from being sent back to the original country. When everyone else said ""we can‚Äôt do anything to stop it from shipping back"", these two men proved the opposite. I believe, if someone would try to do anything about it earlier, it would have been resolved sooner, with less stress and better impression about Canada Post. Thank you, Scott Bain and Richard Ando, for your service. Canada Post customers still have a chance/hope to receive their packages when they deal with someone like you who care about people."
"Outstanding! I just received a package that ics delivery apparently could not. Not only on time but early
CANADA POST SAVED MY DAY!
I have been trying to get my order for 16 days. YES SIXTEEN DAYS! We are fortunate to have Canada Post watching over us
BTW I'm in M4B2G7 and would like to thank the delivery agent for such great service"
Lost what was the most important letter of my life even after paying an extortionate price to have it tracked. You are truly a terrible organization with no remorse for your failings.
"They never even attempt delivery, they don‚Äôt even drive down my street, it‚Äôs always dropped at the post office, a 5 minute drive away"
"The worst mailing service in existence. For some reason they didn't delivery my package because my ""address was wrong"" but I double checked with the sender and DHL (who gave it to Canada post for some reason) both informed me my address was correct. A notice wasn't left on my door and I wasn't contacted to pick up or inform me there was something wrong. I contacted their customer support and they told me that the reason could be ""the packages rub together and sometimes the address is no longer legible""... and proceeded to shift the blame to DHL and the sender. I had to wait 20 days for that shipment and now its being sent back to the sender because they messed up, I can't get my money back for another 20 days and all they can offer is ""thats not our issue anymore you have to contact the sender now..."""
I live in abroad expecting a parcel from Canada Post. They received my parcel on March 4th.. today is March 22... and my parcel is stuck in Richmond (British Columbia). I paid for Xpresspost International. What is your definition of Xpress??? Will my parcel ever arrive?
"Don‚Äôt use the Express of Canada post, you‚Äôd never got what you‚Äôve paid for!
The parcel always delayed and the driver always dropped notices card for pickup only, and then made lies and lies‚Ä¶!!!"
If I could it would be 0 stars they lost my package 2 time and did nothing about it
Im a minor that lives abroad (I‚Äôm 17 turning 18 in a month). I couldn‚Äôt even pick up my parcel‚Ä¶. I just moved here and don‚Äôt know anyone that I could of asked to get it for me. It was a hoodie‚Ä¶ they sent the package back and I couldn‚Äôt even get my item.
"Don‚Äôt use there services, there costumer service is horrible, I order a package within Canada multiple times it‚Äôs suppose to be a couple days shipping not over 7 days to ship a cookie sized box like what the f?"
I recommend never going thru Canada post they delivered my package to a different house and never did anything about it or try to get my package back or give me a refund
It's true!!!!
"Express Mail for a destination within 30 minutes‚Äô drive. 12 days later, the mail is still on the way‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
"Unacceptable and ridiculous service. Just garbage. Do not trust express post to get there on time, charge $15 to apparently get to destination in 3 days, so now its 6 days which is 2 days longer than regular mail. DO NOT SEND ANYTHING IMPORTANT through canada post and always request for your refund. The dude that runs this country should pay more attention to internal services in the country than being too concerned about a war on the other side of the world and sending tax payers money there as well.

Food for thought:
In total, Canada Post has made a net profit of $266 million since 2012. In 2017, the Corporation posted $144 million after tax profit.
Canada Post CEO makes $500,000/year"
I would love to give a better rating but I had to call my post office more than five times in two days with no reply. I finally got in contact with them by calling the drug store they are in and after being on hold for more than 6 minutes the pharmacy employee say I was still on hold and walked over so I could talk to them. They had no updated information about my package and I ended up being told to call the customer service number. The man who picked up my call - shawn - was rude right off the bat. It sounded like he had a very rough night so I was trying to be cheerful and as kind as I could at 8pm after being run around by canada post for two days. He only got more rude and more dismissive. I hate to assume this but I feel like he treated me this way because I am a girl. I had my male partner call next and he got the only good service we have had so far. The man my partner spoke to took him seriously right off the bat and our package was tracked down and delivered to the post office within two hours of him making that call. I wish that I had been heard the first six phone calls I made but I have learned my lesson and will now get men to make my calls to Canada Post since none of the employees I spoke to were willing to talk to me for more than a minute and were nothing but rude and dismissive.
"Quebec - Vancouver. Lost the first package, 2nd took 30 days, 3rd arrived in Van 8 days ago (20days into its journey) and hasn't arrived yet, day 28 now."
"Sincere appreciation of your staff at 8330-82ave, Bonnie Doon
I am pleased to inform Canada Post, my daughter and I are very grateful & appreciative of Ann Marie, manager , and her well trained and dedicated staff at the Bonnie Doon P.O. Ann Marie treats her staff with respect, trains them well, and they all work together as a strong team day in and day out. I have been a long term customer of this postal outlet since 1990. We found your staff are very well trained, loyal, well respected, professional, and of high level of integrity. They are taking pride in the job well done.
Ann Marie, her staff are walking extra miles to provide quality service to all who access the postal service at this location. Thank you. My name is Nellie, Priya Jeevan is my email address name. Canada post has an excellent reputation on an international level, keep it up. Congratulations.

"This is unbelievable. An old country like Canada that has the worst system in world , and the most expensive. How do I have to wait in line for 15 minutes to pick up a package, that is without mentioning the incompetence of the employees .I am using a different service now, less expensive and more efficient."
"Very very disappointing experience. Please choose another service and get your item on time.
My delivery standard date was March 4th and I they failed to deliver it on time. I called the customer service agent and they told me they will look into it for me as I was leaving Canada on March 7th. I received an email saying a service ticket has been issued and I will be updated on March 11.
I called them again and the customer service agent said I cannot track the package. What is the point of tracking number when you cannot track the item.
I am never going to use their service again and advice everyone to do the same, and save your time and money."
A package arriving from the US through amazon arrived way faster then a package coming from the store 30 min away from my house through Canada Post.
"Utterly useless, lost an important package that I paid to have shipped internationally failed to deliver it, fumbled it all across canada and Poland to have it re routed to ""my new address,"" I never updated my address. It's been about 7 months and counting. Would highly recommend using a different courrier to ship anything. Not to mention some cheap knockoff tracking service stays more up to date."
Canada Post is a disaster! 5 weeks to get a small package from Sudbary to Barrie and that was great! Most of the time the mail doesn't arrive at all! I am a small business owner and I have to use couriers due to the fact that our post is worse than that of Venuzela!
My parcel was delivered from Alberta to montreal. It was showing me expected delivery tomorrow and after two-three days its was still showing me delivery tomorrow. Is this any kind of joke . It has a really bad service . My own country is a developing nation but they provide better service in post.
If there is less than one star I would put it. Very bad service. We forwarded our mail last December and until now we are on beginning of March haven‚Äôt had any mail. We lost so many money for this late service. And the guy I was chatting live with him was rude. No help from this Canada post very sad
"Canada Post really needs to do better when it comes to express packages. I know we're all human but there is a reason we PAY for Express...to get things fast, for deadlines, for events etc and sometimes when we miss these deadlines it costs money. Please consider my review üòîüôèüèø"
"apparently getting Canada post to deliver one small package is asking too much. I had a package that was supposed to be delivered to my house. days after the expected delivery date, I was told they were unable to bring it to my address. they then claimed they left a notice for me but I never received one."
"Canada post doesn't even deserve a star! I spent over $140 to send a package Express post which should arrive in 7days,it has been three months and Canada post is giving me wrong information everytime I call. No one person I spoke with is giving me the same information about my package. Even the supervisor are giving me the run around. The only good thing is the supervisor defends their employees. They can listen to the tape calls and still they're no idea what's happening. Use a different company please."
They are a joke tell me package to arrive Monday then might be a day late then wensday might be a day late then Friday might be a day late still no package can't wait for my new message on Monday clowns !!!!
"I am truly disgusted with Canada post.
I ordered a package last month and was told it would be delivered on March 15th 2022, and based on my tracking information, my package is in Missasauga. However, this was posted on March 10th, and it is now March 22nd, so it's been over 10 days. I spoke to an agent at Canada post and they said it would be delivered no later than March 28th.
Canada post is by far the most unprofessional , inadequate delivery company I have ever experienced. I would rather use Purolator, UPS, or DHL, and pay a $20 delivery fee instead of using Canada post. DISGUSTING is all I can say."
"Bad experiences
They don't car if you pay 100 or 1000
They do mistakes and you have to pay .
I had 2 times problem with them .
The last one ,The parsal arrived in Canada and they just returned it back to the sender in Turkey without telling the receiver the problem or why they going to return it back if there is any issue in address they didn't call to resolve it just returned the parsal I call them many time to know why? they just telling me we don't have any information.
I lost $300 US Because of careless people ."
"A Victoria BC Canada Post mail carrier did not deliver my Ebay package and just turned it around Back To Sender. The other mail carrier dropped the packages to the local post office and would leave pick up instruction card at the door. Now, I have the hassle of trying to get Ebay to refund my purchase if my missing order never shows up again."
International packages ! Seriously you should be out of business. For an express post website says 6 business days. It's been a week and it's still in Canada.
"They should be out of business the worst pathetic delivery system ever, Not buying ever from companies that use canada post again ever... they call themselves a post office most pathetic service ever."
"It would be nice if Canada Post policy, at this point in time, didn't simply involve putting it's paying customers last. I live in the North, and continually watch as packages zoom across the country, in order to stall and spend a week or more on the last 2h leg of the delivery. If executing your rural service has no interest to you, then perhaps that should be reflected in the prices customers pay. 2nd or 3rd tier service should not have the same or HIGHER price tag as the service the rest of Canada enjoys."
"In order for employment with Canada Post's mailing sorting, is the obligatory prerequisite still full frontal lobotomies ?????"
I was constantly checking to see if my mail has arrived!! It usually comes around 2 2:30pm so I was kinda confused on why I was still waiting for the delivery at 4:30 pm.. I checked at 4:30pm and for some reason it says it has been delivered at 3:09.. I was constantly checking my tracking order and nothing!!!! I have important items.. I don't want anything to break from the cold weather's we have rn.. soo idk he/she took and extra hour to scan my package when it was already in my mailbox
"On 3 Feb 22 an item that I ordered from Ont. was processed through the Mississauga Maze of Canada Post. On the 4th Feb it began its journey to PEI arriving in Dieppe,NB at 8:38AM 6 Feb 22. As I was expecting a normal delivery on the 7th of Feb the tracking app indicated that my item was shipped back to Mississauga for a second chance of being lost. Tracking also shows that my purchase was once again placed in transit at 6:52AM on 7th of Feb but did not specify as to WHERE! Updates indicated that my item would be delivered on the 9th, then the 12th of Feb. It is now 14 Feb, that is 7 days since it was shipped out of the Maze for the second time and it still has not arrived. Presently updates state that my purchase has been delayed and to stay tuned for more updates. I can only say that Canada Post suffers from negligence, incompetence and stupidity. I am informing all businesses that I now deal with to refrain from using Canada Post."
"Canada Post was supposed to delivery my package of Live Plants which is specifically labeled on the box. You would assume with *maybe* a little bit of common sense that during the winter due to cold weather, you would make it a priority for delivery. Package was in transit for 2 days from Mississauga to Toronto and on a Friday, so now these live plants are sitting in the cold with no sunlight and won‚Äôt be delivered since it is the weekend now. Just a headache and unnecessary stress for no reason due to laziness and lack of care on Canada Posts part."
"I mailed a parcel since January 04, 22 and was told it would arrive at its destination in 18 days. Today is February 12th and Canada Post doesn't even know where my package is!! I cannot understand how a package just falls into a black hole!!Did they have to cross the Bermuda Triangle??? The best part of this is they are now telling me I'll have to wait ANOTHER 30 DAYS for an update!! This is unacceptable!! Is this a postal service?? You have ONE JOB and you cannot get it right!! NOBODY IS HAPPY!! Time to close up shop and do something else!!"
"I had a package shipped from the States. The only way it could come is via USPS and Canada Post.

It was released by customs in MISSISSAUGA on February 4. The estimated delivery date remained ""unavailable"" until the 10th, when it showed that it would be delivered on the 11th. Why such a long delay?

Their app nagged me to create an account so I could manage delivery options. I created the account, and I chose to have it delivered to my door instead of the community mailbox... because... why not? They gave me the option, and I PAID for it to be delivered.

On the 11th, I got a notification to say it had been delivered to the community mailbox.

I trudge down there in the rain, and find a key in my box. The key DOES NOT WORK!

I called them, and they told me it will take three business days (its a Friday now, so it will be five) to resolve (if they aren't too busy), despite the fact that the carrier will be visiting the box on MONDAY. Why can't he take my package out and just deliver it to me? That would involve customer service.

""If you could drop the key back into the box it would make it easier for us"". Oh would it? I'm here to make things easier for them am I?

I told them they can pick the key up at my house, where I requested the package be delivered in the first place.

They don't give a cuff about customers. There is a reason I stopped using them long ago. Ita nice to know some things don't change."
"It seems there's a VERY good reason why CP don't let you email them directly anymore (Looked around they only do telephone and social media lmao, time to take it to the streets!)... Too many totally reasonable complaints to ignore! Wheres the no star button? I mean, I know to be a mailman you must not really care about education but is it too much to ask to do your job properly? The particular genius who delivered (OR DIDNT DELIVER) my package not only didn't get his fat butt out of his car, I opened the door and made eye contact and he just sat there like a stupid troll! To my amazement not only did he not knock (I closed the door cuz its february), he didn't even leave the tag on the door telling me where and when to pick it up.... I guess its my fault for believing canada post could do their job un-forgettably... Why should I have to suffer at the hands of these naives? Please just vanquish this heinous government vestige and replace it with people who have brains in their heads? Mabye make it so they have to get some education or something IDK... But all I DO know is canada post is a terrible (dis)orginization of window licking cuckholds hellbent on bringing everyone else down to their cretinous level of shameful customer service and customer relations. Please tell the ombudsmoron that hes a tw*t for ME."
"I have an etsy shop. I ship the same padded envelope with the same weight for each transaction. I don't understand how it is $18 for a small padded envelope to BC when it costs $10 to ship to Ireland. Ireland! Also, $8 to ship to California. Please for the love to god explain to me why it is more than double to ship to the USA on the same coast line and almost double to ship within my own country than to another country separated by an ocean."
"Worst shipping company out there, don't no why anyone even uses them anymore."
Been waiting for a package for over a month and today they were supposed to deliver it but instead they delivery a notice paper in the mailbox saying to pick it up at the nearest P.O. They could‚Äôve easily put the package inside the mailbox
Been waiting already for a package from Vancouver to Victoria for 6 days. It apparently arrived and was processed in Victoria yesterday morning (Tuesday) but they‚Äôre not delivering it until Thursday according to the tracking. Probably would have been faster to hop on the ferry to Van and get it myself.
"I really only use Canada Post for mail forwarding service. Every single year I go to renew it‚Äôs nothing but problems with their website. Every. Single. Time.
For the last 7 years I have needed this service so my tenants don‚Äôt have to deal with my mail but it is a major hassle every time. Their website is worse than their delivery services."
"What I don't understand is how a large package is ""lost"" and never seen again? How is that even possible to accidentally misplace a box that large?? I have a feeling that stuff is being stolen, and wonder if employees can see that a package is valuable by the amount it is insured for? I obviously don't know for sure, but it makes me wonder how that has happened twice since Dec 9th. To be fair the second time it happened it was a much smaller parcel.


I ordered a package from BC (I'm in Ontario) and it was shipped by the business on the 26th. It took roughly 24 hours just to leave the facility in Richmond. Since that day the package was never scanned again. So from Jan 27th until Feb 8th it has just vanished and cannot be located. That was Xpresspost. I still have not received my refund. The time before this happened it was a winter jacket ($689 regular price). Thankfully I ordered through Amazon and I was refunded almost immediately. Not sure how things are lost and just never seen again. If it is an honest mistake, where are these packages going? Handheld scanners have been around forever. So if the package is Undelivered and just laying around their warehouse or whatever, why couldn't someone walk around with a scanner and get these packages on track?

The reason I get so upset is that Canada Post is funded by us taxpayers. It's not right."
Why do these people ask for postal codes when their couriers are too dunce cap to use it ? I even did a ticket to fix a package that was 1 letter off and it was sent back to me . The postal code was correct all they had to do was put it in .these people can't read and they were ok strike for a raise they don't deserve üò§ my package was even handled by a supervisor in calgary before it was sent back to Ontario for the second time. I hate you people . Charging me for your own stupidity I just sent it back for the 3rd time
By far one of the consistently worst shipping experiences of all time. They do not care. They are not helpful. They are overall terrible. Avoid using canada post if at all possible.
"Absolutely terrible. For the second time in the last 3 weeks they have delivered my package but to a different mailbox. After calling, emailing and doing everything I can to let them know about the incidents they do not respond after a few number of emails. They have literally ghosted me. Not cool. So unimpressed, have lost over a few hundred dollars."
"Canada post lost my package and realizing it 2 weeks after and then telling me it's not here , no help what so ever , always contact this person oh contact someone else . They don't know what they are doing and very unprofessional, use UPS not Canada post they are amateurs and can't help you when needed . Over all useless"
"Do not waste your money on mail forwarding. most mail is being send back to the sender. Important mail is being lost, causing a lot of problems, be warned. My investment account has been frozen, because I apparently moved. I got no t4 slips. A real nightmare."
"Been waiting for a package for a month, juss got an email from the sender it was sent back because I moved apparently? I‚Äôve been waiting a month for a package to be delivered in Canada! You guys are lazy and terrible!"
"they simply don't deliver stuff,
I think they better close down the Canada Post, let other private companies do the job. so awful"
My package from the UK lost in the post again. Cmon CP you must do better as our nations Mail service
"This area of postal deliveries is pathetic i was told a parcel notification card was put in my mailbox which was NOT... enquired and told the person took the notification card and my parcel back to the depot.spent 2 hrs on the phone and the website assistant and MIRACULOUSLY the delivery notice was in my mailbox...up to this point there was NO DELIVERY OR CARD IN MY MAILBOX,and i demanded they bring my parcel as this is WHAT WAS PAYED FOR!!!!...this corporation is pathetic and probably will not last too much longer as ""who needs a mailman"" these days of online etc.....this pc of crap did not initially put a norification card or deliver my parcel until i spent 2 hrs looking to what happened...FIRE the lazy ""fu:k....useless canada post over paid employee!!!!!"
Just don‚Äôt ....jus don‚Äôt do it . Use any method other than Canada post . Pay the guy up the road a lil more to walk the package across Canada . That dude would arrive a week soon than ‚Äúxpresspost ‚Äú
I am still waiting for an update on my parcel. Its been 1 month and not even the customer service knows where it is. They don't even know where the package is and nobody wants to answer anything. I dont know whom to ask as no one has any answer. A gift sent to special ones i think they have lost it thats why no ones is answering. Still no reply every time a new date now 4th feb as if they will miraculously send it to the destination. The intention of love is lost in this process and this is canada posts express service. Worst service ever. 1 month it was in canada and now its in australian post customs. Thank you so much for the express delivery.
Canada post does it again. Not only was it delivered 3 days late. The postman never even tried to deliver it. I‚Äôm a building manager at a 131 unit apartment building so IM AROUND. No contact was attempted nor did he even leave a card to let me know it was here or when and where to pick it up. Had to use online tracking to know it was delivered. Had to call Canada post. Find the ticket number and can‚Äôt pick it up for another 2 days. Paid to have it delivered. Not retrieve it myself or have it delivered to the closest post office with no notification. Canada post is just useless and there postmen even lazier. What a complete joke and waste of time and money. Worst company I have ever dealt with.
"Why the hell does it take so long to deliver a package! Like seriously! Packages have been sitting in a city 30 mins away from me for 5 days and now magically they‚Äôre delayed and they won‚Äôt give a reason why. I literally got a package via UPS shipped from California to Ontario and received in one day. They just blame it on COVID. No, they‚Äôre just disorganized and lazy. Get your s**t together Canada Post!!!!"
Paid 15 $ to have a envelope delivered 4 klms‚Ä¶ was told two day delivery‚Ä¶. A week later still not delivered and lost envelope .. the depot I mailed from sent me on a wild goose chase contacting their other two depot‚Äôs this should have been their job !!! Finally someone agreed to get back to me ‚Ä¶ they never did ‚Ä¶. Crappy service ‚Ä¶ uncaring‚Ä¶ lazy ‚Ä¶. Disorganized‚Ä¶
"This is a culmination of a lifetime of Canada Post disappointments. Packages lost, ""attempted delivery"" while I have been home all day and no such attempts were made, zero ownership taken on bad business. Just pathetic, I hope you go the way of the taxi service and a Postal Uber comes in and wipes you out."
"Always crazy slow, charge lots of money and ZERO responsibility! Use many excuses"
Paid 16 dollars for express post Port Hope to Waterloo. It's been a week and it is still not there. Regular mail is quicker. It's just a letter for God's sake. Should have used FedEx.
"I've never had a bad experience with CP; its appears that only negative reviews are posted here! In 28 years using them as a recipient, and as a small business customer, never lost a single item, nor has tracking failed me.
So much better than my experience with PostNZ and Spring (both of whom have lost high value packages)."
For once in my life I wished I lived in the United States so I wouldn't have to deal with Canada Post and their BS. The ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!! They lost a $140 package of mine that had a proper address and proper tracking number!!! Every single bad delivery experience I've had has been because of Canada Post.
"Horrible customer service
Unprofessional people
Lost my items worth almost 250$ twice and they did not do anything for me
Stupid way to waste people‚Äôs time
They don‚Äôt know what they are doing"
"The most Atrocious postal service I've ever seen
Truly one of a kind!"
"Wish I could give zero stars...or minus any stars they have.

They don't deliver parcels anymore, you have to go pick them up. A delivery service that doesn't deliver."
"I had my passport delivered through express post should only take 2 days but took almost 5days. Then I called customer service, Khushi involved her supervisor and tried to solve my problem, he reached out to Jannice and said Jannice would give me a call from the distribution office but instead someone else called me and was very rude told me wont go through thousand pakages for me. Then I went to the office in downtown where a clerk came back after talking to Jannice and said that driver Cody would deliver it end of day today, but no one showed up. Then again tried calling again got a super helpful guy on the phone but seems like no one wanted to work on the ground level. It was such an important document and needed asap. He told me there is nothing that can be done. Then he got hold of Brenda such a nice lady with lot of experience and empathy for her customers. She found my package within an hour and called me when and where I can go and pick it up. Then I went there and rewarded her for doing her job right. Thank you so much Brenda you were such a great help. Others should learn how to work from her."
"I ordered an item from AliExpress and was very unfortunate that they used Canada-Post to deliver the order. Canada Post marked the order as ""delivered to mailbox"", when I checked the mailbox it was empty. I waited a couple of days as it was the holidays and I thought it was just delayed. I then called the customer service and submitted a compliant. Canada Post never responded are held accountable for the loss of the package. AliExpress refused to contact Canada Post or to give a refund, they asked for a proof that it was not delivered. How can I prove it when Canada Post says it is delivered !!!
I gave AliExpress the ticket number, but they still refused to contact them or give a refund.
And this is how I lost the order and the money."
Once again Canada Post has succeeded in not delivering a small package or making any attempt at contact. I pay for delivery to my door. CP gets away with ripping off customers because they are never held accountable. It doesn't matter how many unfavorable reviews there are CP simply doesn't care. They are a monopoly. I won't continue to order from any website that uses Canada Post and by extension Purolator. üò°
"I had to order the same package for my mothers christmas gift twice. Both times the sender used Canada Post and both times Canada Post lost the package and took zero responsibility. I am not upset with any of the customer service workers I spoke to, they were both very kind and understanding. However, Canada Posts delivery system is flawed and disorganized. I am so incredibly disappointed that I have actually started to check what delivery company a sender uses before ordering because I never want to have to use Canada Post again. I am out 200 dollars because this company has lost my packages. I have sent BOTH claims to the sender and hopefully they can get me my money back. So hard to support small businesses when big delivery services mess up the delivery constantly and force me to take money right out of their pocket again. Do better."
I am still trying to find out what happened to my package I sent from Oregon to Edmonton Alberta full of home made knitted Christmas items for my family. Besides taking a month to finally get an attempt delivery. Even though they left a noticed for the package to be picked up at a Shoppers Drug Mart near by. The package is no where to be found. Am still waiting the result if their investigation! Not happy with them right now.
Canada Post has got to be the worst carrier in the country. CP has let someone go from our tiny post office Dec 31st. Yet since this date mail and packages have been sporadic and now it has been closed for the last 3 days. I am expecting three very important packages as a small business owner and CP couldn't care less. I have written Mr. Doug Ettinger CEO and not even a response. Get with it CP and have someone work at the post office. It isn't rocket science ! CP doesn't mind charging us small business owners high outrageous ship prices but their delivery stinks.
Paid for xpress shipping and still very late as usual. Use another postal service if possible. Employees are borderline rude and your not worth their time.
"I dont get how you pay for express shipping, 2-3 day delivery. A week and a half later the parcel shows up. They must not read the reviews or just dont care. They should just get rid of Canada Post all together. The only thing they seam to deliver these days are junk mail and late packages. Tighten up Canada post, You suck."
"For the past few weeks I get notifications that my parcel will be delivered by the end of the day. But the next day comes and goes. I order a lot online, and always shutter when I see it is being delivered by Canada post. I have now told several suppliers, that I will not order if they use Canada post. Crazy to think businesses are losing customers due to the horrible service provided by Canada post"
My friend shipped package on January 7 and left surrey January 10. Package arrived Winnipeg on January 14 and it‚Äôs January 20. Package is not still delivered. Worst shipping service
F Canada Post I paid $20 for expresspost for a $10 item and its 7 days still not here. They should all be fired.
"Paid Priority for 2 day delivery, 4 days before Christmas. It took 6 business days (10 in total) to get from Vancouver to Kelowna by air. Opened a Ticket to complain and requested the $45 be refunded. Ticket was opened and closed and I wasn't contacted at all. I will never use Canada post for anything time sensitive or valuable again.
Trian Matei."
"Can we just rid ourselves of this useless tax drain on Canadians and let the pros at UPS or FedEx do the job? Canada Post has picked up an envelope for me 168 KM from my house. 14 days ago. Three times I‚Äôve had ‚Äúdelivery expected by end of day‚Äù statuses, and three times it‚Äôs been delayed.
168 KM, 14 days and counting. Week 3 starts tomorrow. Well done."
"Worst customer service and the slowest delivery service ever, they keep delaying people's packages because their workers are lazy and overpaid."
"Kindly please take incharge of the shipping. I have so many unhappy customers who are blaming me for not being good at my own business however, you guys are being pain in the a**. I shipped stuff with express and pay more to get my shipment on time at least delivered. I see my orders are stuck God knows where. Please do not be such a disappointment as we rely on canada post and you guys need to do better.

Please please"
"On Dec. 24th I mailed an important letter through Xpresspost to our tax center on P.E.I. , as private couriers won't deliver to a P.O. box.... it was a check... one letter, the cost was $27.32 for thier express post service... which claim ""next-day and 2-day domestic shipping"".
I can understand a few extra days delay with the holiday season, but... Confirmation of delivery, which I checked on twice a day, was finally, end of the day, January 7th...
....it took them 15 DAYS...
Not only did Canada Post deceive me with thier 2-day shipping claim as they took my $27.32 but my tax payment was late. Now ""I"" will be the one penalized for thier failure in service.
My fault for trusting thier advertised claims... any mode of transportation would be faster..."
"What kind of country don't have mail delivery service, CANADA! I can understand there's omicron situation, but before that, it was already very irregular, I called Canada post many times, and was given many promises, but no mails since xmas 2021. I give up, F that, this country is not worth it, even third world country can have their mails delivered, lol."
"Thank you for spoiling my Christmas Canada post. You are a moronic organization . 999 times out of 1000 packages are sensibly left in my lobby, then every now and then you tell me it's normal for you to take my packages back to the post office. No I am not chasing you, get a life you stupid stupid organization. I really hope the government dissolves Canada post."
"I had a friend send me a package from Vancouver, I live in Alberta. It went from Vancouver to Montreal, and then to Kelowna, and back to Vancouver, and that's currently where it is. When I called to ask what the heck - they said the package originated in Montreal. I explained that it came from my friend in Vancouver and they said no it came from Montreal. Some how they changed the origin and tried to mislead me. Then they hung up on me when I inquired about getting my postage fees back, as the expresspost service is a three day delivery standard- and it's been nine days currently, and it's now exactly where it was sent from. This is not the first time they have messed up so badly, or the second or third. The entire company is a disgrace and needs to be abolished and the workers fired. It's disgusting how awful they are."
"Canada post is the worst package delivery service available. I have used them 50+ times, to which they only deliver on their standards approx half that. The biggest waste of time is the ""ticket"". You call someone at CP that takes your info, and gives the same brush off answer -wait. The packages are basically lost until they show up or don't. Nobody can give real answers or find out how a package delivered to a locked mail slot is magically not there. No accountability, no real concern about a person who is obviously pocketing stuff. Waited 1 month for a item which was late and then kept by the delivery woman. Great I'll get a refund 10 days from now to reorder at a new much higher-price and then wait 2- 4 weeks again. I suggest you avoid CP like covid."
"Horrible company where the very bare minimum definition of their job is a huge exhausting task for them. They will deliver your package to the wrong address, blame you, and say theres nothing they can do. How they are still in business is a mystery to me."
"China can get a parcel to Canada, from ordering to delivery, in five days. Canada Post cannot even budge that parcel from one point in Canada to another in a week.

They do not deliver parcels, they deliver ""sorry we missed you"" cards and will not even make an attempt.

I am so happy when Amazon and Intelcom are handling a delivery entirely themselves, because if it ships from Canada, it is always next day or day after delivery. The clowns at CP cannot do that."
"This canada post lady was very agressive towards me and was talking to me loudly and did not have her mouth mask on, and she was upset that i was doing her job for her and what i mean by all the junk mail she keep shoving, i cleaned it up, and the package was my neighbour she damaged it and put it by the garbage can in the mail room, i texted my neighbour letting them know there pckage is down stairs and wanted me to bring it up to them, and the lady was still argueing with me not allowing me to leave, and they say canadians are nice xD not all are especially this lady she looks like in her 40's and im 24 years old, i even told her if i was in her shoes i would do a better job and i explain to her meaning of it is by removing junk mail and if the package cant fit in there mail box i would of put it in the canada post big box thing or bring it to the supernatant office, but the lady said she did not see like come on lady be human and clean up after your mess and stop leaving the mail room open aswell, and horrible canada post people i came by in Hamilton Ontario was a lady with blonde hair long false eyelashes and she have blue eyes and she was not skinny nor big she was lean."
"This is the third time I have had this happen. Went to our community mailbox to pick up a small package. The package was wedged in so tight I could not remove it. The mailman would have inserted the package from the top, when the lid was open, but even then it would have to be forced into the box. All he had to do was place it in the parcel locker and leave the key. Once again I had to take my pocket knife and cut up the box in order to remove it.
grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!"
"I have never experienced such disappointing service in my life. Canada Post seems to be extremely slow. I sent a small packet from Canada to London, England, which cost me $74.88 and was told it would take 17 Business days to arrive! It was mailed on October 27th, 2021 and it is now January 25th, 2022 and the parcel is nowhere to be found. Just because I didn't pay the extra $30 for a tracking option, so I have no way of ever knowing what happened to my package. This is totally unacceptable! Any Business would have to be accountable, but Canada Post just washes their hands! They have no problem taking your money, even if it never gets delivered. Shameful!"
"Canada post is by far the worst shipping service.I always receive those notes that‚Äôs say that they attempted to deliver the package and I always believed I just missed the delivery somehow, but now due to Covid I‚Äôm off work and at home.I‚Äôve spent two days waiting on a package the first day the delivery was rescheduled after hours of waiting waiting which is fine, but today I patiently waited at home for my package only to receive a notification of attempted delivery!!! No attempt was made whatsoever to deliver this package. Horrible horrible service continuously by Canada post."
"Terrible service! I paid $15 for express shipping and deliver to my door. The package is the size of A shoe box and doesn‚Äôt need signature. We have a community box at our building. I was home all day waiting for my package to arrive. I got nothing except for delivery noticed and saying that I have to pick it up at the nearest location the next day. I just got out of Achilles surgery and I‚Äôm under medication. The package is Cryo Cuff (I need it‚Äôs for my Achilles to get the swelling down). I called Canada post and explained the situation and their response is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use Canada Post, use other carriers if your not happy‚Äù and I was forced to drive and pick up my package. Wow üëçüèæ. I called customer service twice trying to complain but they just put me on hold for 20-30 mins and no response."
"December 2021, I ordered an item online that was unfortunately going to be delivered by Canada Post. I say unfortunately because Canada Post is very proficient in losing packages which they did with this one. After the Delivery standard date for Expedited Parcels (available from tracking) had passed, I called Canada Post to ask where my parcel was. They couldn‚Äôt tell me. Just another blunder from Canada Post trying to be a parcel delivery service. I contacted the company who confirmed the item was given to Canada Post to be shipped and that they were treating it as another Canada Post item lost in transit. They assured me that if I re-ordered they would be using a different delivery service. Unfortunately the item is still out of stock."
My package was never delivered and they say they cant do anything about it. Ruined my holidays and will try to never use their services again.
"Always late my package has been in Winnipeg for 6 days can't deliver it I guess
The reason I gave you 1 star is because there is no zero"
"Can I leave a -5 star review please?
I always prepare my mind for frustration whenever Canada post is to deliver my items . And they never disappoint!

I ordered a bottle of Paula‚Äôs choice as usual and they could not leave it at my doorstep?!

I have to go somewhere to pick it up the day after a delivery notice was left at my door step

This doesn‚Äôt make any sense

And this has happened repeatedly

One time , I went to pick up the item the day after and I was told I came too early at 3pm ."
"Found out my packaged delivered today and ran to the office arrived at 4:59pm, walked in and the lady behind the counter who was servicing someone just yelled out it was 5pm and she was closed. Very rude. She could have spoken to me in a polite manner. The package was my daughter's winter coat that I had expressed down from my brother's hometown whixh she left behind. It is calling for -17 tonight and the lady couldn't even find out what I needed. If she was closed the door should have been locked. I walked in before 5pm and was yelled at. So ignorant."
"Worst courier service ever! Every and I mean every courier service other than Canada post delivers my parcel to the door, but you guys cannot because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo heavy‚Äù or ‚Äúwon‚Äôt fit in our mail slot so come pick it up‚Äù that‚Äôs some bs! This company should not be allowed to take parcels that do not get delivered to your door, it‚Äôs a scam I pay to have the package delivered to my door not to go pick it up at some remote location and saying you made a ‚Äúdelivery attempt‚Äù is an outright lie! You don‚Äôt even have the package when you guys deliver you just drop a note in a box and say ‚ÄúA delivery attempt was made come pick it up at our remote location‚Äù. No delivery attempt was made I was home no one knocked on my door no nothing! No other courier service has issues with delivering to the front door so why can‚Äôt you? Even if it is too flipping heavy that‚Äôs what a god damn dolly is for! Not even worth a flipping 1star review! #DOBETTER!"
Service is so terrible it's actually a joke. Delayed my package 4 times in two weeks.
"Making fake delivery attempts and leaving ""pickup card"". Happened many times for me. I order to save time on going to store but now I have to go to post office instead üëç"
"uncovering a scam to take packages at Canada Post today. Someone or a ring of people at the Post change the postal code in processing, which makes the recipient unable to file a claim, the sender must. It sends the recipient on a useless hunt because the package is long gone as it can now be routed anywhere they want. Times are tough, but wow... just letting criminals take advantage of hard times"
"Very disappointed in the level of trust I now have for Canada Post (not in my regular delivery person... Happened to be on vacation when my ever happened). $1000 order was determined to be delivered IT WAS NOT! After many calls to the tracking department they began to investigate. They determined the truck through GPS tracking was parked away from apartment and verified it was not delivered. The case worker had promised to call back with a final status, but did not. So they closed the case without further communication. Integrity is lacking.

By the way...Amazon with their many delivery workers have never missed a delivery. Fourth one bite from Canada Post as well the tenants before me also have had their parcels not delivered by Canada Post.

You need to do better!"
I do not like their service at all .I already waited fory parcel from 15 days and its not showing me any update and telling me the exact date or time or anything about my parcel . I don't know where will i receive my parcel n even after calling their customer service they only provides the information which is showing me online even and they don't even support you to make a quick delivery . My parcel supposed to come yesterday which is my last expected delivery date but now it is not showing anything . And even they dont provide u any phone number after many try i get their customer care number .
Amazon gave me a return label using Canada Post and Canada Post won't take it because package it too large. üòÇüòÇ. Marg is the worst to use. Ms. No personality.
Sent a Christmas card December 1st. the name and street city and postal code were all correct..forgot the unit number. A good post would have recognised the name and posted it in their box. BUT NO...it was sent back to me. I added the unit number and reposted the card...it was again sent back this time with a question mark by the unit number. Everything was correct...The postie didn't even try to deliver the card. So disappointed.
"Terrible service! Terrible human being!

I stayed home all day just to wait for my order. They went INSIDE of my building, left the delivery notice card and go!! JUST TERIBLE!"
"One star from almost 5000 people says enough. Time for a change at this dinosaur company..

Horrible in every way. One of the worst companies out there. They say safety I say lazy. Give these guys any reason to delay or not deliver and they pounce. Horrible customer service and they know it. Don‚Äôt believe me, use them and you will‚Ä¶.."
"I ordered expensive items from a large distributor in New York. They were shipped the same day.
The package shipped via DHL. Five days later, it arrived in Richmond BC. That's when the problems began -- when Canada Post got their hands on it. It stayed there for 12 days! It's now been stuck in Victoria for another 4 days.
As a (former) believer that essential services should be in public hands, I now think Canada Post should be privatized. It no longer works.
None of their excuses -- weather, COVID, volume -- hold water. DHS got the package across the US in 5 days and, in the meantime, I've received packages via other couriers ordered well after the one that's ""disappeared"" into the Canada Post disaster.
This kind of failure has become the ""new normal"" with Canada Post."
"I'll be honest, I usually don't have problems with Canada Post. But occasionally it's a total headache and it's been getting worse in recent months. Right now they are holding a package of mine in a warehouse in my city for 4 business days according to my tracking for no apparent reason. It was ready to be put on the truck Thursday morning, now it's saying it will be Tuesday by the time it gets delivered. You know what else? They delivered a separate package to me yesterday (Thursday)! I'm just confused. There were no issues with my other package, besides the fact it took a week and a half when it usually (even a couple of months ago) takes two days to show up on my doorstep. Why is my other package sitting in a warehouse?"
"Firstly, I work for a large courier company. I'm well aware of the internal workings of one after 13 years. They all operate almost identically... EXCEPT Canada Post.

I have a prescription that was coming in. I left notes on both doors saying ""please knock, I'm home"". The nonservice provider (can't call them a service provider because they certainly didn't provide a service) doesn't knock and just leaves a tag. I go to pick it up, find out it MIGHT be there after 5pm or 100% on Monday. Apparently it's due to covid and people might not be wearing a mask when they come to the door. Again, every other courier company (large ones) provide their employees with a mask and hand sanitizer soooooo do your employees also not go grocery shopping? Do they only go to and from work? Give me a break. You messed up and didn't want to admit fault.

I explain I'm out of the medication that was SUPPOSED to be delivered. I'm still told it will only likely be there after 1700 and I can't meet up with the driver.

I can't tell you, how many times, with a bigger company than Canada Post, that I've gone and met someone because they needed that product today. I'm sure, if I was a large company, my voice would be heard a little bit more. Either the entire company is poorly run OR just the centre in Moncton, NB. What poor excuse for a business."
"Yet another package ""re routed possible processing error"" w. T. F. ! Every single time I use Canada Post this crap happens. How does amazon ma age to get my packages here in a day. Never again."
The wooorrsst....my package with no signature required...is tied up with Canada post....did not even attempt a delivery....a notice was said to be left????every one was home!!??not left in the more than accommodating mail box???called n got worse customer service...told nothing they can do ..n ill have to wait to pick up the next day.i should not be picking it up ..lazy ..lazy people work for canada post ....they suc large!
They are complaining each year about the facts they dont make money. They never realise they are useless AF. They cant even deliver SQDC packages anymore cause they dont want to take care of signatures. Whjat a bunch of lazy ducks. Government crappyness at its best.
The best example of how government funded businesses pail in comparison to the private sector. A business this incompetent could never survive not being propped up by government.
"Your service was perfect, fast delivery to the mailing box etc, until lately
Many many parcels required me to go and pick them up from your office, and I don't know why you couldn't deliver them! You had me paying for taxis way more than what I would've paid for delivery! Also when I use Canada post to send something, I pay for xpress shipping, and I end up getting it arriving later than the standard one! Then why would I pay for xpress if the standard shipping will arrive first? Fraud"
"They let my package sit in their warehouse (100km from destination) for 3 weeks then finally moved it to my city, where its been sitting for over a week while they refuse to put it on a truck and just deliver it. They wasted so much time, I literally moved. They refused to reroute the package to my new address, they refused to deliver it and refused to let me pick it up. How is this not withholding mail?"
horrible service pay for 2 to 3 day shipping always late it always takes 8 or 9 day just a scam you pay more and get the same service what a joke f canada post
I got caught in an email transfer scam and was happy to see the package returned before it was delivered thanks to the supervisor and dedicated staff at good ole Canada Post!
"Reviews speak for itself. If you are a supplier, avoid using Canada post otherwise you will lose customers. There are better options out there."
"Very bad customer service that they are not able to resolve the issue even if the receiver is calling them again and again to change the shipping address. Because, there was a wrong address mentioned by the seller from where i bought something. This is ridiculously wrong that they can deliver the item at wrong address without knowing the person who will receive it and keep it and won‚Äôt tell them about the truth. This is totally non sense. It is not even out for delivery from my town‚Äôs warehouse, as i can see in the tracking page"
They leave your package where it can go missing and when dealing with them they give excuse after excuse..They don't deal with the customer properly when asking for what happened to their package
"Called 4 different offices which none of them picked up until I called one of them repeatedly. I asked if I could just pick up my package given it's been delayed multiple times and has been in the city im in for multiple days, and instead of giving me an answer for that she just said my package will be shipped to me today or tomorrow so I thought that's fair enough. Another 2 days go by so I called again and said I want to pick up my package if their not going to be able to ship it to me and the women said the same thing as the previous person did, the package will be shipped today, and I cannot pick up my package and hung up on me. My parcel still hasn't been delivered and it's more frustrating that they won't let me retrieve it myself especially when I have a deadline as to when I need it in my possession that they have not met. Based off my experience this is a very poor service they have and I hope I never need to use them again in the future."
"i ordered an item from bestbuy and they ship through canada post. my street name was missing from my shipping and i called to have it fixed and the representative who picked up told me that they could deliever it to me using my postal code and street number, 2 hours later my package was sent back to a nearby bestbuy warehouse and now it will take another week to arrive instead of the given date that they provide. Sad to say 0 stars isnt an option because that is the deserved option they should get."
"My registered mail was received at the post office on November 26, 2021 and I was told that it was expected to be delivered in 3-7 business days. Now more than one month has passed, it's still not delivered, and the status is still ""expected to be delivered in 3-7 business days"". The Customer Service rep told me yesterday that no further information would be available until January 6, 2022! I wonder if my mail will ever be delivered at all."
"Delays, delays, delays. Same old BS. Wish companies would just stop using them in general. I realize its the Christmas season and Covid and all the other excuses but no other shipping company even compares to how bad Canada post is. Avoid them at all costs they have no interest in getting your packages where they're supposed to go. The reviews speak for themselves."
"My letter took 8-ish business days to arrive to its destination (cross-province), but given the fact that I sent it a week before Christmas, I'm happy that it arrived at all and within a pretty reasonable time frame :')"
"I am so sick of Canada post. I literally will not buy anything online anymore if its going by Canada post. They either need to hire more people or fix their system. Don‚Äôt have holiday cut off times if they can‚Äôt even come close to it. Don't offer faster shipping if you upgrade to xpresspost or priority if you can‚Äôt even come close to being ‚Äúfaster‚Äù. Offer automatic refunds maybe, that would be a good start. What was the point in me paying for extra fast shipping when it was slower then the regular shipping. Then my item keeps getting delayed or re routed in my city. Like just let me pick it up. What a joke. Lots of people having similar issues. Canada post needs to be upfront and not scam their customers into paying extra shipping to guarantee items will be here for the holiday. They knew the items would never come in time. SCAM"
"I would give a minus 10,000,000 stars if I could. Paid for Xpresspost. Haven‚Äôt had an update in 5 days now and when I called to see where my 1-2 day delevery package was‚Ä¶ well they don‚Äôt know! My package has priceless gear inside and they sent it farther away from where it‚Äôs supposed to be going- and really actually don‚Äôt know where my package is at all. I put in for a service ticket and they said they will get back to me by January 10- unreal!!!! the package was sent December 21! Absolutely horrible service. Have never seen such ridiculous behaviour from a postal service that all people should be able to trust. So dissatisfied."
Vancouver -Kelowna EXPRESS.... 17 days ! WAY to go snailmail...
"What can be said that hasn‚Äôt been said below in the thousands of reviews below?

Nothing.

They are horrible. The absolute worst service and least accountable workers on the face of the earth."
XpressPost a package from Vancouver to Victoria (Vancouver Island) has taken almost 2 weeks. XpressPost guarantees 1-3 business days within province. What a joke of a company
Have a tracking number for a parcel I have been waiting on. Last and only update was Dec 12 for a shipping label was created. It was Expedited too. Been tracking parcel daily and to my surprise update was delivery for Dec 16. No parcel arrived. Tracked parcel again - stated Dec 20th delivery reason missed the cut off. No parcel arrived on the 20th. Now says Delayed stay tuned for updates. No updates only shows Dec 12th when label was created. I called customer service - they only shows the Dec 12th. Rep reassured me that Canada Post has the parcel. If Canada Post does have the parcel then why is there no updates when I track the parcel. Isn't that why you have a tracking number to track your parcel? The website is very vague and frustrating when there's no updates to show where the parcel is. Other couriers have a much better tracking system which shows where the parcel is once it has been scanned. Canada Post tracking does not provide any updates when a parcel has been scanned at any of their distribution centers or is it just my parcel? Why give a tracking number if you can't track the item? They say track your item on their website but when there's no update they surely don't believe in customer service. With today's technology you think Canada Post would have the tracking system as other leading couriers. Canada Post needs to evaluate their website for tracking. Customer service is a key nowadays which they are lagging behind their leading competitors.
"Delivery from Ont to BC took 2 days to arrive in Richmond BC. It has been 12 business days to organize delivery 3 1/2 hours to Vicroria. Calls have had replies of ""oh Covid"" and road blockages. Covid has been active for 2 years and is not going away and road blockages are are not between Richmond and Vancouver Island."
"We have had several problems with Canada Post deliveries this Christmas Season. The latest is so frustrating. I ordered a Christmas gift on Nov.29. It was coming from China. Tracking shows it cleared customs and CP picked it up Dec. 12. Last tracking showed it in Richmond BC on Dec. 14. Since then there has been no updates. I don't know if it's still in BC or where it is. Any private courier would be out of business with this type of service. I could outline the other 4 issues, but what's the use."
No difference between regular mail and express mail. So I advise you to pay for regular delivery since paying for express does not make any difference. Very poor customer service
"I was supposed to have a package delivered to me on the 20th of December. The package showed up on time, but the person responsible for making the delivery did not even bother attempting to hand me the parcel ‚Äî they neither knocked nor rang my doorbell nor called me.

I know this because I work from home.

Instead, they left an 'attempted delivery' notice on my mailbox directing me to a post office nearly twenty minutes from me. Said post office does not have the parcel. It has been 'returned to a processing facility.'

No one informed me of this ‚Äî I had to find that out myself.

I have been given the runaround by their customer service agents for two straight days now. No one knows where the parcel is. No one knows why it was rerouted.

All I've been given is the vague assurance that they have 'launched an internal investigation' and 'a supervisor will be in contact.' Oh, and a facetious excuse about 'worker safety' in the face of the pandemic. Because apparently, they want us all to forget that this issue has nothing to do with the coronavirus ‚Äî this happened frequently well before anyone even knew what COVID was.

Supply chain issues with packages from BC are one thing. I understand that entirely. But this?

Do yourself a favor ‚Äî the next time you need a parcel delivered, use UPS or Fedex."
These people do the best they can with what they have allotted to them. They are a service not a business and should be viewed as such. Sometimes the service isn't great but often it is very fast which indicates there are probably good reasons for delays. On the whole a decent org.
"This is the worst, they didn‚Äôt explain what happened with my package, I did thousands of tickets and nothing changed. I wish they took their work more seriously, for them it‚Äôs just a package more but for us it‚Äôs important,"
"CANADA POST STOLE MY PACKAGE. I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but I haven‚Äôt received a package even though it says delivered. When I talked to Canada post about it they told me they would investigate and if I didn‚Äôt get my package in 3 days I was supposed to contact the sender. I expressed my concern about the possibility of an employee have stolen my package and Canada post said ‚Äúno it does not mean an employee took it‚Äù so I asked again ‚Äúwell what does it mean then? Because I checked security cameras and know it wasn‚Äôt anybody from the building‚Äù ‚Äúit means we couldn‚Äôt locate your package. You have to contact the sender‚Äù
And neither the sender was able to enlighten me in this. Out of all things, being kept in the dark about this is the worst. At this point I‚Äôm not mad that I didn‚Äôt get my stuff I‚Äôm mad no one is telling me what happened. Wish someone cared enough about their business but clearly they don‚Äôt"
in just the past six weeks Canada post has lost 3 parcel two coming from Quebec to new Brunswick. and the 3rd was coming from port Perry Ontario to new Brunswick. the three parcel was coming from Ontario the even sing the parcel out of a warehouse and then they say they have not received it yet. DON.T USE CANADA POST IF AT ALL IS POSSIBLE
"Honestly I have nothing against a lot of the employees they are usually super helpful from the customer service side of things. However, delivery and logistics are terrible. I've had dealt with everything from packages getting delivered to the wrong address to consistently late deliveries. I have never received a package on time, and the bulk of parcels get carded rather than a delivery attempt. Jokes on the delivery guy as I work from home and see them never make the attempt. The other issue I have is they have recently marked my mailbox as dangerous. At one point it was tilted by 10 degrees so I had to level it. Not it is 7cm below the height they want it at but is actually above the minimum height according to their policy. I can't fix the mailbox to their height has it is currently frozen to the ground because of snow."
Today 3 different employees from 3 different canada post locations helped me with finding a package that was lost. We appreciate their time and effort which was a few hours on the phone. A big Thanks to Tina for the final great news. Happy Holidays!
Slowest service even if you pay for fastest mail price it will still take more than a week to deliver your mail
"Ordered an item from a shipping location approx. 20 mins from my door. A month has now passed and it is still not delivered. Tracking is useless and never updated. Multiple service tickets have been opened, but not resolved. ""Investigations"" seem to consist of waiting around for a week and hoping something will turn up.

Information from customer service depends on who you speak to: some say it is lost, some say it is still waiting to be delivered, some will not give any information. All of them say they will do nothing and my only option is to work it out with the sender, although the sender is blameless.

This will change the way I purchase as I will do what I can to avoid using Canada Post again."
"They'll show up to your door without a package in hand and leave a ""missed-you"" note. They'll pick up your package from the same city you live in, transit it across the entire province (sometimes even outside the province) only for it to arrive late weeks later with no explanation as to why it ever should have left the origin city in the first place, I can't think of a more terribly inefficient way to ship anything. Canada Post is just a slow archiac company that hasn't been able to adapt to the times. Avoid shipping or receiving through them at all costs."
"Purchased an item from a retailer in Ontario. It was shipped Expedited. CP picked it up on Nov. 26th (the first and only scan). Weather-related advisory popped up and the first promised delivery date (Dec. 3) passed to be replaced with a new date, Dec. 6th. That date passed too with no delivery. Tracking has been telling me since Dec. 7th that delivery is delayed and to check back for updates. It's now Dec. 17th, and the only thing that updates is each subsequent day (Dec. 8, Dec. 9, Dec. 10...). Virtual assistant is useless. ""Live Chat"" is only able to give you information that you already know. The seller of the item received the same information from CP that I already knew. Big waste of time. And I could be out a great deal of money. Oh, a friend received his purchase from a different Ontario retailer within a week. Delivered by UPS. (Update). My package arrived on a Sunday afternoon at 3:50 PM, more than 2 weeks late, but it arrived and I'm relieved and happier. Thank goodness."
"WHY? When tracking it says - ""Expected delivery: Today"" yet it will takes days or even weeks to get the package. It reaches Canada in 3 to 4 days from other part of the world but within my own country there's always a huge delay. NO, the holiday season isn't the reason as this is happening since before. Hating Canada Post services with all these delays especially after spending extra money to get something expediated and still there's no guarantee and lies after tracking the packages."
"Embarrassed and ticked off this is a Crown corporation. Zero accountability, Useless complaints system, some (all in my experience) delivery people are lazy and don't deliver parcels as they should and just leave tickets so you can go pick it up ( why am i getting it delivered in the first place? because i need it delivered cannot transport it myself). All in all please please please please use another service company if can UPS, FEDEX Canada post needs to be choked of revenue so the government does something drastic with the Post and its union."
"Honestly pretty much everyone I deal with is rude there at all times and they have zero customer service skills. It's christmas and I understand they are busy like many business during christmas but they are so un accommodating, I'll be going out of my way to not use them in the future."
Worse service ever. I run a business and I have had to deal with angry customer due to delayed delivery. Alternatively I also ship to the US and they are not this inefficient. The only issue I have ever faced is if it's under Canada post. What a badly handled company and what a shame that we are having to use this service.
Missed my flight back home because as well. Had to call off work for an entire week. I paid for express shipping and my passport still hasn‚Äôt arrived. If you need to get something urgent please use a courier. They charge you for fast deliver but give you very vague unsympathetic responses when you ask them where your package is and why it hasn‚Äôt been delivered.
"CANADA IS THE WORST. Worst service ever. I could beat myself for using them. Why offer Xpress when u know you can't meet that standard? I don't even understand the reason for the delay (neither do the CSR) because there is no adverse weather condition in ON. To make matters worse, it's my passport and I don't know where it is."
"Terrible . .just the worst. XpressPost paid for with a guaranteed delivery date and nothing shows up. The CSR states ""sorry sir, it just happens""....wow"
"Again, Canada Post failed. Horrible service, tons of delays; unable to assist. Order in Nov. still stuck in Richmond BC, without any updates since Dec 3. Every other courier service is able to get around the flooding in BC; with minor delays.... Canada Post... NOPE. Not doing anything."
"We get it, the BC highways are closed out of Vancouver. There are shipping delays. So when I order a product from Montreal, explain to me why it goes Montreal, Calgaray, RICHMOND, BC interior. Why don't you try NOT driving packages that don't need to be in floodzones into floodzones and getting them stuck there indefinitely. After a month, you'd think you'd modify your process. Unbelievable."
Worst shipping company just close it. My package got delayed twice now it say they will deliver it on December 9 and until now december 14 say it was delivered by the end of the day and I didn‚Äôt get any package. And also what is the sense of paying the express delivery that will get delayed by how many days this shipping company is scam don‚Äôt use it anymore. F you Canada post what a scam shipping company
"Canada Post is the worst service ever for postal services. I've had so many poor experiences over the years that it's hard to stick to just 1. The worst example was about 4 years ago... I had ordered 2 items at the same time from 2 different sellers and through 2 different delivery methods. 1 parcel was coming from Hong Kong (literally the other side of the planet!), and the other was coming from BC through Canada Post. The package from Hong Kong was regular delivery (the express fees were just way too high), and the Canada Post was supposed to come Xpress Post (3 day delivery). I got the international package 3 weeks after it was ordered (actually slightly ahead of the expected delivery date), but the package from BC took over 2 months to arrive! When I called Canada Post repeatedly over the situation I kept getting BS answers and excuses for the delay, and was ultimately told that there was ""nothing they could do""... worse yet I was told that if I wanted a refund on my shipping costs I would have to contact the seller/shipper as they had no responsibility to me to refund my shipping costs. How is it that the seller is even remotely responsible when he shipped as promised and when I paid the cost (it was on the receipt as part of my purchase costs)?! Canada Post has done this and other things too many times to count and needs to be completely disbanded!!!"
"Yet they love to go on strike for more money, but yet the steal money from children's birthday cards like its part of the job. I've order skateboard bearings and they sat in the sorting warehouse down the road from me for 3 weeks. By time I got them, skate season was over. Hell, I can't tell you how many times I've waited for them near the door for them to give me a package I've waited on that was supposed to be delivered a week ago, for them to just walk up to the door without the package, and just leave one of those notes. I've caught them doing this once, then called the guy out, buddy didn't even have the package, he just wrote up the notice. Then when they do leave package at your door, they just leave it at your front door without even knocking. How my friends ps4 was stolen, have it on camera from his doorbell. He even went after canada post about it and they said it wasn't their problem because ""he wasn't home,"" when he has proof he was in his living room the entire time. F canada post. I'd much rather just pick up my stuff at the sorting facility because how dumb they are, but cant do that. Lol"
"Third time they don‚Äôt even attempt delivery and force me to go to a depot and do their job for them.
I get there, lady takes bar code from email, can‚Äôt find parcel, tells me to come back because she is ‚Äòtoo busy‚Äô. I tell her that I was here first and I would like her to do her job, parcel miraculously appears a few minutes later..
Gotta love unionized environments. From now on I simply will not shop with any online stores that use Canada post."
"Since Amazon prime uses Canada post now, my shipping times went from 2 days to 5 weeks. Everything I ordered in November is still not here and now I got my recent delivery date, after Christmas. Thanks Canada post for the worst delivery service, year after year you always disappoint and your never held accountable for your terrible service that we the tax payer subsidizes."
I wouldn't give any stars to this service. Parcels mailed on December 4th are still in the Richmond sorting station. I'm fed up with the excuses for delays. Next year I won't use Canada Post.
7 weeks waiting. No updates. I just wish I could be this useless and still have a job.
"What more can I say. All the one star reviews are dead on. And why any seller on Amazon would use them is beyond me! Amazon should make not using Canada Post a requirement if a seller wants to use their site!! Waiting for an item bought on Amazon as a Prime Member and Canada Post has changed the delivery date 4 times. I think my item is sitting somewhere in Winnipeg as far as I can tell and its been 2 weeks since my order!! It is too bad there is not a zero star...better still a few negative stars.
* This is one of many negative experiences with Canada Post."
"Terrible service! I don‚Äôt even know why they are a carrier of choice. I had a Xmas party dress that was literally coming from Australia and safely made it to Canada. At the last leg of it, my dress was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to my community mail box. But‚Ä¶ of course Canada post has to mess up and leave no key or placed they key in the wrong mail box. I called CP and they say the same crap to contact the sender. So much for paying taxes eh"
"Canada Post wins the a-h of the year award.
My friend printed a label from Germany for a package I had to send him. I brought a package to a Canada Post office, they printed the label, and I left it with them to send.
Next thing I know, Purolator knocks at my door returning the package. NO REASON GIVEN, NO notifications from Canada Post.
Just an enormous waste of everyone‚Äôs time and money.
Still no idea why they returned it."
"Avoid using Canada Post plain and simply. Their support is absolutely useless other than repeating what is already on their tracking system and they won't try give you any other information than that. Basically you are at their mercy and abandon all hope of expecting the delivery the next day even to one of their post offices. Their support is blatantly apathetic.

Currently my package arrived in my city I've been waiting a week and counting for it be delivered to the nearest post office. If I knew where it was I could drive 15 minutes to pick it up. It's now a month since I ordered the product to be delivered by them."
I will not use this service for express post again. I was expecting 2 of my parcels would of been delivered by now when I payed the extra cost. Mailed on Dec 7 one is still in Mississauga and one on route to Sault Ste. Marie. do not pay the extra cost. I hope both parcel fo make it the expected day is Monday which is to late from my expectations. I do not want excuses that its busy for parcels. I paid for the express so I expect that service
"Awful, awful shipping company. I never receive my stuff on time and I had a couple ones that got lost as well. I don't understand how companies still use it when there are better, faster, and more reliable ones."
"You'd think they'd have the common sense to reroute their packages shipped from Eastern Canada to the Calgary or Edmonton sort facilities for customers living in the BC Interior when the roads in BC are closed because of a natural disaster but the morons have now shipped several orders to the ""PACIFIC PROCESSING CENTRE, BC"" which is in Vancouver. They sent a truck through a closed road but yet can't ship my package back through to Kelowna and now my package is delayed indefinitely and I have no idea when I'll be getting my essential work items. I'll definitely no longer be shopping from retailers that only allow Canada post as an option. International deliveries are also a joke, how is it that a package can get through a very corrupt postal system like Russian Post and across a whole ocean in less than 3 days but Canada post takes more than a week just to get it across Canada? This experience happened 3 times during the normal season."
"Canada post is the absolute worst delivery service on the face of the earth. Id rather cut one of my fingers off every time i order something than have those brainless scumbags at canada post delivering my mail. You can add at least a week to any bull jive ‚Äúexpected delivery date‚Äù they give you. A flake of snow hits the ground and these soft losers won‚Äôt step foot outside. There is no wonder why canada post has all bad reviews, because they are terrible. All across canada this company sucks, its pathetic. They do whatever they can to screw over the customers, they handle every situation terribly wrong. Just a pathetic company, worthless scum. If you work for canada post, you are a pathetic loser and your company is worthless, quit."
"I'm sorry-- this isn't to target the reps. at Canada Post but what I'm quite upset about is their system I think.
I was given a little slip (It mentioned that the pick up would be ready after 1:00pm the next day with the location on where it would be at). So I went the next day at 3:00pm or so, and was told to come back since my package wasn't going to arrive until 6:00pm.
I was upset that I drove all the way there, but I understood. So I went back at around 7:30pm and was then told that my package was at a different Canada Post.
The rep apologized for the inconvenience. It wasn't their fault but I'm quite upset that there was no communication regarding the relocation of package.
I just hope this doesn't happen to anyone else--I just wasted gas."
Canada mail delivery often goes to wrong mail boxes.
"I had an order ship out from Montreal, QC on Nov. 23rd, and it's been sitting in the Richmond, BC warehouse since the 30th. The package has now been held there for longer than it took to travel across the country. I'd have been okay if the shipment from Montreal to BC took longer due to the floods, but there is no excuse for it to be so delayed when it's only a 20 minute drive from the warehouse to my place (and we have no floods at all in this area). At some point it's no longer acceptable to use the weather to cover up the company's incompetence.

Even worse, the delivery status is consistently unreliable. They don't update the status until the very end of the day, when it's clear that the package is not going to arrive at the estimated time. This is the second time that they've had to update the expected delivery date as well, which probably still won't be accurate.

Contrast this with orders from the States which I placed AFTER this one, but those packages have already been delivered by UPS days ago!! In fact, all of those orders arrived earlier than expected. Canada Post can't relate. Seriously, this is the worst postal service I've ever had the displeasure of using. Retailers need to go with better options!"
"I live in an apartment. I received the ""Out for delivery"" at 1:21 pm. So I waited for two hours in the mailbox area of my apartment. At 3 pm, I received the ""Notice is left"". Today postment is not even try to deliver parcel to your house? They will just deliver ""Notice Card""? As of 3p.m., no ""Notice Card"" in my mailbox!

Contacted Hotline, ""if you leave in a condo with common entrance, we will leave a delivery notice card (DNC) that directs you to a local post office for pick up. "" and I will received your notice card during regular mail delivery time."
I‚Äôm so sick of Canada post not even trying to deliver a package. I swear they write up the all delivery notice cards before they start their day and don‚Äôt even bother seeing if your home then drop off all the packages at your near by Canada post drop off center. I‚Äôll be home all day and not get a call that they are here to deliver my package. But somehow they get into the building without ringing my buzzer. Plus we have Canada post boxes in our apt to put packages in even if you‚Äôre not home. Still don‚Äôt know how to use those either I guess. So I‚Äôll go down to the lobby to get my Amazon packages that are left on the table downstairs and see a delivery notice card from Canada post telling me I have to go and pick up my package. What‚Äôs the point of this type of delivery system. You‚Äôre missing the whole point. Distributors still using Canada post are gonna lose customers if you keep using this garbage postal company.
Can Amazon Canada please take over Canada Post? How is the postal service this bad??? I have 3 packages that were supposed to be delivered this week that are still sitting in Limbo. They can‚Äôt keep blaming Covid for their incompetence. They‚Äôre so bad that they won‚Äôt even take your calls to see where a package might be and have no good reason for not delivering it‚Ä¶.
Made a purchase online and the seller sent it 'Expedited' delivery with Canada Post. 12 days later and still not arrived. The seller is 2.5 hours from my home. Pathetic level of service.
"I really don't understand why this company doesn't get a complete over haul of every aspect of their operations. It took them a week to deliver something to me from a town that is a half hour away whereas I got a shipment from New York to Alberta in 3 days!!!!!! Stuff will sit at their originating postal facility for 4 - 5 days before it even ships during regular times so I hope everyone sent in their Christmas gifts at the beginning of November! One of Canada's worst companies by far, they never take responsibility for anything and seem to enjoy screwing people over while taking their money. They need new people running things like NOW."
"Almost every time I experience delays, and terrible customer service."
"I had some very important document to mail from Sherwood Park AB to Parksville BC. The post person suggested I use Priority Post. Fast, safe , secure. Sent on November 30 2021. It is now December 05, 2021. Documents are still in transit. Checked tracking. They are now supposed to arrive at destination Monday December 06 2021.
Is Canada Post not aware of air planes. What a waste of money.
Al Vaughan"
"Trust Canada Post to use the recent tragic outcomes in BC due to the torrential rain we've had to try to hide their incompetence. I've had a package sitting at their Richmond, BC depot since Nov.23 undelivered supposedly due to this; today is December 5th! It would seem Canada Post somehow has to go WAY OUT to the affected areas before coming back to Port Moody, BC which is within the Lower Mainland? No, it's not the weather, Canada Post, it's you that's the obstacle! Pure Incompetence!"
"The package was 2 days late instead of a Wednesdays it was delivered on a Friday. It was delivered to some random dingy variety store, who is going to hold on to it for the weekend. Instead of somewhere I can actually pick it up like the Rexall that my packages usually are delivered to. Canada Post is increasingly becoming a nuisance to deal with and I realize today that your service has become obsolete."
"Useless service, go in with 0 expectations or be disappointed."
"Canada post Is the worst place to have your item mail through the shipping time and service is very poor and the customer service is worst.
They accept no responsibility for there mistake and everyday error example there package always get re-routed dut to processing error which result in length delay and no compensation and when you call customer service the make excuse and nothing change always a disappointment and long wait"
"They do not guarantee delivery time. Forget about this service if you have something time sensitive. Once your package is in their hands it can be 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or 4 days until it reaches the destination. You will also see tremendously BAD decision making in ROUTING the packages. The package will arrive at a hub close to your destination, then the package will moved the next day to a hub further away. There is no way for the customer to intervene in this mess and just pick himself the package from the hub. My latest example a package from Ottawa to Toronto send with ExpressPost took 4 days to deliver (the service is supposed to be 1 day delivery!!!). And the package was time sensitive for me. QUESTION: What delivery service in 2021 CANNOT GUARANTEE DELIVERY TIME? ANSWER: CANADA POST"
"If you're reading this, you know exactly what's up.
It's impressive to have such a mediocre service like this in 2021."
"Worst Customer Service ever.
Repeatedly deliver late and driver lies about trying delivery. I am home every time and my buzzer is never called. Repeated complaints about this get nowhere and employees on phone or help desk make poor excuses for the driver not doing his job."
"Very very bad service. Really disappointed.
Please dont trust them, your items are not gonna get delivered even after one month of your expected delivery.
Worst service ever."
"I had posted a prior review on how slow packages are once they get into Canada. I just talked to the postman that delivers in my neighborhood don't get me wrong he's wonderful and is delivering the mail that is given to him. No issue there, the issue is far higher up the chain of command and the Canadian border services agency, packages sit there for weeks and in my case multiple months before they're even processed and are released to Canada post for delivery. It's absolutely Ludacris!!! covid, Christmas or not. My logic on it is hi influx of packages hi influx of employees... SIMPLE!!! The rest of the world, China post,USPS,DHL,UPS, FEDEX etc, Are going full steam ahead once again it's undeniably frustrating ü§Ø????"
They accept parcels for delivery and then leave a card in your mailbox telling you to go the next day to shoppers drug mart and pick it up yourself. If they cannot deliver to your door like any other shipper then they should stop accepting parcels. Worst service ever.
"The most useless, infuriating big-name delivery company ever.

Ordered a phone case because my current case is breaking down and can't get out often (plus holidays make it difficult to find a case now). Ordered online, had it delivered to my home which has a community box (so I have my dedicated mail box, and a parcel box).

Get a notification this morning from the Shop App saying ""out for delivery"" by Canada Post at 11am. Stayed awake all day waiting for them to drop it off, call me or deliver it to my door even. Nothing, no updates on anything all day. At this point, I've been awake for well over 36 hours (almost 48). 8pm rolls around, I get a notification ""delivered"". I checked my mail box, and I get a SLIP saying ""unable to deliver, sent to [location that's 3KM away], requires ID"". Requires ID? I never asked for that, and it's a phone case, not a computer or expensive artwork.

I pull up chat, and they basically in summary say ""There's nothing we can do, the sender requested ID, sorry for the inconvenience, [copy/paste responses]"" after arguing on why or how they can ask for an ID for a PHONE CASE that's no bigger than 7in in size that could very easily fit in either my mail box or the parcel box. They end the conversation basically saying ""you need to go to the sender for further information"".

I go to the site I bought it from, gave them the order#, and they tell me word for word:
""We don't request ID for parcels but if a parcel is taken to the post office, they do require ID to pickup any parcel""

""Yes, we don't request ID for parcels on delivery only sometimes a signature. As this has been taken to the Post Office, Canada Post are requesting an ID to pick up the parcel""

I'm in shock. This agent told me that they never even requested a signature from me. So I contact Canada Post again, after they lied to me the first time, and they had the audacity to lie AGAIN. I tell them I talked to the shipper and told them what they said (copied and pasted directly from the chatlog). I explained that they never requested ID or a signature, I never requested ID or a signature, Canada Post had full possibility of placing such a small parcel in the mail box or parcel box but refused because ""ID was required"" so I asked them flat out ""So again, who is exactly asking for a signature/ID?""

""Those service request are made by the sender""
""I understand your frustration but it is the information that I have in my system. What I can do for you is open a complaint on the situation do you wish for me to do so?""

They lied not once, not twice, but MULTIPLE times! On top of that, they tried to shut me up by saying they'll send off a complaint? Really? They're now forcing me to walk halfway across my city because THEY refused to do their jobs, because if I don't get the package within 15 days (which I don't get paid for 3 weeks, and they knew this because I told them this), they'll send back my package. It's ridiculous! Canada Post put a damn ""ID required"" flag on my package for LITERALLY NO REASON, tried pinning the blame on the SHIPPER, lied to my face about it multiple times and is now forcing me to do THEIR job by walking 40 minutes one way, and 40 minutes back to get my PHONE CASE (that again, could very VERY easily fit in a mailbox).

Lazy sacks of sh t. That's what they are."
I met a post lady named Rebecca Brown. I don't think I have met a more down to earth and understanding mailman/Woman in my life! I wanted Canada post to know that her good spirit goes along way. Take good care of that lady! She deserves to be noticed for her work and social edicate! Great Job Rebecca Brown from Saskatoon!
"I recently ordered two packages; one from the States, one from Italy. The one from the States contained four mosaic tools. The one from Italy contained over 100 lbs. of Smalti Glass. I've got the one from Italy, sent by ship, then UPS in Canada, by ship people. I am still waiting for the tools sent through USPS & Canada Post. In fact, wondering how bad Toronto's depot is, considering it takes a week to be cleared through customs, and at least that long to be loaded on a plane to its destination by Canada Post. P.S. It's cheaper and faster to order from Italy then it is to trust North American Govt. Postal Services, They can't really justify taking longer than a cargo ship traveling across an ocean now can they! From now on, I refuse to order anything from Companies who use USPS or Canada Post for shipping!"
Canada post is the worst company to have something shipped with! I have ordered 10 different items and 9 out of 10 were delivered within a week from other companies. The 10th item got sent with Canada post and has been 3 weeks and still no tracking updates! They instantly state that your package has been delayed! Terrible service!!!
"I ordered my item online and paid an additional $10.95 for expedited shipping... NEVER AGAIN~! It's the seller's choice to use Canada Post, not mine and in the past, I received my items ok but this time, it's really pissed me off, especially as I had paid extra to receive my item sooner.

Here's the timeline:
15 Nov: Item ordered and paid for online
16 Nov: Electronic information submitted by shipper
17 Nov: Shipment picked up by Canada Post @3.17pm in Calgary
17 Nov: Item processed @7.05pm in Calgary
19 Nov: Item processed @7.20am in Fort McMurray
19 Nov: Item out for delivery @10.40am
19 Nov: Delivery delayed to next business day @3.42pm
22 Nov: NOTHING~! No information, no update
23 Nov: STILL NOTHING~! No information, no update

Called 1-866-607-6301 to see if they could at least give me some update but the staff said she couldn't see any more info re: my item any more than what I could see. I asked why it was delayed, even tho it was already 'out for delivery' and she told me probably due to the events in BC... WHAT? My item was shipped from Calgary with destination in Fort McMurray... all within AB... so where's the logic in that??? I asked if she could at least tell me where my item was located so I could pick it up myself but she couldn't tell me and said it was always moving, possibly from 1 delivery truck to another... WHY? if it's on the move, then why not move toward its final destination? Didn't want to take my frustrations out on her.

24 Nov: STILL NOTHING~! No information, no update

So now, my item is in limbo somewhere and I'm not even given the option to pick it up. The inefficiency of Canada Post is beyond words. If I receive my item by this week, I may edit this review... but until then...

Edit (25 Nov):
Finally received an update @2.34pm today... saying that my parcel was delivered... 6 days later."
"They say that the delivery was attempted, yet this is untrue as I stayed home and was hearing if anyone knocked at the door. Instead of delivering the document to a CLSC (a health organization from the government) where I had sent the document, they would have left a delivery notice in the mailbox of this organization!! after that, they did the same to me - left a delivery notice on my mailbox without actually attempting the delivery, and was expecting me to go and pick up the document at a location where I was unable to go. Therefore, the document was lost. Customer service offered zero help and when I asked for a solution, the person at the call center hung up the phone. All they seem to do now is to leave delivery notices. Very difficult experience."
Worst company to do business with. False promises never delivered on time and useless customer support service.
Nothing good to say here. They lie about general shipment times and I have never in 32 years of being alive had a good experience with Canada post. They leave valuable items at my door without a safe drop area. They FAIL to deliver all of my packages to me within the set amount of time. Year after year they have notices up for various reasons telling you to expect delays to your shipment. They have a monopoly and we pay taxes for this service and then pay to use the service. How long until the Canadian government gives up and let's private company's make a profit rather then Canada post be in debt year after year.
"They never take ownership of their mistakes and always point the finger back at the customer.

Their guarantees are never guaranteed if you read the find print it says that they can accidentally re-route the parcel , lose it, send it late etc and it will be your fault, no refunds.

Talking to their customer service is the worst experience, the lack of ownership, blame on you and inability to refund is a big waste of tiem."
horrible. very late. the tracking has not been updated in over a week. customer service is a horrible mess.
Absolutely pathetic company. You must need a maximum of 2 brain cells to work there this is absolutely ridiculous
"It‚Äôs always something with Canada post. Losing packages, lying about delivery attempts, ridiculously long wait times, or they‚Äôll have your package in a mail truck for days without being able to pick it up yourself. Their tracking will also say ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù for days and then when you see the next update hoping your package got delivered, and it says ‚Äúin transit to post office‚Äù. Ridiculous service I wish I could give 0 stars. Canada needs a better postal service because Canada post has been compete **** for years. I‚Äôm saying all this without mentioning the employees that are rude 90% of the time so clearly Canada post can‚Äôt even properly treat their own workers"
Lose your packages and don't even cover the cost of the parcel!
Worst post office. Slow not reliable and useless customer service. Do not even know what they are doing.
"Canada post said delivery attempt was made and no one was home. This is a lie as I was home all day waiting for this parcel and they also stated that a delivery notice was left at my address again this was a outright lie. Then the parcel which was 35 lbs. Was delivered to a Shoppers Drug Mart for pickup. This Shoppers drug mart is in a big shopping mall with many stairs to climb. Not an easy task to get this parcel to my car. I have to wonder if this is a new way for Canada Post to save some money.
(extremely poor service)"
Package was picked up 3 weeks ago. It only had to go 4 hrs away to be delivered. Ended up in another province. And I cannot get an update as to where it is. There hasn't been a scan on it in 11 days. Nobody to talk to the tracking system is total b‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ sh/$. The chat option on the website is just a generic recording basically. CANADA POST SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!! ZERO SERVICE!
"canada post lies about delivery attempt. Seems as canada post personal cannot read or write english.
I worry that canada post cannot deliver a simple letter or package. I want the service I pay for. Do canada post workers read and write english? How these people , canada post, escape any reasonable level of service?"
"They do not deliver packages. They simply leave pick up location cards on your door and leave. They don't knock, buzz or call. This is clearly a problem because it is consistent and the reason is obvious. I had 2 packages arrive at the same time. One from Canada post and the other form an independent courier that pay their people by the package for delivery. The courier saw the Canada Post person put the sticker on as he was walking in the door to deliver my package. He told me that the Canada Post guy just put on the sticker and left.
Canada post, you're a government agency and clearly living up to the reputation. You people get paid very well and have excellent benefits. Show some damn initiative and stop being so lazy."
Canada post is so bad I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out if I can give zero stars instead of one.
"Just awful, their estimated delivery times are bogus and made up. International orders sit with Canada post longer than the country they are shipped from. Just an absolutely atrocious shipping company. But like all things in Canada our postal services are mediocre at best."
Canada post is worst to send packages. I am owner of a business that sends 20+ packages a day. They just throw out our packages without even telling us. Then you appeal for a $360 package and they decide to maybe give you $58. It‚Äôs a a joke and we are currently shopping around for a new business to deal with.
"The chat app online works well, but that's about all. It's always such a fecal matter show when dealing with canadapost. Very good way to test your patience."
"The website is unusable. Looking for support about missing package and it loops you to instructions on filling a ticket with intelligence 360. But won't provide a link... after 3 hours of searching I don't think this intelligence 360 even exists.

I have 2 packages labeled ""delivered to front door"" same time and date my security camra shows post person delivering only a single package.

I have no idea how to get help from them about this issue."
Absolute garbage how dumb are you to think you don‚Äôt have my adress been in missasauga for a month and finally in Vancouver and now it‚Äôs been a week and a bit more and still haven‚Äôt got it
"I'd give CP 0 stars if I could. I've had a package that's been at the Mississauga post office since October 19th. To this day I still have no updates or anything. I opened up a ticket & they just closed it a week later. This is ridiculous. I get its getting close to the holidays but it said it was supposed to be delivered the 21st of October ....now it says it's been delayed ever since. An update would be nice, cause at this point I don't think I'll ever get it."
"The worst delivery service that i've ever seen. Didn't even knock on the door with my package and instantly left a note telling me to pick up my package at the nearest shoppers the next day when I was at home the whole time. Went to the shoppers at the time that the notice gave me and my package was not there either. The fact that they couldn't just leave my package at the door, because what I wasn't there to receive it? They don't give an estimated time of when the delivery to occur. Do they expect me to sit at the door every moment of the day waiting for the package. They can't even leave a less than 50$ package at the front door and now I have to go out of my way to pick it up when I expected it to be delivered and left at my door step."
"The customer service is null !
They promised me to reimburse me my fees but it never happened ! :("
"Do not pay for XpressPost. Supposed to be delivered locally in 2 business days but .... wait .... if it's not (and in my last 4 experiences, it never is) please wait 2 weeks before the SENDER can open a claim and possibly get their shipping charges back. So the RECEIVER (in this case me) is just S*&T out of luck.
Worse, their customer service folks are under the impression that the service they are [falsely] offering is reasonable. No recourse except wait and hope. No reputable courier could get away with this and stay in business. STOP giving Canada Post your money and use any other courier."
DO NOT PAY FOR XPRESSPOST!!!!! Mailed something Xpresspost in Moncton NB going to Magog QC. Was guaranteed 2 day delivery. That was on November 4. It is now November 15 and we are still waiting for it. CANADA POST = FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. Called their center and they were completely useless as they could not tell me where the envelope was. USELESS SERVICE + USELESS HELP CENTER. Never again will I use XpressPost.
"Sent my daughter a present a gift card and birthday card and cannabis
It took a month for her to receive her damaged gift
They tore open the package she only received the gift card but it didn't work
They said if it smells like cannabis they remove it
Thieves
Never again with canada thief post"
"If I could give 1/8 of a star I would ! Ordered a small rubber auto part that was supposed to be here October 19 it is over a month later . Tracking number says it‚Äôs in Canada in destination warehouse?? Canada post sight says ‚Äúitem delayed‚Äù What does that even mean ?? Delayed why ? They can tell me that as they say they didn‚Äôt have that information available to them? Then why have a tracking service if it doesn‚Äôt work ???
Omg this sis stopping me from driving my car !! They suck !!!"
"The costumer services Are NOT helpful at all!!!!
Why is that‚Äôs They call costumer service if they can‚Äôt help you.
The Staff in post office here at least try to find solutions for my packages.
So regretting calling and wasting my timeüò°"
"I had a lot of errands to run today and Canada Post is one of the stops. It was closed. It is in the service industry so why do they close on Sundays and public holidays? While other establishments are open - grocery stores, airlines, buses, hospitals, fire stations, etc., Canada Post considers itself privileged to enjoy down time. Its existence is to serve the public, albeit its horrible service even when opened. Now I have to waste my time with make one more trip to them. Terrible!"
"Package is over a week late. I understand due to Covid but yesterday morning at 4am it arrived in my city‚Äôs sorting centre and said it was going to be delivered yesterday, woke up today and it says delayed check back later? I‚Äôm getting frustrated"
"I need my package on Friday, it comes on Wednesday, I get notified too late to go pick it up, it is closed Thursday because of remembrance day???!! And I leave too early to go pick it up on Friday. MAKE YOUR HOURS LONGER!"
"Just because they are the only mail service does not make you god! Own up to your huge fail in the mail service industry!
I just shake my head!
It‚Äôs like watching a soccer match.. the player get a slap and they drop to the ground crying!
That‚Äôs Canada üá®üá¶ post!
Wouldn‚Äôt deliver cause of a bit of construction!
Funny they walk in snow!!
They wouldn‚Äôt even set up a gang box at the end of our street! I already pay for this service.. I need find a way to get to another post office some 1/2 away!
Um no!
My time is also valuable!
I will be invoicing you for my time!
Worse service I‚Äôve ever had to deal with!
Three thumbs down üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
You suck!"
I‚Äôm sick and tired of the ultra slow delivery of packages. I order online a lot and the courier companies have to problem but Canada post is horseshit.
"Canada post driver DID NOT read the address properly. They put down that my package was ""delivered to recipient's front door"" and it clearly wasn't. My mother in law works from home, and she did not here a doorbell, or knock and did not see a package at the front door. We ended up walking to the neighbors and saw that it was put on this small ledge meters away from the front door, where it was getting wet in the rain. So even though that was not my home.. the driver still did not ""deliver to recipients front door"". The driver needs to properly read the address' on the box to make sure things like this do not happen."
"Was supposed to get parcel from Poshmark. Did not receive it, but Canada Post marked as delivered to the mailroom. First of all I live in a house with obviously no mailroom, secondly they said they delivered it on Saturday. They don't deliver Saturday. Try and explain this to sender when it is marked as delivered.After about 2 weeks of fighting with them, some kind woman looked it up and found they had delivered it to Amazon's return mail room. What kind of idiot does that? it still shows as delivered to this date. Poshmark was good about it."
"They deliver at the wrong adress important letters (governements, banks, ect) in the wrong mailbox and or in the wrong building adress, they leave the packages downstairs without ringing, they hire to many incompetent workers who don't do their job properly, not a good shipping company!!"
"There service sucks. I can't think of any other way to put it, today I had been notified that another package of mine is not going to make it on time. Recently I was was informed that a package I was waiting for was delayed by basically a whole month, then I received another notification saying a second package was delayed, and when the new date of arrival came, I was told that my package has been further delayed. Along side that a different package I have been waiting for didn't arrive at all, I got a notice that it got to Canada post and they lost it. This is ridiculous! I want my packages delivered!"
Called Canada Post to ask if something changed regarding invoicing. Explained we are no longer receiving our invoices anymore. I pressed english and got a rude french women with broken english telling me we send them to your company email address and its your problem if not receiving them. I explained very strange been receiving for 8 yrs. I said i took the time to call you and report not receiving invoices and how many are outstanding. She replied 4 and hung up in my ear. Very rude overpaid lazy call center employees in Ottawa head office. Shows this is a crown corporation so not surprised.
"I had a fellow bike enthusiast ship ma a pair of shocks for my 98 springer from Winnipeg to Calgary. When the driver in Calgary got them to deliver, the driver put a return to sender label on it. When I started tracking the parcel the calgary office apologized and said my address was correct and could not explain why it was sent to Winnipeg as there is no address the same there. Weeks of talking to supervisors and tracking officers the package ended back up at shippers. Canada post said there is nothing they can do but for me to pay again. No guarantees the driver in Calgary won't be to lazy to get out of their vehicle and deliver it in Calgary. Could be I have to pay for another round trip. Shocks will be worn out going back and forth a cross Canada. Tracking number 0433640001138346"
"Shipped two extremely well packed items, both marked fragile, to different parts of the country. Both items were damaged in shipping. They even shattered the Styrofoam packaging protecting the items. Use another, better shipper if you can find one."
"The worst possible choice you can ever have. My own experience here: both me and my wife's passport was picked up by CP Oct 28th from US consulate at Toronto. The passport delivery is a 2-day express service. I received a ""CP has picked up your item from US consulate"" message Oct 28th but never got it delivered till today (Nov 2nd). My wife's passport was delivered Oct 29th but she is not the primary visa holder (J2) - instead I am the one who actually need the passport (J1) to start working in US at Nov 1st. Tried calling them multiple times and none of the agents or the ""supervisors"" they connected for me hold any sense of responsibility of this delay. Basically my passport now is stuck somewhere in their delivery system and none of the ""supervisors"" I called were able to actually help to pinpoint where the item is. I was supposed to start my work in US at Nov 1st and had already called to get it delayed for 2 days; due to CP's inability to deliver an item that is already 2 days past the scheduled delivery date. This is my professional career on the line here yet not a single one of their agents or ""supervisors"" would actually be able to help. I sincerely hope people avoid their service at all cost. Canada Post is really the worst thing I have ever encountered in this beautiful country."
Horrible service. If you live in an apartment building they will say they tried to deliver and leave a notice on lobby door without even buzzing your apartment # to grab your package. Delivery instructions clearly stated to deliver to my unit door and provided my buzzer number. When I called they said sorry they don‚Äôt buzz up numbers they only leave in parcel mail box which my building and not all buildings have so they left at post office for me now to have to pick up which is out of my way and I don‚Äôt drive. Absolutely horrible service!
"Horrible service as always. Always delayed deliveries, never stick to their own tracking info. Amazing how they don't seem to care about client satisfaction or quality of service."
"Believe me if I could give 0 star, I would. 80% of my experiences with Canada post have been truly frustrating. I always dread when they are the courier service handling my delivery. I currently have a package that claims to be have by delivered by 8:30am. Only for me to wake up and find nothing. While searching for my package for the second time, I see the actual postman stop by my building. I ask him about my package and he says he has no package for my address and he didn‚Äôt start working until 9am and that 8:30 was quite early for a delivery. I called them and they did what they always do, create a service ticket. That‚Äôs my experience as a receiver. As a sender, I have only used Canada once to mail an important document to my brother. I figured it‚Äôs Toronto which is 5 hrs away so what could possibly go wrong. It took a whole month to deliver a letter to a city that‚Äôs just 5HRS away. I hadn‚Äôt put tracking on it and at some point I started to worry it was lost so I called and also went to the post office to make an inquiry. The person at the post office said it should have arrived within 2-3 days while the person on the phone said 2-3 weeks. So much confusion and miscommunications. I can‚Äôt help but wonder how they are still running. It‚Äôs also super annoying that I always wake up to these issues and end up starting my day in a bad mood. In conclusion, I would NEVER suggest Canada post to anyone."
"I had a bad experience with Canada Post.
I sent an express parcel since October 18 and it should have delivered within 3 days. Today is October 28 and so far the parcel has not delivered."
"I wished there is options for zero Star
Why Canada Keep such Bad Service to Represent Great Canada I urge Governments to look ate the Most world Bad Service Effect Canada Reputation
The Letter Express Mail Could Take up to 20 Days and no Delivery You have to Go picked up Hello Not everything of our Mistakes we Have to stick to Covid All County special our Nighbour USA. Have great Service Even in Covid and way Cheaper price
This should be Public services hand it to Subcontract if you Can‚Äôt Handel , i wish someone responsible from all over Our MPS Read this if they have time for what we need üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Zero stars!!!!!!. China post tracking tells me its in Canada. Canada tells me it has not arrived yet. Canada Post is full of dingbats. I only use Canada Post if I have to. I would rather pay more then use these dingbats.
Dingbats: replacement term for I D I O T as this site wont let me use that word."
"you don‚Äôt even deserve a one star!
absolutely the worst service ever!
you can‚Äôt even track my package!
I left it with you, you were suppose to send it to Fed Ex, but after 2.5 weeks they still haven‚Äôt received it! So it‚Äôs out floating around in never never land! And you charged me $100.00 for you delivery service!"
This site needs a -5 totally useless rating...if I can avoid using Canada Post I gladly pay any extra shipping costs... they never deliver the packages and are totally useless... Canada Post needs to be abolished... just a waste of time and money sending anything through them !!!
"Yes all the negative reviews seem about right.
Delivery drivers always lie saying they attempted to deliver but never did I have video footage of them just putting a slip in my mailbox to pick up the package at the post office.
The customer support is terrible, supervisors do not care.
Pay for service you do not get..
All these employees should be fired and not allowed to collect EI.
Canada post hires most usless people possible.
I will be changing all my bills to online and never use Canada post again.
I wish they would go bankrupt."
"I‚Äôm shocked that other reviews match the same way I feel right now. Canada Post used to be so good, but now even if you choose the ‚Äúdeliver to front door‚Äù option, they don‚Äôt even bother knocking and put it straight to the mailbox. Even worse, they drop off the package without knocking on the door, leaving it out in the open for people to steal. They also take way too long to ship and their website is horrible if you want to contact them online or have any complaints. I‚Äôm so frustrated with this company, I‚Äôve never had any other problems with other companies. If I could use profanity on this review, I damn well would. Do better Canada Post."
Received a registered parcel from India on April 04. It is still in transit. Initially I was told that they have a backlog due to Covid. Now they are asking me to contact the sender and ask them to contact Canada Post to resolve the issue. How pathetic is it for the sender to initiate trace of the item when the receiver cannot trace it in their backyard. And they cannot make a phone call and resolve the issue. Disgraceful!
Canada Post used to be reliable and affordable. Now they are neither and are a total rip-off
you already know.. these reviews could be about www.canada .ca for the last 15 years
"I read a GREAT deal of people complaining about problems they've been having, almost EXCLUSIVELY. But honestly you can't accurately judge an ENTIRE federal organization simply by how they have acted in your area. In my area (Close to kingston, ontario) I always receive prompt delivery and they typically don't make me drive to the post office for parcels. I ordered a package via Xpresspost that was processed by CP on the 18th in richmond BC, it was in missisauga the very next day, and over night it travelled from missisauga to kingston before travelling to its final destination(Local office). Received an out for delivery notice and within 2 hours it had arrived! (about 10 am) Really impressed."
"I agree with all these reviews. Unfortunately, most online retailers give CP as the only option. CP owes me hundreds for late delivery guarantees unrefunded over the years. Now, even if you buy express service, they don't even attempt a delivery. I only use CP when I have no other choice. They deserve 0 stars."
"For years I've been avoiding these lazy incompetents. I even arranged for Amazon to stop using them to ship my orders. We pay for them to track parcels and deliver them, but Canada Post refuses to do either. And if your parcel is expensive, they are happy to steal it.

People may not realize this, but two years ago they stopped delivering parcels to customers. Now they leave tickets telling us to do their job for them by schlepping to their post offices to pick our parcels up. They even post this policy on their website now, with no explanation why.

Recently I ordered a parcel from Europe, that cost over $1000. They shipped it via their country's postal service, which handed it off to the muppets at Canada Post. Had I known that these sticky fingered clowns would have access to my parcel I'd have spent the extra $100 to have it shipped with a real courier. In the past Canada Post operatives have stolen two high value parcels from me. Anything over $200 value is fair game for these thieves. They stop scanning a parcel so it can't be traced, and then it teleports into the back of some CP employee's car. Then they lie to the customer that it's ""on its way"".

The clowns stopped scanning my shipment as soon as it cleared customs in BC. I guess there must have been a customs sticker on the box with the value. Normally a Canada Post shipment from BC to Ontario takes 4 days max. It's now been nearly a week and the parcel hasn't been scanned at all. Another mysterious teleporting situation...

I opened a chat session with Canada Post's ""customer service"". All they did was repeat the same non-existent tracking info over and over again, lied and lied that it was coming today, refused to offer to trace the shipment and then became rude and sarcastic when I asked about filing a claim for the value.

They told me to set up email alerts for the shipment, except I did that a week ago and haven't received anything. Then when I complained about the parcel being lost because they refused to do their job and scan it, and told them I'd be filing a claim and they'd lose almost $1100, ""awesome!"" was their ""customer service"" exact reply. So they think it's a big joke when they lose or steal a $1000 shipment.

The real joke is Canada Post and the fact that their tax paying customers have to subsidize their arrogance, incompetence, thievery and laziness. That's on top of the shipping fees we pay ($40 in my case). Customers paying for tracking and for an item to be delivered when CP does neither is also a laff riot for Canada Post. Not a very funny joke, but I'll be telling it to my retailer in Sweden and suggesting he find another way to send merchandise to his Canadian customers."
"If I could write this and make this a zero star I would.
I have no choice but to deal with Canada Post for the packages I received for my business.
The courier always makes no attempt to deliver my package and leaves me a slip with no information as the date they came when to pick up my package nothing.
If you call customer service they're even worse.
If people pay for a package to be delivered to their home and The courier is not making the proper attempts why are we paying?"
"One of my items was lost during delivery process after it was received by CP. Despite contacting CP customer service several times, there was no progress for over a week, and in the end, I received an automated message from CP to contact the sender. Very poor customer service regarding items that were not delivered properly."
"I give a zero star, bad service, no care what‚Äôs so ever. They just want to take your money, that‚Äôs all they care about. I sent a package to someone and it came back with ‚Äúno such address. I even checked it twice and looked it up on maps. They even short changed my refund by over $5. They have clowns working there. I went with another carrier."
"Canada Post should not have a monopoly on international deliveries, they are slow and delayed. Very unhelpful and disorganized. Canada needs a consumer first postal service that actually cares"
"Website profiles appear to be regularly corrupted by maintenance to their back-end.

Had a website account, my personalised dashboard tracking acquired a permanent ""problem with your information"" notification. Tweeted support who advised me to ""clear my cache"", even though the problem is consistent on different web browsers and, indeed, different physical devices. Their phone support is permanent queue that no sane person has time for.

Finally gave up in frustration, decided to delete my account, got a notice asking me to call a 1-800 number. Figured I'd call it, got a message that it would be out of service on some date over a year ago. Hilarious! You got me again, Canada Post, you wags!

Deleted my account, created a new one.
Tracking was working again, was happy to get that back. Then regular system maintenance happened and the tracking in my dashboard is showing the ""problem"" message again.

I'll avoid using Canada Post website accounts going forward, as this recurring issue seems to indicate instability in the personal accounts. This is probably caused by back-end issues that could be security problems."
I send parcel for next day delivery from Edmonton to fort Mac on the 28 September I track down today they said will be delivered on October 13 I‚Äôm wondering how this company stay in business
An order I placed online was sent late with delivery october 12. I needed it for this weekend. I saw it was at the Edmonton depot this morning. I called Canada post and asked if I could pick it up. They made arrangements for it to be delivered today. Thank you Canada post for the great service!
Worst shipping company I've ever dealt with. Why bother buzzing the apartment if your going to send a failure notice within 20 seconds of me buzzing you in.
The worst courier you can ever deal with. Even after you file a ticket because your package was delayed they don't even get back to you!!! The ticket can get automatically closed and you don't receive any notification to your email or phone number. I used express post and yet my package was more than a week late now and they don't even send an update or an apology or anything!!! Don't ever deal with them
very bad service expected delivery date changed 2 times and shen the parcel was out for delivery now when i track it says there is error and they will update me about the delivery and even no date to expect delivery first and last time i deal with them
"Should someone do serious thing about Canada Post.
Their service is absolutely ridiculous. The express service is slower than regular mail.
JUST RIPPING YOU OFF. There is no useful customer support. It's much better to use other carrier companies and stay away of headache."
"Absolutely horrible service even the supervisor cannot solve the problem you have very important mail coming waiting for a month before they fix. Calling you every week saying next week I will updates you again!
Better have personal mailbox before!"
"Canada post has Absolutely the worst shipping company there is. Always past the due delivery date, probably due to the fact that they will sit on it in a location at times for up to a week. The amount we pay for shipping is Absolutely ridiculous and especially for the really bad service they provide."
"Worst shipping service ever, my package was delayed for no reason"
"I think it's time they were shown the door! They are absolute joke of a company along with those other thieves, ICBC!
From the bottom to the top? Such a badly run company. No responsibility for anything they do! And what they charge for there second rate service is scandalous!
You as a nation put up with that bull!!!!"
"I never received my order I called 7 times with no result they keep saying to wait longer when it supposed to be deliver two weeks ago when I told them my order is all gifts and Iam travelling this week I need my package before travelling. I ended up buying new gifts and travelling
I also talked with supervisor and told me to wait longer so they can solve the issue and it‚Äôs been three days and I received nothing
Very inconvenient"
"Absolutely the worst mail service there is to exist , every employee I talk to regarding my missing package or tracking info not working or it just being them not taking responsibility and just passing the blame down and trying to get me to waste time with their garbage chat service . I will never suggest Canada post to anyone because there‚Äôs a 50% chance you won‚Äôt see that package and then they blame you for it . Most incompetent staff memebers I‚Äôve have ever dealt with that have 0 customer relations skills weather it be me going into a Cambodia post location or dealing with them online . Your better odd training a pack mule to go retrieve and deliver your things
I wish I could rate this company negative because I‚Äôve never had a good experience with them"
I'm not satisfied with their delivery service. They put a notice left on my tracking # but no card left on the mail and not trying to ring the bell. They just bring back to the post office without trying to ring the bell for the house if no body is there.üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
"Absolutely shocking service which seems to be getting worst as time goes on. Really needs to be wound up and made private. 1.5 months into a 4 day delivery and no updates from them, and trying to palm customers off to use their ridiculous and lazy chatbot service. I will never use Canada post again as a first option for anything."
"Deliberately obstructive. I sent a package via Canada Post last month and it was returned 'Incomplete Address'. Only the address wasn't incomplete- it had the persons name, street address, town, state and postcode. Furthermore all details were completed correctly.
The impression is that they are a company that just doesn't care."
"Can we please have this company shut down already.
Other operators that haven't been in the game nearly as long have demonstrated that it's possible to have excellent, affordable service."
"Fix your tracker app, never updates. And garbage delivery time was out for delivery for 4 hours now have to wait till Monday."
Canada post gave me an expected delivery date and that day came with no package i spoke to them to find out when it would be delivered and why i have not recieved any updates on tracking only given the expected delivery date and was told they had no idea where it was and it had not even been processed yet. Its been a week and its just sitting somewhere in a bin in a warehouse or maybe the post office where it was dropped off to and they dont know where it is or when someone will process it for delivery and are using covid as an excuse. Covid has been around for like almost 2 years now and every other delivery service has been able to make adjustments for safety for its employees and still get things delivered on time or have the professionalism to tell you its going it be late instead of it just not showing up and you having to try and track it down inly to find out it hasnt even been processed they dont even know where it is when they they find it or when they will process it or when it will be delivered. And then just say i apologise but because of covid and the safety of our employees and them being able to work at a safe distance and they are behind and there is nothing they can do. I order from amazon and i told when my package is shipped when it will get to me usually 1 to 3 business days who my delivery driver is how many what number in que i am for that driver that day and estimed time then i get a notification when it delivered with a picture of the delivery because of contacless delivery protocols and canada post just gives me a expected date to arrive without any updates and dont even know where it is. Very unprofessional and just gave excuses with no solutions or even willing or able to find item
"This company has easily the most lazy and careless service I've ever experienced. I have had packages take months to reach my door. Customer service never helps, they just tell you to wait and add you to email updates, pretending like that does anything. The website will lie to you: it tells you expected delivery and then change it every day as the package doesn't come. Overseas shipping? Canada Post will leave international packages in ""processing"" for weeks and tell you they never received them. They went on strike right before Christmas and then complained to me that they were backed up from ""all this mail"". The delivery people don't care. The warehouse people don't care. The customer service people don't care. They would rather take your money and do the absolute worst job than even give one ounce of effort to ensuring it's done correctly. If you use Canada Post, be prepared to have major delays, awful customer service, damaged or missing parcels, and a lot of headaches. I will never use Canada Post again so long as I live."
"Wish you could give it less than one star. Worst delivery service in the world. You can ship and order from any place in the world but once it's in canada posts hands, it's been stuck in canada for 3 weeks now. ""Arrived at facility - canada"". My 5th week package is going to get here before the 1st week package how does this work?"
I wish i could rate the service in negative. This is the worst service. They should change the service name from xpress to ‚Äòslowest‚Äô or ‚Äòa time waste‚Äô. Their agents claim to ship item in two days when they do not have any knowledge about it. Worst Worst Worst.
If you want your package delivered then don‚Äôt choose Canada Post. They only leave notes and take everything to the post offices. Don‚Äôt even attempt deliveries. It‚Äôs sad that this is the best we can do.
"Spoke to Ray on Sept 21, 2021, who would not give me any information because I could not provide my company Department, I gave her my name and company but the because I could not provide my department she would not give me information about my case #, I don't even remember giving her a department name. What kind of backwards policies and practices does this organization have? They have lost my package and given me two case numbers so far but now won't even pull them up without my department name, which I do not even have such a name. I work for many departments. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, she refusing saying she could not validate me...?"
"They constantly send me the wrong mail, send my mail elsewhere. I contact them and nothing is done. Sending anything takes twice as long as they say it will - a week and a half in Canada - to reach its destination, if it gets there. Never go in person, as you will wait an hour and they don't care if you are elderly waiting outside in the elements. A very unreliable service."
Awful service. I‚Äôm in ridgeway and they always I mean always make bad bad mistakes forget to leave keys for packages or notices they said they left and didn‚Äôt brutal I‚Äôm constantly chasing packages where I avoid buying anything from Canada post sad.
Horrible... send mail back home almost 1 and a half month still in transit!
"Canada post is the worst, I leave in an apartment, they always ring the bell I open and they leave the paper there to go take my packages at there store and am like why do I pay for delivery if I end up doing a 30min drive to go take my packages, this really need to change"
The app hasn't updated in days not very helpful when you live in a tower and are expected to collect your packages without being notified.
I live in Saskatoon Saskatchewan at Snowberry Downs condo complex there are three buildings here lately I have been getting other peoples mail in my mailbox and other people have been getting my mail. The postal worker doesn‚Äôt seem to read the addresses on the mail to deliver to the proper address in the proper apartment building. If you can‚Äôt read then why do you have a job? Canada post needs to take this person off the route
"""Package arrived in Winnipeg Tuesday at 5AM""
I LIVE IN WINNIPEG and I still don't have it on the Friday of the same week.
Employees just jerk off in the warehouse every day or what?"
"Don't go chat online, it's a waste of time. If you get a package lost, go call them directly. Mine was ""delivered"" but in fact i never receive it. The useless chat put me on the wrong track 4 times and when i tried everything they said and finally when i decide to call them instead. They told me it was to late to reopen the status of my order. 215$ lost because multiples peoples at post canada didn't do their job properly."
"These useless tools have no right to charge for their disservice. What an atrocity. After charging us twice to deliver a package, they informed us they lost it and would refund our postage. They did nothing to sort out the mess they caused with lost paperwork or cover the cost for lost goods. We need to purchase insurance for that because we should assume they are incompetent. Can‚Äôt wait until some politician finally shows the balls to put this dinosaur out of its misery. As long as they are comprised of old, out of touch, pension greedy, incompetent and lazy tools - this will never improve."
"Don't trust the online tracking
service I've complained in the past and still the same crap. At 9am it said out for delivery then 20 mins later notice left then 30 minutes later in transit to outlet. Normally I'd say OK but in this case there was no attempt to deliver I didn't receive the notice until 3pm when the delivery person actually came to my apartment and then when I asked if she had the parcel on the truck still and could I get it she was rude,dismissive and said she didn't know where it was. All this for a parcel that was supposed to be HELD FOR PIC
KUP
From now on I will only use canada post as a last resort"
"trash company, they told me my item was gonna be delivered today then leaves a paper notice to pick up at shoppers tomorrow. Very misleading deceiving."
Ordered an item from Amazon to be delivered to the the post office on Wye Rd in the Rexall drug store. I received a call from Amazon saying the post office would not accept my parcel. I called the post office to ask why. I spoke to the very rude Linda who said I should get my parcels delivered to my home address. I tried to explain that I lived in a rural area and that I had had my parcels delivered to the post office in Rexall many times in the past without incident. She said it was not allowed and that the young people that worked there didn't know what they were doing. I asked to speak to her supervisor. After some hesitation she gave his name and then stated that she was more experienced than him anyway so there was no point in taking to him. I tried to explain to her that I had signed up for flex delivery but she wouldn't listen and told me I couldn't have my parcel delivered there. I thought that was the whole point of the flex delivery.
"they leaves your package at the door without even knocking. I don't know why signing isn't required on every package. it's just begging to get stolen.
or
take half a year to ship then upon realizing you are not home, they keep it at a nearby station for 7days before mailing back. but some times they don't leave the little slip so you wouldn't the package came in in the first place."
Not good. I ordered a package through Amazon said leave at my front door (cause I live in a closed area). They attempted to deliver at 11.59 and they said package failed when I was at my home the entire time. They said oh we will attempt delivery again. Now they aren‚Äôt. Not happy. Also tried getting mail keys they said we‚Äôd here back in 3 days and it‚Äôs been over 11 days. Also had a phone that was suppose to be delivered haven‚Äôt heard anything on that at all. I‚Äôm very disappointed and am never going to use there service again. They aren‚Äôt reliable.
Package takes 3 weeks to ship on ‚Äúexpected delivery date‚Äù then doesn‚Äôt come for another week and keeps moving the ETA on my package back day by day. Terrible shipping
"I had something shipped from china and it took over a month to get here and after that they claimed it was being returned to sender today and I called them and they had no idea why it was being returned after I pushed a bit they said it ""might"" be because the address is wrong but I call the company that was sending it and they gave me the same address I have been shipping with for years so I have to wait another month or so and my package is sitting just across the street from me at the pickup center and the company can not even figure out why I can not pick it up. Honestly I will never use this company again it's awful and they can't ship a basic package with out messing it up I have no idea why they are even still around."
"Worst mail company ever. Horrible effort, pathetic delivery system and abysmal service. If given the option I will NEVER select Canada post as my delivery service. Definitely choose another company if possible. If I could give 0 stars I would."
"Bought some stuff that ships from the Greater Toronto Area with Express post (3 day shipping) on august 31st. It said my delivery date would be September 3rd, then the 7th and now it says the 8th, but I called them today and they said to not expect it for another day or 2. Keep in mind I only live 4 hours away from Toronto. Canada post is the worst delivery service and they keep using covid as an excuse"
I've ordered 5 orders... They all made it to me except the 1st one... Doesn't make sense... In only a few days it took to get to Canada Mississauga by air... It's funny u would think now that its in Canada it would finally get to me sooner now.. Only 2 stops to go... Been in Mississauga since August 20th was supposed to be delivered the 23rd ... I think they lost my package in their warehouse or something... Y did I get all my other packages except that one ... but I didn't get my first package .... No excuses for that... Has nothing to do with delays or safety.... I thought it was because I ordered outside of Canada & those people take forever but they only took a few days to get to Canada.... üá®üá¶ now that's it's here it's not moving.. Been a sitting duck for 2 weeks... Something isn't right.. They need to get their crap Together... Whoever is in charge should step up or have somebody else take over... I'm soooooo mad... By the time it gets to me summer will be over n I won't have any use for it anymore... I'm happy I paid insurance because this is bull crap .. üêÇüí© had plenty of chances especially when all my other orders came in & ordered from the same store üïí‚ùì... Anyways just leaving a review incase someone else is going through this.... I just placed another order from the same store... Let's see if this new package will get to me before my 1st package does... Grrr üì¶üëÄ
"Had some car parts shipped from Ontario from Can Par, they dont ship out to my rural area so they transfered the package to CP, so my package was in Edmonton for delivery for 2 days now and i call them on the 3rd day to see whats up, they sent it to Calgary 300km away from me, F$‚Ç¨^&""* dumb a@#$√∑. Now my delivery is after the long weekend over 2 weeks to get a package from Ontario to Alberta i should have drove and got it,would have saved me a week."
it be nice when i am offered 3 day express post and my pacage is sent on the 31 i get a email telling me expected delivery is the 3erd makes sense as i payed for 3 day shipping and 3 business days would be the 3erd.funny how a Canada post customer serves is telling me 3 days would be the 7 i don't know what world you live in but clearly the 3 and 7 way two different days as i read on your company it says your revenue is over 8 .2 billion dollars could we maby try to get peoples packages to them when they have payed for the right to have there item shipped in 3 days over 8.2 billion dollars and my pacage is late every time i get 1 makes me LOL but really upset too i will never mail with Canada post form now on ups or anything but Canada post kind of a joke and makes me wonder why i pay for express when its more like snail mail
Ordered a part out of Wisconsin and it left there July 14. Took a month and a half to get to Canada customs. Now Canada post has it shown as processed through a customs facility Aug 30 iand transfered toa facility in Mississauga on Aug 30 . It is now Sept 2 and still showing as being processed through Mississauga. I think I should get my mower part after the Christmas rush. $40 US for postage. Most of that should be the storage fee. NEVER AGAIN will I ship USPS or Canada post.
"Packages keep being sent to Post office, rather than being delivered as they should be.
Lack of address verification prior delivery, no efforts to make it work, Canada Post is the only carrier with which I‚Äôve had that kind of issues, every time I need to fight to get the package. Their service is a joke‚Ä¶"
"Canada post is the ever worst for sending and receiving the couriers not only internationally but the local one also. This is the second time they have lost my courier and I don't know why. Some official documents are there and when I went for pickup they they just pass the excuss that they don't have. Earlier my brother send my 27Kg luggage from Montreal(QC) to Moncton(NB) and They lost it. After so many verifications and calls, they didn't do anything. Their staff is so careless and why don't they leave their post if they have such kind of hell people in their team. They always pass excuss and do nothing.
Does anyone suggest to me what should I do now ?"
I did send package to Lithuania on July 11th and it‚Äôs August 29th and package no where to be found. Post office did not take any responsibility for lost packages. I wander how come they get away with loosing or steeling packages . I would advise to anyone who will attempt to use post office service to get tracking number which will cost much more money or find another shipping company.
"They don't care, returned to sender instead of holding for 24 hours like they are supposed to. No apologies."
There should be a catagory below worst for this organization. Promised devivery the next day turned into 7 days. Waste of our tax dollars.
"Multiple times CP has ""attempted"" to deliver our customers' orders while our customers never received a knock on the door, a notice in their mailbox, and email, a call...nada! Then CP just ships it back to the US after a month of sitting on it and doing nothing. Pure incompetence."
"The site said my package was in town and sent out on Tuesday; the next update was 4am that night saying the address is wrong, but the address on the package was correct. It said this two more days in a row. 3 Canada Post trucks drove past my apartment per day, and none of them left my package. It arrive after midnight on Thursday night. Horrendous service."
This is the third time my package has been lost or stolen and no one is there to help you. Where does my package go? It gets through all the other scans except For my home city it just gets lost or stolen. I don't even know how Canada Post still exists because they obviously don't care about their customers and getting there packages
How does Canada Post still existing? My package has been traveling around Canada and even traveled more cities than I did in past 7 years and still traveling ‚ò†Ô∏è
Worst carrier in Canada! There are issues with one out of 2 deliveries. They don't follow any standards.
"It's a delivery service but they don't even bother to even try to deliver. The item shows as ""out for delivery"" and right after, ""delivery attempted but failed, notice left at door"" even though I was home and no CP truck even came through the street. Even worse, they don't even leave a notice at all, they just don't bother doing their job. Every. Single. Time. Why call it a postal or delivery service if you're just not doing what you're supposed to. So fed up with it"
"When I have my regular carrier, I'm pretty well a five star guy. But when these useless temps or fill-ins or whatever they are can't deliver the smallest of packages and leave a notice by default‚ÄîI was home, you idiot‚ÄîI get a little irate. Deliver my mail, you lazy meathead."
"Plain BAD. An embarrassment to our country.
My registered package containing important documents, demanded to be seen by a Govt agency in Mississauga ON, was bounced back and forth back and forth 8 TIMES, from Langley BC (where it was mailed) to Richmond BC (to be processed) over an EIGHT DAY period. Who does that? What kind of crazy setup allows that to happen? Then on the 9th day, after many phone calls over many days, was told package was finally on it's way. But latest Tracking Up-date, as I write, shows it's still in Langley. Who or what to believe? I'm pretty much at my wits end already. I also blame the Government, for putting citizens property at risk and causing them high anxiety by demanding originals of important irreplaceable personal documents be sent across the breath of the country, and for failing to warn us to use a private courier. There are Canada Service Centres in most cities of every Provence that we could go to in person with our precious personal papers, and have peace of mind, they're kept in safe custody."
Lost my parcel for the fifth time!!!My third world country's courier can deliver better.P**ce of sh** delivery courier service.Shameful.And they keep their hideous looking mailman still working.One day right after these id**ts updated the page as delivered my bf went to check and our parcel wasn't there.So where is our parcel going???Disgusting
Canada Post is a total fraud. The unions and border agents keep playing political games with the US and the Canadian government. They are purposely screwing Canadians and Americans over. They keep trying to say Covid Covid Covid oh no the Covid to try and justify the delays. WRONG! The pandemic is over folks! Get back to work and stop being lazy and useless. People are waiting for weeks and sometimes months due to customs and border delays because a bunch of lazy spoiled & privileged brats didn't get a pay raise. It's absolutely ridiculous that we are forced to deal with Canada Post and the customs BS and the strikes from CBSA and others. Why only Canada Post deals with this? Why can't anyone else handle this? My Fedex and UPS orders come just fine and go through the same customs BS but they actually arrive within a reasonable time. NO EXCUSES. GET YOUR SH!T TOGETHER ALREADY!! SO FRUSTRATING. STOP PLAYING GAMES!!
It has been 8 years that we have a dog and in the summer we put up three patio chairs on our balcony so that the dog cannot run away we block the balcony with the chairs. There was no problem with that until today we got a message saying these chairs obstruct access to the mailbox for mail delivery. I strongly feel that this is very uncalled for. They were able to put the notice in the mailbox yet they are incapable of delivering the mail. It doesn‚Äôt take much to move a chair to access the mailbox. The chairs are made of resin they are very light and easy to move. Canada Post is a lazy government run body and something needs to change. Whoever is managing them is not competent.
"pay for the express, enjoy the slowest service"
Canada post is the worst I been waiting for my package now for 2 weeks I called them and all they said was wait till the 20th of aug‚Ä¶. This is the worst carrier we as people should stop using Canada post period. And watch them go bankrupt they are not worth it to give or send mail threw them guys stop don‚Äôt use Canada post they don‚Äôt care about you or your mail.
"Paid the extra for express post thinking quick delivery. Package sits at etobicoke for 2 days, moves to next location, Mississauga for a further 2 day rest. Canada post updates the delivery estimated date to a later date. Hahaha. What a joke. At this pace it may take 2 weeks to get to Waterdown."
"OK. So I have had a few challenges recently with Canada Post delivering my parcels to our community mailbox and putting the keys to open the parcel compartment in my neighbour‚Äôs mailbox. Today two parcels were supposed to have been delivered, but no key for me to open compartment. I filed a ticket on-line (a bit frustrating but I did). I then got a follow up call from John Goodger with CP. he was truly awesome. On a Friday night at 9:20 pm he came to our community mailbox and opened it up to check the compartments. Luckily my packages were there. I was so impressed that he would actually drive to our mailbox, meet me there, in an effort to solve the problem. Mistakes happen but this customer service was exemplary."
"""Item delayed ‚Äî stay tuned for updates"" sounds like Canada Post is doing something and you should wait to receive updates. This is false, you must initiate an investigation (open a ticket) if your package does not arrive by the delivery date. By naturally giving them days ,weeks to deliver, you are only delaying the eventual start of the investigation (this is not auto-initiated regardless of how late your package is)."
"Constantly misplace my packages. Filed tickets, many tickets multiple times but never gotten any real explanations as to why there are so many issue.Fedex and UPS never lose my packages. Can you learn from them please."
"Canada Post's so-called Knock, Drop, and Go policy (""Safe Drop"") is very unprofessional and lazy, incredibly unempathetic and inconsiderate for both the sender and receiver, and their property, through incompetence, maliciousness, and negligence, especially for persons who are tenants of apartment buildings. Packages, even high value items, are being left in hallway spaces (common areas), with free access to anyone in the building, and are highly subject to theft, especially for suites located in high-traffic zones such as those near main entrances, parking areas, stairways, and elevators. They don't bother to verify if there is anyone even home and available to pick up packages before abandoning them; this is not a ""delivery"", it is abandonment and negligence. This policy victimizes customers and seemingly sacrifices the security, privacy, and integrity of mail, while claiming to favour so-called ""social distancing"".

Unfortunately this has been a recurring problem for a decade, so COVID-19 is no excuse. Creating service tickets only temporarily helps (and ONLY if/when depot supervisors/superintendents actually care about the nature of these complaints), because the actual delivery agents themselves too often could not care less, their turnover rate so high and training so poor that the problem simply repeats with new employees.

FlexDelivery and parcel lockers are fair suggestions, but are ultimately used as excuses for negligence.

If items are unable to be placed in secure mail boxes in apartment buildings, Canada Post MUST leave a delivery notice card and forward such items to the local post office for pick up. If necessary, Canada Post should create a system and database for scheduled pick up. I have reported this type of malpractice several times now. It is unconscionable that Canada Post is victimizing people by sacrificing the security, privacy, and integrity of mail. This is absolutely unacceptable and I demand that this be resolved immediately.

Here are just a few reasons Canada Post should be FULLY privatized to give consumers actual choice in a free market over the current monopoly:

‚Ä¢ letter carrier transportation sub-contracted through private taxi cabs companies
‚Ä¢ parcel delivery sub-contracted
‚Ä¢ mail box pickup sub-contracted with U-Haul trucks
‚Ä¢ customer service sub-contracted through private call centres, non-CUPW employees
‚Ä¢ post offices managed as private franchises
‚Ä¢ FedEx and DHL handle and deliver certain packages coming from the USA on behalf of Canada Post
‚Ä¢ Purolator handles and delivers certain packages on behalf of Canada Post, and Canada Post (i.e. the taxpayer) holds shares in a formerly private company
‚Ä¢ Amazon has set up their own successful delivery service to bypass Canada Post because of the frequent strikes and unreliability of the service

‚Ä¢ 2 major strikes in 5 years (2016, 2018); greed, selfishness
‚Ä¢ strikes throw public under the bus; strategically and tactically using public as pawns during onset of Christmas holiday seasons for maximum leverage, negotiation, bargaining for their personal gain
‚Ä¢ simple job not requiring any post secondary education, 10yo can deliver papers and do many similar jobs at Canada Post
‚Ä¢ if CUPW employees don't want to work they should quit, hire people who want to work, hire paperboys/papergirls
‚Ä¢ other countries and marketplace sellers/platforms (Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, etc.) are blacklisting Canada to protect themselves from claims, lost/stolen/undelivered packages, and refunds"
I have a package that was supposed to arrive two days ago but when I check the tracking it appears to have been sitting in the Richmond sorting centre for three days and is now expected to arrive tomorrow. Absolutely trash service and the only delivery service that I have ever had problems with.
The worst... status says notice left.... no notice left... been here the whole time... when they do come they just leave a notice and don't even ring the bell. The chat function is useless. I vote we disband Canada Post.
Horrible experience with tracking number still can't find my parcel.
"This is the third consecutive time I've ordered an item that is listed as delivered but it was never delivered to me. For a total of $300 and the seller uses the Canada post, delivered status to win the dispute/claims. So you can't get a refund. How is this even legal."
"If I could give these people zero stars I would. I placed an order online and unfortunately Canada Post was the deliverer. I was tracking the package and it said ""notice left"" and for me to pick up at the nearest location which didn't make any sense because the thing is my apartment building has just installed a Canada Post parcel box where packages are supposed to be left inside where they put a key in your mailbox and you take the key and retrieve your package. Well I guess it was too much work for the halfwit employee to walk literally 8 feet and place the package inside that lobby parcel box and instead left the notice. The package would of easily fit inside the box so that can't be used as an excuse here.

Its no wonder theyre one of the most hated corporations in this country. In my 34 years I have never once heard anything positive about them. The delivery charge shouldn't of had to be paid if this is what they call service.

Keep up the great work Canada Post. You're pathetic."
I ordered a battery from Jason at Segway in Toronto. I live in Manitoba winnipeg. The item was shipped out July 16th and it‚Äôs now Augusta 11th. The package came to Winnipeg didn‚Äôt get dropped off then went back to Toronto. I can‚Äôt seem to reach a human to talk about my problem when I message them on Facebook it‚Äôs all the same automated replies and they do nothing to help your situation. I‚Äôd never use them again
They never even attempt to deliver packages. They just leave notices saying they attempted delivery and then make you come to them to get the package.
"The delivery guy would ring the bell to my apt, I would go down to get it and the person left, leaving a notice which i would need to get from Jean Coutu. They don't have the patience to wait and I'm a very busy person."
Absolutely the worst courier company in all of Canada. They held my package an hour away from me for 4 days before finally bringing it to my town. I get a notice saying it's ready for pick up so I go to the post office and... it's still on the truck not ready yet.
"Canada Post delivery man will NOT knock at your door they will dash your stuff at the door. They're so illiterate, they never ever KNOCK. CANADA POST I HATE YOU FOR LETTING SOMEONE STEAL MY BLOUSE! YOU ARE LAZY, AND NO GOOD."
"I have been lodging complaints to Canada post easily 2 years before the 'excuse of covid delivery delays'. Your service is terrible! Sometimes we don't receive mail and if we do, it's at 5pm. I have medical issues, disability forms etc and need to receive my mail promptly. I'm tired of covid being the additional excuse. I wish when I purchase items online that I can some how choose some other carrier other than Canada post. I receive items from Hong Kong faster than Canada post!"
"Canada post has my item held in their facility for 2 weeks. There has been no updates, besides the one where I update the preference to deliver to my door. I called them and with the worst service I have ever listened to they said that they have it and I should wait for updates. The expected delivery has already been updated twice and the item hasn‚Äôt even been shipped yet. Terrible shipping company. Tarnishes the already ruined Canadian reputation."
"Canada Post is by far the worst delivery postal service in Canada. They are slow, and customer service lacks customer care. It took 3 days for my current package to get to Calgary from Ontario, which is more than reasonable, however I am in central Alberta, and my parcel has been in Calgary for 4 days, and now expected delivery is set for Tuesday the 10th. Why does it take 8 days for my package to arrive when it is only a 2 hour drive from my home? I am better off driving to Calgary myself to collect my stuff. I hate using Canada Post, and try to avoid buying anything online that ships through them. How can you charge so much for your service, which you are obviously unable to provide? My suggestion would be to use any other delivery service available. You will only find yourself frustrated, and in need of an advil. Oh and if I hear them blame COVID one more time I will come undone! You had these issues pre pandemic! I'm not surprised by the 1 star rating with over 4000 reviews on here. I would say they should be ashamed of themselves, but as there has been zero change over the years (other than price increases) they could care less. They might wake up if people stop using their services."
"Worst run company in all of Canada. Actually i would go as far as to say they are corrupt. For the past few months, I get scam calls the day i have a delivery coming from Canada Post. Border problem, I owe money to get my order etc. Ironic? Probably scammers are their own employees. Lucky us as Canadians, we have no options. Like so many other businesses in Canada, Canada Post has a monopoly, thanks to our government. No competition, no need to better your business. Use Canada Post at your own risk, i personally would never use again, but i have too, really my only option for mailbox delivery"
"Canada post never left me notice at my door except the final notice, since many year...all my parcels are delayed

After many call to Canada Post nothing is done !

Worst customer service"
"I Paid an extra 30 dollars for expedited shipping to have a clothing order here by this weekend for an event. Canada post messed around long enough that I didn't get my package on time and am out my order for the weekend I ordered it for to begin with, even AFTER paying the extra to have it expedited. I will avoid this service at all costs in the future. Not impressed at all."
"I used Canada Post to send a package to a friend in Toronto. My friend quickly received the item within two days which was great, although unfortunately it was never marked as ""delivered"" by Canada post. I then provided Canada post with my friends email and phone number as thats what they told me they need to confirm delivery. Three weeks later, they have yet to even attempt to contact my friend to confirm delivery. And now it is being transferred to the ""claims department"" for ""further investigation"" when at the end of the day all they had to do was pick up a phone and call my friend to confirm delivery. To summarize, Canada Post is a pitiful and utterly disappointing business that fails to meet the most simplest needs of their customers."
"My package was apparently refused at my office building. I highly doubt this happened as delivery instructions were added on Amazon during checkout. I called Canada Post and the agent was not helpful at all, had no information as to what happened, and could not stop the package from being returned to the sender. Now I have to re-order the product and ship it to my home address. Why Canada Post cannot stop a package from being returned to the sender if the purchaser contacts them is beyond me. The fact they have no information as to why the package is ""undeliverable"" is beyond frustrating. I have rarely had a pleasant experience with Canada Post when they deliver packages. They should leave package delivery to the professionals, and stick to delivering letters to Santa."
"The kind gentleman at the Plaza 33 PO in Rutland BC, named David, was very patient with me when he had to re-enter my Moneygram info and payment due to a program glitch. I am leaving town tomorrow so do not have time to stop in and tell him ""Thankyou"" as well as to apologize for being impatient (I had to be in Oyama shortly thereafter). He helped me out and I wasn't double charged! Yay!
Date was Thursday Aug. 5th, time was 12:23:20 p.m.
The GST/TPS # is 104674304 and underneath David's name is TR1454036. Thanks again David!"
The WORST! A package can cross the globe faster than they pick it from their warehouse!
Canada post is destroying small businesses with exorbitant shipping rates while charging large corporations like Amazon a fraction of the price. Highest domestic shipping prices on earth.
"I payed a lot for overnight shipping and they fail to do so. They‚Äôll easily take your money but not fully commit on service. On their website they claim it‚Äôs guaranteed or money back, but once you open a claim with them‚Ä¶they refuse to refund or at least help. Regardless of the shipping method you choose, it will be slow and delayed. Scamming company."
"I genuinely feel ashamed that a governmental agency can have such poor management, customer service and reading skills. Their incompetent and irresponsible behavior is truly a sight to behold.

If you want to save your nerves and money, do not use this company."
"Canada Post is certainly the worst parcel handling service in Canada. This ‚ÄúCanadian Corporation‚Äù is not worthy of it‚Äôs name. It‚Äôs association with Loblaws/Shoppers Drug Mart is not conducive to serving the Canadian public. At best it serves Loblaws.

In my experience, they never deliver a parcel to one‚Äôs door. They drop a card and the onus is on the customer to get to a Shoppers location of their assign, convenient or not, to pick up their parcel within 15 calendar days.

For me, it happens to be on DuPont Street in Toronto, a location with no parking, on a busy street, a good 30 minutes‚Äô walk from my house and I have to walk it since there is no parking! And I have to walk back, with a heavy parcel in tow! This is impossible for me.

There could be better locations, some with parking, but choosing another location for myself is not an option. I once had my car towed in the three minutes that I ran into that location to get a parcel. It cost me $250. But that is the least of their concerns. Not only is the service poor and incompetent but their utter lack of concern for their clients is shameful and quite beyond fixing.

I have complained dozens of times to Canada Post about these damned Shoppers‚Äô Drug Mart locations. I used to drive for miles to use one of the few still privately owned locations and then they eliminated them. 99% of the reviews posted here are strongly negative. One can easily sense the deep frustrations of all who troubled themselves to review this service, OUR NATIONAL POSTAL SERVICE!!! but who is reading. Certainly not Canada Post.

If I were Justin Trudeau and company, I would dismantle this outfit tomorrow and install a Canadian Postal service of international standard that we can be proud of. National postal services should be a matter of national pride. Its quality should reflect the image we want to project to the outside world. It is worth paying for. What we have, masquerading as ‚ÄúCanada Post‚Äù is nothing to be proud of. Is it any wonder that their sloppiness has caused the proliferation of a multitude of private delivery services in our country, all of which provide safer and more ethical services to Canadians than our own National Postal Service. There is no redemption possible. The ills of the entire organization are so deep rooted, so deeply engrained into their sub-culture that the organization can never be fixed. To the guillotine! Tomorrow would not be fast enough."
Worst courier service! I don‚Äôt recommend it. My recent experience with Canada Post provoked me to read reviews and write one. They‚Äôve managed to lose 4 of my packages this year in succession. This last lost package is so painful. Years ago (2016) my first shipment arrived after 5 months to the foreign country and the second one in the same year was lost. Very bad.
"the worst service of my life, the packages are lost and nobody is responsible, very bad attention from the workers, better to use another courier company"
"I order tons of online stuff, I get at least two packages a week if not more, and sure enough once a week one of my packages get sent in the wrong direction from the Grande Prairie processing center. Once a week. If this is happening to me , it‚Äôs also happening to others. Tried to contact about this since they say that COVID is always the reason for delayed delivery‚Ä¶um nope..it‚Äôs your employees who couldn‚Äôt care less about their jobs and do t pay attention. Package is 2 hrs away from me and now I have to wait 4 days to get it. This extra travelling obviously costs CP money. But they weren‚Äôt concerned at all, it‚Äôs not late they say it‚Äôll be there.. I don‚Äôt care about that, why don‚Äôt you look into problem areas and do something about it. Sending packages in the wrong direction is avoidable and unacceptable..stop making excuses for crappy employees and replace them with people who want to work."
"It is the worst courier service.I parcelled 18kg of my bag from Montreal to Surrey.But I got the wrong parcel. I had some important things in my bag.And when I opened the service ticket number...They said parcel was lost.When I tried to check the status of my service ticket number by calling them, they hang up my phone twice.I am not recommending this courier service to anyone."
"I lost 2 bids because of this guys ,sent xpress post arrived after bidding"
"Took 5 days to travel from Quebec to Levis, which is 20 minutes drive to be delivered...absolutely poor service not delivering courier effectively for the customer but for their convenience...and we are giving our money to pay this service...ü§Æ"
"Please fix your broken system, it happened to me frequently, the latest one is about one of my packages, it eta 27th July 2021, so on 23rd they left the notice paper at my door, says pick up tomorrow after 13pm, I wanted to make sure that my package will be there when I go, so I waited until Monday, I went there the girl said, not there yet, come next day, but before you come call us first if it‚Äôs there already for me to pick up,"
"The worst mail service there could ever be. Waste of time and a waste of money. Why use guaranteed delivery dates when they have no plan on getting the package to you on time. Next time I order something I‚Äôll pack all my bags and sail the 7 seas and go pick it up myself, rather then rely on a dated, useless service. Don‚Äôt waste your time."
"I thought china post was the worst postal service in the world. I ignorantly agreed to use Canada post and I can't issue a ticket for my item that has had no update for 3 weeks, unless I'm the seller or living in Canada. Now I'm fighting for a refund through PayPal. To Canada post, there's no bottom to their abyss of incompetency."
"I accidently dropped my cell phone in the street mailbox when I took out the mail from work. Called canada post, and spoke with Bassam who logged a ticket. I went back to the mailbox to see if I could catch the driver picking up. HE WAS THERE TO RETRIEVE MY CELLPHONE! I am blown away. Had my phone back within an hour! Thank you Tanya (supervisor) for letting him give it to me and to the driver Edward for attending. I am so grateful, and very impressed!"
"Wow. These reviews say it all, really. One star.

They‚Äôre not very good at delivering things for a delivery company. It‚Äôs got so bad that‚Äôs it‚Äôs quite amusing now.

They‚Äôve managed to lose 4 of my packages in succession. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the drivers or their superiors, but they just can‚Äôt seem to do the one job they‚Äôre paid to do: deliver."
"They rejected a ton of my packages this week, as they cannot have the word box in the address. It has to say the number and station main. I will always tell people to never use Canada Post. Worst shipping company out there. Plus they often lose packages. Very frustrating"
Very long and no updates on delivery date it been 2 weeks and no update as well as no telling when they are going to deliver my package that i paid extra for it to have express shipping like why do we pay extra for nothing
"This is the most unprofessional company (along with Ombudsman) I have dealt with! We never got our parcel back (the parcel itself was 1000 dollars). Canada Post claims that they have dropped it in front of our door; in reality we never received any phone calls, emails, notice, or even a paper-slip on our door about its arrival. We live in an apartment that only has a gate, it does not have a common place to drop packages. But they never contacted us in any forms, and we filed this case to Ombudsman, and Ombudsman said ‚ÄúThe item was safe dropped at your apartment building; HOWEVER, YOU DENY RECEIPT.‚Äù Are you kidding me? You guys never even contacted us that it has arrived, you got our number right? why didn't you call us when you arrive, if we never was contacted, how do we even deny receipt? You can not drop a parcel in a public area and call that safe drop! Not only that, you did not even contacted us that it has arrived!

I can not believe a company that has this level of horrible service is still running its business to this day! Is there no agency or even anyone watching over them for their action? What is the relationship between Ombudsman and Canada Post? This is totally LEGAL CORRUPTION."
"Canada Post is very slow to deliver incoming international mail. You cannot trust any mail to be delivered for business or residential purposes in a timely manner. Many of my clients and friends there ask me if I ever posted anything from the UK!

How embarrassing for Canada.

Logistics for this postal group is in a dark place wake up Canada!"
"Canada Post is the worst package delivery. If signature is required they don't even attempt delivery THAT I PAID FOR. All other delivery companies will attempt. When Can post is delivering my Amazon I make arrangements with seller to avoid Canada Post.
*Reg mail delivery 5üåü Package delivery 1üåü or less"
The worst experience ever. My first shipment arrived after 4 months to the foreign county and the second one was lost. Very bad
"Poor customer service, only thing that I found helped was their online bot chat option . Not a good thing."
"The WORST!!! Unfortunately not my choice for shipping.
Parcel from US to London ON
Minnesota (USPS) to Mississauga - 2 DAYS
Released from Customs for processing by Canada Post - 1 day
In Montreal QC 4 DAYS LATER. Totally WRONG DIRECTION.
Inquiry made. Might receive it in the NEXT4 DAYS.
There are MORE EFFICIENT, RELIABLE, and CHEAPER options out there if you do a little homework.
95% BAD RATING no surprise"
"This establishment is one of the Canadian Hall of Shame businesses, it's a joke cause using this service is waste of time, money, and it's a headache for you and your clients.

If you have any chance to avoid their service then do not hesitate and use one of the other providers."
"even though the staff made a mistake, the office is unwilling to give me refund. Not helpful at all."
"Recently I had a package arrive damaged, opened and with contents missing. Canada Post made it an impossible process to claim insurance. Why even offer insurance if you won't allow anyone to use it?

On a different note, the Letter Mail that I send is constantly lost and undelivered regardless if it's stamped appropriately and addressed accurately.

How am I supposed to run a business with a shipping provider like this? If there was a better alternative, I would use it."
Delivery man is a lazy f. Absolutely zero effort made to attempt my Delivery. Don't understand how this man still has a job here. Oak Ridges Ontario location. Fire the guy.
"Can‚Äôt believe Canada Post is so bad, have a order coming from Quebec to Nova Scotia and it ended up in Richmond BC. You would think when they see the mistake they would overnight it but know, don‚Äôt know when i will receive it.
When I order in the future I will tell the company to not use Canada Post."
"Simply stupid policy and irresponsible, no matter people affairs, time and money loss due to their stupid and lazy performance.
They kept on verifying my address for more than 1 week for missing unit number, despite my phone number is written on the letter !!! and the full address was correct, moreover they attend daily to my building! and finally decided to return the letter back to the sender in another city, Regardless my opened ticket through their web site, this is totally insane."
"I've had nothing but bad experiences with these people. Normally it's things like my package is a month late or something like that but recently I have had even more frustrating experiences just trying to prove I am who I am.

After ordering a package that would be too large to fit in my mailbox or leave at my door (not sure why it's to large to leave at my door but it is what it is) they sent me a notification that they left a notification delivery card. However after checking both my front door and my mailbox there was no card. So I attempt to go to the post office anyways to get my package thinking I should be fine since I can prove who I am with my drivers license. However when I get there the person at the desk would not take my card because it is expired. Due to covid I have not gotten my cards renewed yet because I've only just received my second dose and did not want to risk anything yet. I figured this wouldn't be a problem since the government of Canada has held off invalidating expired cards that expired after a certain date (which my card has). I even checked the validity of my card online and it assures me that it is still a valid card. Fortunately they say I can get my passport to prove my identity, so I do that. But now they require a proof of address because I don't have the notification of delivery card that they failed to deliver. This is fine because I have bank documents proving my location on my phone ( I use simplii so all my documents and banking is done online ). However the worker at the desk refuses to look at my phone, stating that ""we don't look at phones"". Fortunately I also have a TD self-directed investing account so go to the nearest TD and get them to first change the address on my account ( my address doesn't match the delivery address because I am currently living with my parents since work is remote right now and I enjoy the company ) then get them to print a document for me to show this address. WOW PROVES THAT I LIVE AT THAT ADDRESS SO MUCH RIGHT? Something that definitely could not have been done through documents shown or printed from my phone. Finally I go back to the post office and they let me take my package. But not before giving the box a cheeky little tap on the circled sticker on it that is supposed to indicate that a notice of delivery has been delivered and telling me ""oh if you brought the notice of delivery you wouldn't have to get the bank document"". WHAT A GREAT IDEA, IF ONLY CANADA POST HAD ACTUALLY DELIVERED THE NOTICE OF DELIVERY.

Overall the whole process took about an hour of my life and has convinced me that Canada Post is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. TD is great though, they were very helpful."
"THE WORST MOST LAZY COMPANY EVER!! THE POINT OF ONLINE SHOPPING IS FOR CONVENIENCE NOT ""PICK UP AT THE POST OFFICE"" EVERYONE HATES YOU CANADA POST"
"I saw the postman outside so i open the door for receiving my package and he present me the ""occupant wasnt here, pick it up tomorow at the post office"". I ask to have my package and he said he cant because he already scan it like i wasnt there and he cant undone it. Dude, you kept my stuff in the van and filling the little note and didnt bother knock at my door!! I was right there waiting for you. I had to pick up my package the day after at the post office."
What else is there to say with the worst system in the world. This should go belly up and leave the place for the private sector. Bunches of LAZY and LIARS. They tell you they've made an attempt when it's a complete lie wake up Canada Post you can tell whatever lie you want I have cameras and nowadays people have cameras on their house.Are you a bunch of retar d or what? probably and blames just about anybody for their f u c k up they're always in the clear. I'm waiting on something probably to big for lazy sob to carry and the tracking number says that you made an attempt BS and now I will have to go to the pharmacy to fetch it because it's to heavy for you (unionized up to your ears) but not for USPS. And I will claim my box HOW where's my claiming receipt????????
One of the careless package services is what defines canada post. They lose a package and don't even want to pay the compensation. The post mans work here are thieves as they can enter into any building without permission and break throughout all security systems. Sending an item of 25 kgs with all important household goods they think I was sending rock and stones in them. Policy is for customer but not for their workers or staff
"Canada Post just lost my business. Fed Ex and Ups from now on. Mailed a parcel which was very light but was charged 21$. The parcel was returned to sender due to an error in address. Now, not only have I payed 21$ but I have to pay another 21$ to get the parcel back. How is this right? The first fee should cover return to sender. During covid,this was a small gift to a shut in. So disappointed. Highway robbery. No service. Never again. James was a very smug, unsympathetic service rep."
"Can anyone explain how a delivery company can stay in business when they don't actually deliver anything? I mean the whole point of online shopping is the convenience, but when you need to jump in the car and drive to the local post office pick up location in the middle of a pandemic because the delivery person couldn't bother to buzz the code that was provided or take an elevator up a few floors to deliver an item, it kind of defeats the purpose of avoiding stores... Seriously, every other delivery company somehow manages to make actual deliveries, but Canada Post just defaults to 'go pick it up yourself'. It lazy, scummy, and it puts the public at risk because now we need to go gather at a local store to get the packages that were supposed to have been shipped directly to the home at a personal cost to the receiver. Instead, Canada Post collects the delivery fees for the 'service' and leaves it to you to figure out how to carry home multiple packages without a vehicle. I mean, can we just have Uber take over for Canada Post? They would probably do a better job based on their food delivery."
Do not think these are read by canada post executives...if they were any company would begin to worry..sent package to australia in march..now july..found out it was sent by boat instead of air...who sends newborn baby clothes by boat..very upset senior..does anyone from canada post care
I ordered a portable power station which was never delivered to my door step my neighbours camera points directly on my front door they said the day and time they delivered we checked the dates no Canada post came surprise then SiriusXM sent me a boom box which sat at the post office for three weeks I was never given a pick up your parcel called Canada post guy was a comedian or something he was practically laughing in my face on the phone so the joker says did you check your mailbox I said you can‚Äôt fit that stuff in my mailbox so all I can say is Canada post your the worst delivery company in the world I pray for your families around the holidays that joker junior gets his parcels oh yeah I‚Äôm not finished with you post Canada the items I ordered were paid in U.S currency 200 bucks that‚Äôs like 500 Canadian joker says go check your neighbours it probably got delivered to one of them I live in a cul de sac we all watch out for one another he‚Äôs calling me my peeps thieves only thieves is post Canada üá®üá¶
"Orders shows delivered and guess what? Nothing recieved! 3 times this happened. No signatures or pic of proof of delivery, just drivers word. Thieves!!! Luckily PayPal refunded."
"I send package to from kingston on to mississauga on they claim delivery 2 business days
Guess what they delivered after 4 days and friend who suppose to take my package to abroad gone 2 days earlier.
Total loss on money and time .
They will refund my money they said.
Coz the guy in Canada post did not inform me that it will take more 2 days
If I only knew that my package won't reach in 2 days around 250 km only
I have not send it .I learned my lesson in hard way
Next time FedEx or ups
Poor poor canadapost .they should shut down there couriers business , it's beyond there capacity."
"YOU SUCK Canada Post!
You sucked when I worked there and you still suck! üñïüèø"
"They said the package had the incorrect address, there was a small typo. I called gave them the correction, they said it all good and it would be delivered that day. The next day it said it got delivered but in a different city and I didn't get it. I called again and they said it was delivered to the original address, but that would be impossible as it was not a real address. they said the person the day before should not have said they could fix the address. Now I have to call the shipper as they will not help me further with the package they delivered to an imaginary address."
"Canada post is absolutely pathetic express post is just a way to steal your money it‚Äôs non existent with this mail service I even wrote to the CEO of Canada post on a previous occasion to express my concerns he did write back with a typical excuse of we are trying to do better I also wrote to the minister of services and procurement who gets paid 200k+ a year and is in charge of directing the postal service she promptly passed the buck .It is a disgrace to Canadians to have such a pathetic postal service we are not a third world country or are we?Canada post only provides excuses not resolutions and by the looks of things has no intention of getting any better ,how about you stop charging folks for express post as obviously it doesn‚Äôt exists"
"Canada Post claims that no one was available to sign for a package yesterday and that the package was being returned to sender, when we were all home and no one heard so much as a doorbell or a knock.

Worst service imaginable - sometimes they just cant be bothered delivering a package so they pretend they tried, but no one was home."
"First of all i sent one year ago a package in Spain,and never arrived!! Now i'm waiting an item from Spain, and it's been more than a month and even with tracking number i don't know where is..also they told me that this tracking number doesn't work with Canada Post!"
"It‚Äôs really a shame that they still operate and cost Canadians so much money with the worst service ever!!!
Unbelievable!!!
Waiting for parcels 5-6 weeks if not more and their excuse is our safety
Total BS!!!"
"they don't care about anything you're shipping, so dont fool yourself.

the letter carriers are overworked and underpaid, and they are stretched too thin to do the job they have been given.

I wish canada had a decent post system."
"Extremely inconsistent and WEIRD shipping practices. Please for the sake of Canadians SHUT DOWN if there are no plans to improve.

Packages bounce between cities due to ‚Äòcapacity reasons‚Äô but the real reason is the inconsistent service. It‚Äôs a dice roll of which package will get super delayed.

Customer support can‚Äôt do anything because they literally can‚Äôt fix this mess of a company."
"One flaming garbage pile of a company that doesnt show any drive to improve. We need a time machine to erase the very conception of this horrible monstorisity from whatever sick and twisted abomination that had thought this up. I have never had a positive experience with canadapost and quite frankly I probably never will because they DO NOT CARE ABOUT US, CANADA POST DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. The customer service line quite possibly has the worst reps out of any company ever, they are comically rude probably about as bad as the delivery guys who cant be bothered to drop off your actual parcel. Yes you read that right the DELIVERY drivers do not DELIVER parcels almost at all and just leave a slip if youre lucky. Paid for priority? Or xpress? Well you have just wasted 35 bucks, it has never been reliable and it never will be. If you order anything live it WILL die, anything fragile WILL smash, and most of the time anything valuable WILL be lost. The day this company of goes under will quite possibly be one of the best days in canadian history. 1 star is honestly way more than this rotten cesspool deserves."
"I just received a gift certificate that I'd ordered in Dec 2018. The envelope was date stamped Jan 2019.

I just found it in my mailbox today - July 3 2021. That's almost 915 days to deliver it.

An actual snail could have delivered it in less time.

Keep up the good work CP."
"CANADA POST IS GARBAGE, UNTRUSTWOTHY COMPANY RUN BY FREEMASON GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I returned an outfit to Alo Yoga back in March 2021 & made a service ticket in May because the item never arrived. I was told I would get an update of my claim/return of money within 10 days. I called in the middle of June because no such answer had happened yet- the agent created a new service ticket & said I would get an answer within 2 business days. No answer at all- so I call back and basically a guy just told me he can‚Äôt give me an answer nor a timeline. #terriblecustomerservice This issue should go to the front of the line & and the issue should be resolved the day I call!

Not great customer service- doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone cares or sees the urgency that I need my money back for the return that I did. The items were worth $220"
"Canada Post is utterly irresponsible, absolutely horrible. They make you pay for express delivery which supposedly is fast but you don't get a refund if there are any delays. Worst customer out there. I pray they go bankrupt."
"Terrible customer service. They delivered my parcel to a house in Ontario, I live in BC. Called to get it sorted and the person told me ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not your parcel because it‚Äôs been delivered & we never get deliveries wrong‚Äù. Got my parcel after days of completing and guess what it did have my address."
"Very bad very irresponsible.
I sent my passport with Canada post and they lost it. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I think 1 star is too much for Canada post."

At 6:40 pm we were sitting beside the mailbox and checking online tracking. The result was: 1. That YOU /Canada Post lied to the point of fraud stating the parcel was deliver this day at 7:07 PM. 2. Question how is it You/Canada Post can deliver into the future? 3. You /Canada Post said, since no one was there (OUTRIGHT LIE), we must now to pick it up at a Carrier Location. Really so where is this location? You/Canada Post did not provide a location. Mail Fraud, deception and lies again, why? 4. Since you/ Canada Post does not know where the package is , has been and did not deliver it please send full payment via e-transfer within 24 hours. This IS a demand for payment!"
"They ""can't do signature deliveries"" because they don't do at the door deliveries.

You can request at the door delivery and they'll drop it at the door.

Your package will be shipped 3 hours away from your city, based on ""efficiency"" and then delay it by 4 days when it could be out for delivery by tomorrow.

Brilliant lack of accountability."
"I thought the problem with my first parcel was just an honest mistake, but the second delivery was just a mess! like come on, this isn't the first time you're doing this right?"
Worst experience with them. I would never let any of my friends to use Canada post now. I gave them a package to ship it to India and paid for an express courier. The parcel didn‚Äôt get delivered yet and when I enquired about my parcel they said Canada post just kept it with them and didn‚Äôt deliver it for 10 days
"Ordered a part on e-bay The part was send out to my address with tracking # the part arrived at the post office but never to my address. Calling the post office is just a nightmare. It is like running against a wall.
Canada Post is the worst parcel delivery system I have ever seen."
"New mailperson has lost 3 of my shipments, not giving me the key for parcel box 2 times. Mailboxes frequently get broken into so im hoping my kids clothing will be there once the key is dropped off. Unless its 2 streets over at same address wrong street name. Total fail canada post. They use to bring my parcels to my door....guess the ceo and all management bonuses trump proper service."
Brutal. Canada post drop off. Called 1-800 number to confirm hours was told wrong hours. Got there and they were open but not accepting bulk mail until 1.5 hours later. Brutal customer service. This is what happens when an organization is a monopoly no focus on providing great service. They have staff there but refuse to service. So I have to wait 1.5 hours until they are willing to accept my bulk mail. üò†
"I had paid for an expresspost letter the fee charged at the Abbey Market, Oakville was $14's as it was a Sunday I had about 10 mins. to complete the transaction. Upon leaving and arriving home, the recipient's address I found was incorrect I called the Post Office and the rep. advised to return tomorrow and that the letter willl be left out for me and won't be sent out, as they were now closing and it was too late to do anything. I returned to the post office, only to find that the clerk refused to return my money, and charged me another $14's only because I had to change the address - same city and nothing added. Told me it's Canada Post's policy, my argument was if it hasn't been sent out or processed yet and I need to add a new address label, then why charge for the same envelope that's been paid - twice! All I got was a shrug in return."
"I sent a letter priority post courier ($31.00) from Vancouver to Calgary. It took five days to get there and then when asked for a refund I get an email ""Canada Post has temporarily suspended our service performance guarantees and we are unable to issue a postage refund for your item."" Why is it, that every other courier company can deliver it the next day? They will continue to lose more customers and get more Government (tax payers) bailout money."
"Interesting, I was reading those horrible stories about Canada Post on Trustpilot, and then‚Ä¶ on June 10, 2021 ‚ÄúMike Parker‚Äù came with 5 stars and wrote:
‚ÄúI've done a lot of online shopping this past 18 months most of it delivered by Canada Post and NOT once have I received anything BUT excellent customer service from Canada Post with every package arriving on time and in perfect condition.‚Äù

Umm.... Smells like the fake review from ‚ÄúMike Parker‚Äù is from Canada Post. Hey Canada Post, while you‚Äôre listening hiding behind ‚ÄúMike Parker‚Äù, here‚Äôs my story.

My package from USPS originating from the US was delivered by Canada Post to the wrong location, and it was lost, although the address I provided was accurate. I was told by Canada Post that the sender/seller in the US should file a claim, which he did. I opened tickets, called many times, and nothing happened. The rude customer agents of Canada Post have been given me the runaround ever since, and still no package and no reimbursement from Canada Post for the lost parcel."
"I have a package that was mailed priority post grinding to Calgary. Priority post is next day, it has been a week with no updates. I phoned Canada post and the excuse I got was‚Ä¶items are taking longer because of covid and the high amount of parcels. I told them to shove covid bullshat up your ass. If I can get other items from Japan and US before Canada post can deliver my items from 3 provinces over, that‚Äôs embarrassing. They are robbing us blind. This government is robbing us blind. Open eyes people it‚Äôs nothing new."
"Hi there, I wish I could say I would like to be a returning Online customer with Hudsons Bay but I am extremely disappointed with the service provided or the lack of service being provided..... I made a purchase online on 05/22/2021 for a Maple Leafs Jersey while they were in the playoffs.....I was emailed a tracking number so I could track the package and its rough arrival time. I was aware at the point of purchase that ""Due to courier volume your order may be delayed. Thanks for your patience.""

When I tracked the package, I was made aware to me that the package had been picked up for shipment from Mississauga Ontario on 05/25/2021 at 4:42pm. It is now 06/17/2021 which is 23 DAYS LATER and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PACKAGE OR ANY UPDATES!!!!

Mississauga to Whitby is ONLY 90km away and less than a 1 hour drive..... ANY excuse or reasoning for a package that says ""Shipment picked up by Canada Post Mississauga, ON"" and not arriving almost a FULL month later is UNACCEPTABLE.... This is the reason you guys cant hold a candle to your fellow competition and makes me seriously regret supporting a local business.

The Delivery stand was suppose to 05/27/2021 we are not talking about international shipping, we are not talking about multi province shipping.... we are talking about from Scarborough, to Mississauga to Whitby.....

WHEN WILL I GET MY PACKAGE?
What do you plan on doing to make me want to give you the opportunity to earn my business again?

This is simply inexcusable."
I keep checking to track my item and it‚Äôll say ‚Äúpackage is expected to arrive today‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt end up showing up then. So the next day it will say soemthing along the lines of ‚Äúunder review‚Äù so I‚Äôll check the next day and it will again say ‚Äúpackage expected today‚Äù only for me to be disappointed AGAIN. üòë
"I called Canada Post 6 times to find out what happened to a REGISTERED LETTER I sent a month and a half ago. I cannot get a response from these Cliff Clavens, for the life of me. No one knows what happened to my letter. Did it arrive? Did it not? No one knows. The employees do not understand nor able to communicate information given the language barrier. Some employees just hang up when they put you on hold. Wait times are ridiculous as well. Today was a 60 minute ordeal for nothing...again. Even the employees who speak fluent English are clueless. It cost me to send it registered, when they are not even getting signatures from the recievers. Why charge if you can't provide the service?"
"Awful company, broke my package worth over 100 dollars, I even bought insurance. Wouldn't reimburse me for my damaged item. DO NOT SHIP THROUGH THIS COMPANY. Use FedEx, UPS, or drive the parcel yourself."
"live in a town of 300 people in a remote location - will keep it hush for now! IMHO CP is the most deplorable and corrupt corporation in Canadian History! Organized crime has inflitrated everywhere.... First, the local Postmaster is a money-hungry, stuck-up, racist and misogynist, who thinks he runs the town! From the start, he was arrogant and brushed us off like garbage! Never seemed to acknowledge us or want us here. We were forced to wait 6 months to get a mailbox because he was under reno, in the pandemic, in a remote location! No mail service cost us a lot of time, money and stress! Finally, after much prodding we got a mailbox. Right away, parcels have gone missing (3, in as many months) and we never received our census! So StatsCan sends me a threatening letter to fill out a census that i never got! Someone is sabotaging our mail! Is it because my son is disabled? Or native? Because we are poor and I'm old?"
"I love that my package shows that it'll be delivered Friday and it's out for delivery..
Then Friday evening it changes and now my package doesn't arrive till tomorrow (Tuesday)..
Thats1 week and we paid for express (should have arrived in 2 days - which was friday) But what does Canada Post care...
I'll be using another company to mail from now on... This is the 3rd time canda post has pulled this and then Shrug their shoulders with a lack of care..
DHL,.FedEx, UPS all promise their delivery date and offer better customer service.."
"What ever you do don't send Canada Post a copy of your review if not a flattering review because I did that and now my parcel is being held up on a bogus reason.
Stating that my address was put in wrong by the sender.
Although I had talked to them a few days prior and they confirmed the address with me on the phone. Now suddenly this happens right after the review.
So I called to verify and apparently everything went ok...they corrected the address and now a day later it is now being held because they are still saying they have to verify the address, though I have already verified the bogus mistake. I had the sender send me a copy also and the address is correct so now it will probably be sent back to the sender.
My husband just got out of the hospital after a two months stay and is now confined to a wheelchair, so he really needs the item... he's been waiting now for a week and a half.
So all this got worse after I made a bad review.
So make your review after you receive your package or you will never recieve it.
These guys can get away with anything.
So be careful.
Chapter 2
I have to say that someone did finally call me and said my package was back out for delivery and would have it that day.
I gotta give them some credit for that..they could of made it alot worse.
They finally did the right thing.
I give them 4* for that.
Although everything worked out it was still a big inconvenience and just remember.
Stay calm until you receive your package.
This is the first time this ever happened.
Mostly they are good."
"Worst company ever, always a delay in shipment, package sits 4hrs away from me for about 2 weeks with no update, always a delay a day after it's shipped from the sender."
"Delivery driver failed to attempt reasonable delivery. Due to COVID procedures, delivery drivers are advised not to contact the resident in any way resulting in a heavy package going back to the post office even though recipient was home and could have been contacted via apartment buzzer or contact number. Depot refused redelivery request and puts the onus on retrieval on the recipient who is at no fault nor a way to retrieve a heavy package expected to be delivered for this reason. Recommend businesses choose other delivery partners. Complete lack of empathy displayed."
I don't even know where to begin I purchased an international item 6 weeks ago paid express shipping provided tracking from the seller when I went to follow up on arrived in Canada 3 weeks ago at the sorting center sat there for two weeks out for delivery didn't show up on my door was sent back to the sorting center back to the original country where the item was shipped from now I'm just waiting for the item to come back cuz it was shipped back from the original country to Canada now it's back at the sorting center like this is a bunch of crock what the heck is our government putting this through and I'm wondering now how many other Canadians are experiencing the same issue I'm having with international parcels what a goddamn joke
"Worst delivery/postal service in history. It is so bad that I contacted Amazon and had Amazon update their delivery options for me, not to include Canada Post. Now all my on-line orders through them are delivered by reliable (never a delivery problem) private companies. The Canadian government (that means us) needs to strip the word and reference to ""CANADA"" from their name and stop funding them with tax money."
I sent three packets to England in February and March 2021 was given the choice of surface or air and paid for airmail. They all took about 8 weeks to get there so they obviously were sent surface mail. Daylight robbery!
I had an item with an expected delivery date of June 3rd after the package made it to their warehouse on June 1st. It is now June 11th and they still have not processed the item or provided me with any information nor expected delivery date. This company always has been and always will be a joke. I don‚Äôt understand why any company uses Canada post.
"Attention all canadians. It is time to rid ourselves of this albatross as well as the money sucking, woke, CBC.

Use any other service other than canaduh post. Call your mp and demand CBC be defunded.

Stop the insane spending on these 2 rotten money grabs."
"It shouldn't call Canada Post!! It is a SHAME to carry the name and flag of this country. I imagine that all those heroes from the 1st and 2nd World Wars turn around in their coffins every time this junk postal service carrying the name ""Canada"" starts the workday.
They are so irresponsible, liars without shame, they don't give a crap at all on customer service!!!
They are all a group of people from the totally corrupt top management to the Union back irresponsible workers.
They were very bad before the Covid-19 and now they are the worse of the worse of postal service!!
As example, I am expecting a package since the beginning of last month and in the suppose tracking number says ""delayed for external factors"" for more than a month and if I check in their crap track application ...everyday says ""delivery today"" and if I check at the end of the day it says: ""delivered tomorrow"". That same crap everyday for a month!!!! Disgusting!!!
Even The Americans who do internet business to Canada and the USPS are giving explicit warning of the insane delays here by the post here!!! Shame!! Shame!!! But they don't give a crap at all!!"
I've done a lot of online shopping this past 18 months most of it delivered by Canada Post and NOT once have I received anything BUT excellent customer service from Canada Post with every package arriving on time and in perfect condition.
sender filed a claim on a missing package when i was called up the agent pretended that their was a connection problem and he kept cutting out. he did the same thing 8 months ago and it is clear they are doing everything they can to discourage you from claiming your items are missing or damaged. i even asked to speak to someone else and the same guy came back and said i am someone different. it is truly disgusting our government does this to us
"Nobody even attempted to deliver.

Was home all day and no knock on the door, look at my tracking number online and it says they left a notice, which they didn't, as they are too incompetent to. Had to talk to a robot to find out where to get my package."
"Absolutely the worst government run service in the world. If I could give it a -10 rating I would. If a private business was run the way Canada Post is. It would have been out of business 100 years ago. Pathetic customer service because there union and no one cares or is held accountable. It's really a joke. If you haveca choice of who you ship with even if it cost three times the price. Ship with UPS, Fed Ex, Loomis, Purolator, Tom,Dick, Harry anyone but Canada Post."
"I ordered a small motorcycle part from France. It arrived with package damaged and taped up with an included adapter for the part missing. Canada post denied any wrong doing. Part supplier shipped out a replacement adapter even though it was not their fault. It was diverted from customs clearance to a ""Secure Holding Facility"" 60 miles away from me, held there for a almost a week with tracking update indicating everyday to wait 24 hours for update. Eventually called Customer Service. They indicated their status on the parcel showed it was ""undeliverable"" and the facility was preparing to ship back to sender in France. I asked them to retain it and find out what was wrong before sending back. I was going to drive there and pick it up. They said an investigation will happen and they will contact me in 3 business days. After 3 days with no call, I requested update and they had no new information and informed me the holding facility does not log the actual reason why its ""undeliverable"" and also that ignored my request to hold the part, they shipped the part back. Frustrating, cost me lots of money in the weeks lost waiting for part, over 3 hours of waiting on telephone holds, no answer as to what they did wrong or what caused part to be undeliverable. Finally I paid for company to ship me the now urgent part overnight using private carrier for entire delivery. I will not use Canada Post again for anything, nor recommend this unreliable, dishonest, incompetent cluster bung of a comnpany. It is no wonder they need to be protected by anti competition rules to barely stay in business, they have no competance to do it on merit alone. Disgusting"
"Canada Post has caused me huge stress and time. I had 2 packages that said they were delivered in the tracking details and they were not in my mailbox after checking numerous times. One of the packages was a birthday present and 1 was a reward from my work. Thanks a lot Canada Post for royally screwing this up!!! I opened tickets, called and they have no idea where my packages are. Make someone accountable for this!! Fedex seems to have it together and deliver my packages on time, maybe you should call them and get some pointers."
"Garbage Service, first they gave one delivery date then they suddenly change to new delivery date. I even paid for the delivery charges but still bad service"
"After spending hours on the internet locating a switch for a vintage reel to reel, over paying for the rare item, Travels from overseas, then Canada Post losses it locally. They should be replaced by Skip the Dishes, they haven't lost a meal yet"

"Worst service available on market ... I called them because i noticed that the parcel i was waiting for had missing information ""the app number was missing"" so on phone i was able to inform them about it and the lady made a stupid ""ticket"" .. i insisted a little and ask if she could contact the person doing the delivery in my area and she responded that she couldn't do that ... i then asked if they could retain my parcel at the postal office.. she responded that she couldn't do that ... so i asked is there a chance that they could fix the address and then make the delivery... she responded that it's not likely to happen that my parcel will be sent back to the sender and that he'll have to pay again to resend the parcel ...
What a stupid bunch of losers... every other mailing or delivery company can do better !! Canada post suck !! And they suck a lot !!"
"Canada Post is a very inefficient organization and it is completely useless. It lacks customer service. Why does it exist? It closed a nearby post office where my PO box was located without informing me. Due to this mess up, my parcel has gone back to the sender. What a service. I opened the ticket and they could not determine what was the resolution or even where the package was."
"CPC has the worst drivers in Sarnia Ontario.
the driver has the mailman deliver a card saying that he had been here at 7:41 AM. however I was on my porch at that time. Canada Post is getting worst than when I worked for them, that's why you can not get in touch with them. they hide behind their computer telephones"
If i could give negative stars i would. I finally received my package but they didn't put it in the mailbox or by my door or even on the porch. They threw it on the lawn down by the sidewalk. I didn't find it until 11pm that night after i saw that it was supposedly delivered. No need to worry about porch pirates with these guys they leave it for ANYONE to get
"This was the weirdest delivery experience ever. Not delivery, but losing my parcel. I live in student housing where I have my own mailbox and also a Canada post locker. First day I saw that the item was delivered so when I check my mailbox, I didn't get any parcel or Canadapost key. Next day I got the key to the canada post locker, but when I open the Canadapost locker, the locker was empty. I didn't tell them anything since I thought maybe they will put it in the locker later. Then I wasn't home the next 2 days and when I came back and called them about this issue, they said since it has been more than 72 hours, they can't do anything about it and I have to contact the sender directly. Next day I called them again and someone was kind enough to create a ticket. But it says if I didn't get my parcel within next 3 business days(which I didn't), then I will have to contact the sender). And so Canada Post lost my parcel without taking any responsibility for it!"
"if they had zero stars, that's the rating they should get. stop blaming the pandemic - a package from china gets to canada faster than canada post can get it 300 miles from where it enters. and make your tracking actually TRACK. not ""it's shipped"" then nothing.. tracking by it's nature is following progress and letting you know where it is. can only assume Canada Post doesn't WANT you to know. privatize them. can't possibly get any worse."
"The worst delivery service!!! Packages are always delayed and take forever to get to us. Expected delivery day always changes. Hire more people if you can not get packages out when they are expected to be delivered. I thought this could be a 1off experience, but every package from Canada Post is always delayed and takes forever to get here. I was suppose to receive my latest package on May 31st. It is now June 3rd and now says they are not sure when i will get it. Unacceptable!!
If you are using CP to ship a product please reconsider"
"If you are lazy,stupid or just a low IQ

My product has been sitting in the Canadian port for over a week and still has not been acquired by Canada Post ...I order several items online and this is the first time it has just sat there for a week to be picked up ...use literally ANY other provider to send items !!! Snail mail is right !! If I could have given 0 I would have!
"I regularly send mail from England to my son in British Columbia Canada üá®üá¶ it takes a day to get from my local post office in Coventry to Heathrow Airport, it leaves Heathrow later the same day,does a 12 hour fight to Canada 5000 miles away, it either lands at Toronto 4000 kilometres from my son or in Vancover 5 hours from my son,the Canadian postal service is fully automated and computerised,but the mail i have sent takes 3 to 4 weeks to arrive at my sons address, the mail goes through Canadian customs ok then sits for weeks in a sorting office, the Canadian Post person comes across very idol and extremely lazy."
"Been at the same place for 13 years & still, to this day, the letter carrier ""can't seem to put it at the right address"". Pitiful that they don't even check if it's at the correct address.

THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR WAY TOO LONG!!!

üò†"
Awful. Left a package at my door after I left instructions with Canada Post (called and online) to deliver it to the post office since I was not home. When I called customer service the agent was so defensive and rude. He said that my instructions were not guaranteed and can sometimes not be followed. I asked why and his response was that he was not a delivery agent and couldn't tell me. Are you not supposed to know about the workings of your company when you are in customer service? Never again...
"Worst experience of my life. They gave me my final notice and my first notice for package on the same day! The guy said they forgot to leave the notice, for a whole month. My package got sent back and the customer service told me to figure it out myself. Canada post is unreliable, unprofessional, and irresponsible."
"This happens more than it should. I had an item say its delivered, watched the truck come and go with no items, no slips, nothing. Dealing with their customer service is absolutely terrible. Now I have to play the waiting game to see where things went wrong on items that are very important to me."
"I ordered a box from USA that was delivered by Canada Post. I got no notification or anything stating that the box is delivered. When I checked the track number I discovered that it was delivered. I went to the nearest Canada Post to make sure . They said it was delivered. I called the Customer Services and I explained what happened. After investigating from their side, I discovered that the mail personnel did not bother himself to secure my box inside the building safely or even to knock my door to notify me as I was home when he came to the building and I opened the front door for him. I tried to reach ‚ÄúBryan‚Äù the supervisor and I left him 3 voice messages with no reply. My box got stolen or lost and they did not show any responsibility or professionalism as it was not my fault but theirs!!!!"
"I had something delivered to a friend with the CORRCT address on it. It took two week for it to arrive in their location when they told her 5 days. When it arrived at the post office in their location it stayed there for almost a week and then they shipped it back with no reasoning. When shipping it back they gave me an estimate of when it would arrive back at my house and it arrived week later than their estimated time. I understand that covid has an affect on postal services but 5 days is very different than almost 4 weeks.

If you ever mail anything please don‚Äôt use Canada post. They need serious help"
"Paid for priority 2 day shipping so I get a part to fix my AC for my family before leaving province for work. A waste of money. It will be at least 5 days by the time it arrives now. I should have drove the 100km and got it within the couple hours and saved some money. Now I not only wasted money on priority shipping, but I'll be out hundreds more to pay a hvac company to fix my AC"
Shipped and arrived at destination city at 4am yet didn‚Äôt get delivered. Now my live plants are sitting in a warehouse over the weekend. Thanks Canada Post!
Witnessed some disturbing costumer service bcnof mask mandates and not respecting peoples exemptions. Learn the actual bylaws
"Tracking info claims: expect delivery tomorrow > Wednesday. Next update: expect delivery Friday instead. Next update: expect delivery on Monday. This is now one week later than when the order was placed. This is a prescription I'm waiting on. Oh, my mistake, should have paid the extra $$$ for an expedited delivery. At least give me proper information about when I can expect to receive the package."
"I would rate Canada Post as -5 stars if possible. They have lost two parcels that had been shipped to me in the past three months, and l fear that a third parcel has been lost. They are beyond brutal, they are BRUTAL!! double exclamation mark.
The Chat Line is totally useless, as the 'Live Agent' tells you absolutely nothing, zero, zilch, nada. They never answer specific questions, such as - ""the item is tracked, so where is it now""; and, ""why have 3 expected delivery dates come and gone with no delivery""; and, ""why is there an added fee (substantial) for tracking when you cannot tell me information that tracking is supposed to provide"".
I wish that shippers would not use Canada Post when an international parcel arrives in Canada. I would pay extra to have it sent via UPS or DHL or Purolator when in Canada. Canada Post is a joke!"
"The most incompetent service with the most incompetent staff in the world. Let me just give you 3 examples in the past 6 months: (1) a letter never arrived the recipient; (2) A registered letter arrived after 2 months(I could have walked there to deliver it faster); (3) Another registered letter sent 69 days ago is still not received. Tracking indicates that it's still in transit. Note: both registered letters costed me over $20.00 each.

The honorable Doug Ettinger, Anita Anand and Jessica L. McDonald, Could you please fire all of them and hire a different staff with a clean slate please?"
"Worst service ever. Mail was sent as express and didn't leave Canada for 11 days. No reason for their delay, cannot track the mail number to see where it is now. Agents are not able to help as they don't know anything, you can't reach for a manager to explain what is going on. It it better to use private company as DHL in the futur."
I wish there was a review less than 1 star.
"Only giving 1 star because it wont let you give 0.
Canada post is literally one of the worst services ever created. I understand delays due to the pandemic and whatnot, but not to this insane extent. I've had a package I desperately needed for a birthday sit in one location 10 minutes from my house for 2 weeks without it going out for delivery. They wouldn't even let me just go and pick it up. Totally screwed over my plans and my day. Will always try to avoid using them when possible. Absolute trash."
"So many awful experiences with Canada Post. As someone who works in the import/shipping industry, I feel that there is no excuse for the incredibly poor service that they provide. It is expected that shipping delays may occur from time to time and I understand it has been tough for everyone throughout the pandemic however, it is 2021 and everything is done electronically through scans. There is no reason for their shipping information not to be updated. Whether it is delayed or not, the online tracking information should be accurate considering the packages are scanned every time they are moved/relocated. This pandemic is not a viable excuse for poor service and failed technology. I would suggest Canada Post reach out to FedEx, UPS or an alternate competitor to find out how they can provide better service for their Customers."
"I ordered a product I needed before my test for a class. The delivery date was between 21 - 27 May and my test was on the 27th of May. The package took 5 days to go from North York, Ontario to Mississauga, Ontario which is about a 30min drive and I live in NL :/. So now I will probably fail my test, thanks to Canada Post because it is now the 26th and my package is still in Ontario. I will forever think Canada Post is dog s**t."
"Canada post delayed my package for 4 days and I have been tracking it and waiting for it but it says we will tell you when we get the next date for the package delivery

Everytime there is a problem with my mail I call Canada post to open a service ticket. They either close it after a day or claim that they will have someone reach out to me and call me back. I have never been called back and my issues are never resolved through the costumer service.
"Ten days to get a parcel from vancouver to Prince George. I should have just driven the 8 hours and picked it up myself. Long weekend came and my plans failed waiting on poor service,"
"Today, I waited expecting a very important equipment. This morning it showed as our for delivery, then I got ‚Äúitem redirected to recipients new address‚Äù, (I haven‚Äôt moved), I was sitting outside having coffee. I received a notification on my phone ‚Äúfailed delivery attempt, notice card left‚Äù.

There was no card and no delivery attempt, I contacted Canada Post via the chat app and had my husband call them.
I asked how I could receive a failed delivery attempt notice when delivery was not attempted?

I was told ‚Äúdelivery hadn‚Äôt been attempted as a signature is required‚Äù, I stated again ‚ÄúI was here‚Äù and that none of my other ‚Äúsignature required‚Äù parcels actually required signatures.

i am amazed this is happening on a first world country."
"Hardly do they update tracking. They will ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to help you with customer service when in reality it‚Äôs just a bunch of ‚Äúloop-around‚Äù that get nothing.

Often times you will be forced to pay for tracking even though many times it will not even be updated until after the package has been delivered. Has happened to myself and family members multiple times.

Since Canada Post is a crown corporation they can essentially never go bankrupt which is how they get away with horrendous service. And they treat their employees terribly ‚Äî instead of hiring more employees they opt to overwork the few they have even during COVID."
I called Canada post for help an all they do is tell you the same old thing there rude when it comes to being on the phone with them I don‚Äôt like Canada post an I will not be use if this company anymore it keep extending the time my package is supposed to be here I‚Äôm not happy with Canada post at all very poor work they do
"Yep Canada post truly is a terrible over priced delivery co.$53 to ship 11.5 kg to Niagara falls from Medicine hat w/$300 ins.,been ten days and still not delivered,welcome to CanScamPost"
Ordered a package two months ago and have had to change the address since it has taken so much longer than the expected delivery date. And now it‚Äôs just stuck in storage and they can‚Äôt explain why it hasn‚Äôt moved in 3 weeks now. Beyond brutal experience.
"I frequently order packages and have never had any unreasonable delays or issues with any postal services OTHER THAN Canada Post. EACH and EVERY time that I had a parcel delivering with Canada Post it has been significantly delayed (at least 5-6x later than the initial expected delivery date). For recent online purchases I have made, once I realized it is shipping with Canada Post I have immediately cancelled the order.

Unless you are looking for a postal service that is exceptional at delivery packages well beyond the initial expected date with an incompetent tracking system than by all means go with Canada Post."
"Canada Post is the epitome of incompetent!
Today, I waited expecting a very important parcel. This morning it showed as our for delivery, then I got ‚Äúitem redirected to recipients new address‚Äù, (I haven‚Äôt moved), I was sitting outside having coffee.

I asked about the notice card that had been left, the employee stated ‚Äúyou should receive the notice card in a couple of days‚Äù.

(My husband was still on hold, due to high call volume)

Canada Post is pathetic, sadly they are one of the preferred shipping methods many businesses seem to choose. Maybe Amazon delivery drivers could teach Canada Post how to deliver parcels?

They deserve 0 out of 5 stars, their service standards keep getting lower, absolutely incompetent service."
"If there was an option for ‚Äò0‚Äô stars, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd give them. From regular mail delivery to receiving packages, absolute terrible service and business ethics. A mail carrier accidentally kicked over one of my pricy flower pots, forgivable, yet they refused to apologize or acknowledge it, even with proof. Ordered an NFL sweater at Christmas time. I have updates texted to my phone. I‚Äôm sitting in my front window, working from home, when I get a delivery notice... It wasn‚Äôt delivered to my house so I call Canada Post. The person I spoke to said they would look into it. Their delivery person assured them they delivered it. So the fact that there is nothing being delivered on my cameras is irrelevant? The NFL Shop was more than accommodating. They shipped a new sweater, rush delivery and used UPS. I had the replacement in my hands within 3 business days. I recently made a purchase from a USA based company. My package took longer to ship from Customs to my location (under 150km‚Äôs) than it did to ship across the USA (5000+km‚Äôs). My delivery date kept changing. I was assured my package would be delivered today, after a full 2 days of being ‚Äòout for delivery‚Äô. Imagine my surprise when I get a Delivery Notice Card with my regular mail. No package delivery was attempted. I now have a ticket number and am waiting to hear if they will ‚Äòre-attempt‚Äò to deliver a package that was never actually brought to my door. Save yourself the headache, ship with another company."
I moved to a new place last October...I put in 3 or 4 complaints over the next few months about my mail being just left in the lobby for anyone to take rather then put in my box. I finally got a call from a supervisor about it....explained it all again...didn't happen for the past 4 or so months...today we start the game again. Put mail in box. This is a job...you wouldn't think it would be that difficult.
"Canada Post has became the worst company ever seen in the entire world.Even third countries are faster, cheaper and more accurate according to all the bad experience I had with Canada Post for the last 12 months.This company is only thinking about making fortune, our shipped mail and parcels are taking months to arrive to their destination overseas.We are getting embarrassed and humiliated with by our buyers online because of the most disgusting and ignorance of this company who's selfish and careless. I've lost my patience and am praying that this soon to be retired once for good will be replaced by a better and more accurate foreign company. Even Zimbabwe post office is much more faster, cheaper and accurate. I do not,nor ever recommend Canada Post to anyone to conduct business with.

Extremely disgusting."
"Been waiting over a week for a package being shipped from a town 40 minutes away. Stuck on ""in transit""."
Ordered RC parts. Express post. Yeah right. No guarantee with covid. Forgot my unit number. Phoned CP undated it. Contacted CP today they said could take up to a week to get my 1 lb package. I can see the post office out my front window as I type this. I work for a shipping company. If I took a week to deliver a package less than a block. I'd get fired. Company's get discounted rates when using one shipping company. What your paying their are making $ off it. When ever possible I avoid Canada Post. Is it owned by the Government? This would explain alot.
"illogical that I HAVE to print a battery picture to send parcels that contains batteries in them. No, I can't just write the word ""batteries"" on it. No, Canada Post don't sell the pictures. Apparently the printer at my place is the only legitimate source for printing signs for dangerous goods. It is essential that I return home to print out a sign that doesn't even look like batteries to warn everyone that this parcel contains batteries"
"They never deliver to my door, always says attempted delivery and card left at the door which is a lie. I‚Äôm working from home and no note left at door. They don‚Äôt even attempt to deliver. I have to go pick it up at the nearest post office next day."
"Twice in a week, tracking # says delivered and guess what, nope! They want me to get the seller to resend it, and then they will reimburse the seller...as if! ZERO accountability!"
"Slow deliveries, and they don't listen when it comes to your selected delivery options. The people working at Canada Post are very rude, impatient and downright nasty on the phone... YOU SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR THE MEAN SPIRITED PEOPLE YOU HIRE!"
This is my second review they never deliver to my apartment even a small litter this is stupid they can leave it in the mailbox but they never.
My mom just died today because Canada Post delayed one of my mom's medication for her health. I was suppose to get it on friday because thats what it says on their tracking website. They delayed it for 4 days because they do not care anymore. Fk Canada post! My hatred for this company is beyond comprehension. I will always hate CanPost everytime i think of my mom. Rest in peace ma. Go to hell Canada post! Fk you!
"UPDATE, in advance: my package arrived today, June 4th -- a month and two days after the six days it took to get to Chicago in the hands of Canada Post. I'm upping my rating of Canada Post, properly and fairly, because I'm sure it was, except for a very brief time, solely the USPS that handled my parcel after it landed in The Windy City. Still, Canada Post could be a little faster in handling, even though they're exonerated from blame for losing my package. ; ]

Well, let me start by saying that with 95% of the more than 4,100 reviews here being 'Bad', it would appear that Canada Post doesn't care nearly enough about their service quality or public image. The company's performance can't be this broadly deplorable by mere luck of the draw.

I'm seeing reviews that are merely a day or a week old, and they're ALL negative. I had intended to wait until my package arrived before leaving a review, if I'd even decided to leave one. I changed my mind when I saw that my invisible traveler went from one to then two days past its expected delivery date, and further yet. The given delivery timeline was already almost 'unacceptable', noting the distance between points A and B, as the saying goes. This alert of even longer and indeterminable transit time was issued after many days of my parcel floating around with no tracking updates at all following its arrival in Chicago five days after being mailed. It has no projected time for reappearing on the radar, and I'm told in resignation to simply ""stay tuned for updates"". Isn't that the sole purpose of 'tracking'?

I live in New York State, near Albany. I HAVE had a couple of items over the last few years ship from Canada via Canada Post with no issues that come to mind as you would expect glaring mistakes and ineptness to do. My parcel has been handed over to the USPS, which lost a lot of credibility and respect this past Christmas season. At this point I don't know how much direct involvement Canada Post has. That said, the USPS tracking history only shows what Canada Post's site does -- an arrival in Chicago on May 2nd -- two weeks ago. My package was shipped by an Etsy vendor on April 27th. This seller is in Teeswater, Ontario. I 'Googled it', and a literal drive to pick up my order would have taken 473 miles and about nine hours one-way. The laughable COVID restrictions that we're under have been given and continue to get a lot of easy blame for postal delays, as well as for other disruptions of 'normal' living conditions.

In a funny twist, a Wikipedia page reveals early in its profile of the town of Teeswater, from where my item shipped, that the Post Office there dates from 1855. Maybe Canada Post is stuck in the days of America's Pony Express. ; ]

I'm sure that these delays are arguably 'First-World problems' in most cases, but they are still unacceptable by 2021 standards of living. They're greatly affecting commerce and customer satisfaction, and they shouldn't exist more than a year into this 'pandemic' morass. These people, as well as all other delivery companies, have had enough time to get their proverbial poop in a group in response to most if not all COVID upheavals. As I think I read in another astute review, Canada Post's ONLY job, in the final analysis, is to get packages from a point of origin to a destination. COVID can't be ascribed that much blame for Canada Post's inconceivable number of unexplained failures between acceptance and wildly delayed final delivery of items. An actual current location of my package would be enough to satisfy me at this point, even if it's just languishing at a hub, especially in light of how many complaints I've read about packages going from being delayed to missing altogether -- some with 'delivery confirmation'. : /

In fairness, I don't work in that thankless industry, so I don't know what a day in the trenches is like. Also, to reiterate, The USPS majorly stubbed its toe this past Christmas season, but I think they've regained balance. Opinions and mystery aside, I wait for updates as instructed. ; ]

All said, it DOES feel like it did when I was a kid in the late '70s, waiting a month for skateboard parts to arrive from California via UPS. ; ]"
Worst delivery company in canada. Pay for express shipping and it takes longer then basic delivery. Screw this company
ANOTHER LOST PACKAGE.TRACKING NUMBER SHOWS IT WAS PICKED UP AND NOTHING AFTER THAT.ITS BEEN 3 WEEKS FOR AN IN SAME PROVINCE DELIVERY .WORST SERVICE ON THE PLANET.INCOMPETENT AND UNORGANIZED!!!!!!!
I sent a letter express post on April 16th to Delta BC..clearly written and it was sent to the US. Sorting error? Well it was lost until May 14th. It was time sensitive and this kind of error should not have happened. The postal service has become a joke. This is the fourth time they have screwed with my life. They have one job to do and they aren't even qualified. It used to be such a prestigious service. They suck! Will never ever go through them again and everyone knows how crappy they are. Their reputation is crap!
Very unsatisfactory on getting things delivered. They are slow at getting parcels out the door. The delivery lady is awesome. I try not to send through canada post.
"paid for xpress and to this day i still dont have my package , it was supposed to be at my door and it wasnt , they then said they left a notice card that WAS NOT there . i went out of my way to call the support line and they told me it would be there today at 1 in a post office , end up it wasnt and now they dont know where it is."
Amazon can deliver packages in 2 days.... Canada post will delay your package many days...... think its time canada post steps up or shuts down. Every single time I deal with canada post.... delay...delay... massive fee now owed... delay... horrible customer service wait time for horrible customer service. They do realize they have 1 star reviews cuz they suck and use excuses for their workers not doing their jobs. Mebe they have been around too long and just need to stop being around at all. They don't want to be here it shows with how they never deliver items on time and us people are starting to not want them around neither. New world. Let's find better ways then canada post lazy ways . Again. Amazon can get a package from China to your house in Canada in a couple of days. Canada post takes weeks to if it ever shows who knows .
I sent a small parcel from Toronto to Hamilton (1 hour drive apart) via Expresspost and was told it would be there on Tuesday. It is now Thursday and I just found out it is somewhere in New Brunswick. Each time I call Canada Post the supposedly do a ticket but I never receive anything in my email and nobody can tell me when it will be delivered. This was urgent. Don't ever use Expresspost if you need the item there by a certain date. Last time I used them was in 2018 and the items was late then. Regular mail is faster.
"this company is a scam company. they are charging people money when they don't even show up and deliver. this needs to be mass reported by the public so we can finally have some change happen.
COMPLETE SCAM DO NOT TRUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Terrible company. I've been waiting for this package for a month now. It's a car part, so I can't even take my car on the road. The seller is just south of the border. I was supposed to get it within a week. They had it at the border in two days, but unfortunately they handed my package to useless crapanada post. Three weeks of checking daily, ( I talked to them and they were very relaxed in saying""oh, that's nothing, around a month of waiting time is normal"" üòê. I thought what?guys in the old west got their mail faster than this on a horse. If there's a virus going on either hire more people, have better measures in place or just close your doors so people will use competent delivery companies) before it finally updated and said that apparently I need to pay 65 dollars to have it released from the border. That was last week. Paid that too, and then nothing.I feel sorry for myself and anyone else who has to put up with this horrible, garbage company.ü§¨ Hopefully I get my package by the end of may. Or the summer. Or the year...at this point I wouldn't be surprised if they update their system as returning to sender."
"I was at home when the driver delivered only the notice to say ""we missed you"". I opened the door and he was still infront. He did not have the package on him. He said his job is to deliver the notice only and my package needs to be picked up from postal office due to Covid. So in their eyes, it's better for a customer to go into a postal office with 30 other people where the chances of you getting covid is 30x higher, than to deliver the package to my door.

This only happens with CanadaPost. I have never had this issue with any other companies. Please avoid this company as much as you can."
"The case of the revolving clock. It is now a month plus since my package will be delivered in 1 to 12 days. It took USPS 2 days to get it to Canada. Unfortunately, they handed my package to Canada Post.

In the end, it is not Canada Post's fault. Mail and Package delivery is not their core strength. Neither is customer service, web interfaces or ""taking pride in one's work.""

I feel sorry for myself to be stuck with Canada Post."
It‚Äô my fault to trust this company to send a valuable staff just 4 hours away from my home. It is the worst company I see ever.
"I spoke with a lady today within the virtual chat her name was Rachel and her employer name was 8001901. I have never encountered such an unprofessional, rude and unhelpful lady.
I ask her a question, and she proceeds with attitude replying with ""excuse me"". I asked to speak with a manager and instead of helping me she said just call customer service and request them.
my package was supposed to come in today showing ""out for delivery "". I checked after a few hours and it says a notice has been left. I check outside there is NOTHING OUTSIDE. THERE WAS NOT EVEN AN ATTEMPT TO DELEIVER MY PACKAGE. If your too lazy to do your job then don't do it at all. I understand were in a pandemic SO UPDATE THE GODDAMN WEBSITE AND STATE THAT THEY NO LONGER LEAVE NOTICES OR DO ATTEMPTS TO DELIEVER!!!!!!! ONLINE it stated, if duties are not showing up in their system they will require confirmation number at the door, and no agent decided to deliver the parcel instead take the easy way out and drop it off somewhere else.

I ALWAYS have issues with Canada post, they loose my packages and are not helpful at all. I WISH I COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT DELEIEVRY SYSTEM. FEDEX OR UPS IS 1000000 TIMES BETTER. I will never choose this company for any of my deliveries, and please hire more educated and professional agents. DISRESPECTIFUL."
"How is it possible that a small parcel can be with Canada Post on May 5 to be on route to be delivered by May 10....By checking on May 11 the same parcel has been received on May 10 to be delivered on May 21.
What's going on?"
41 days and still counting what a garbage Service a parcel arrived to canada and no sign of when it will be delivered HEY CANADA STOP THIS JOKE
"Have a parcel arrived from China two weeks ago and still hasn't been processed for delivery. Not acceptable, so appalled by the speed of their service as it took less time to arrive from China, and has spent more waiting to be processed, and posted to me."
So I got scammed on a package. The piece of crap who scammed me sent me a fake paypal email that was really believable. I ended up sending the package but realized 10 minutes after that it was a scam. I ran back to the post office thinking there is no way my package could have been picked up yet. I go to find out that it has been picked up and that there is almost no way for me to get my package back. The fact that they don‚Äôt have a way of marking a package that is tracked as send back to owner is unbelievable. How can a billion dollar company not have proper security. All that has to be done is mark the package as send back through the bar code. Every single xpresspost package is tracked and scanned at every stop along the way. My package was in the hands of at least a dozen people but nobody is able to see on their screen that it is fraudulent mail. Pathetic company with pathetic service. If anyone knows of a company that has correct security and would be able to return my package if anything ever happened like this that would be great. Avoid Canada post until they get this issue resolved. If you mess up with the address or anything like that. Expect to lose the package and the money you spent to ship it.
Wow if stupidity was a commodity Canada Post delivers each and every time.i ordered something from Oshawa Ontario on April 13.its now may 10th. I live in Windsor Ontario that's only 415.8kms away.seriously can any there read a map ya only need on road to be on not to screw it up 401 west bound.but it gets better cause now my parcel is missing.some how from the point of origin to the Oshawa post depot so it could continue its journey well now it's disappeared.customer service a joke 2hours on hold no resolution and each call the person can hardly speak English!! What a joke.and what's amazing is each time there contract is up they want more money! Hey Justin SCREWDEAU sort out your post office pal.its a dismal failure that comes at the cost of the tax payers and thats us we deserve better
"It happens all the time the delivery is quick, but they leave my parcels in my lobby without ringing my bell and there are over 120 apartments and they just leave it there in the lobby, small parcels big parcels
anybody can take them. Please ring my bell and it‚Äôs written on my package to ring my bell, but they are not doing that anymore. I will look for other carriers available next time."
"Do not use their service! They only going to take your money. I sent a letter international, and my receiver didn't get it because it has a problem with the address. I tracked it they say it will return to the sender. As I was chatting with a Canada post agent asking if I can refund the money that I paid (which is $94.37), they say they wont going to refund it, for the reason that it is my responsibility to complete the address that I sent. Seriously?? After I paid too much for the insurance and everything, they wont be going to refund my money! This is the service we got from them, you're expecting they will be going to give you a good service, after all the money we paid! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!"
"Avoid Canada Post at all cost and especially their XpressPost, they charge you for that and there is no service. Do not use their signature required service, they will just bring your package to a post office and then you have to pick it up just the next day after 1pm....there is no customer service, they cannot contact the driver even if the matter is very important. NO CANADA POST FOR ME OR MY FAMILY ANYMORE, really garage crown company and no CUSTOMER SERVICE, NO HELP, WASTE OF TAX PAYERS MONEY TO HELP THIS CROWN CORP."
"Terrible service, I don't recommend this company to anybody."
"If your thinking of going to Work for Canada Post think twice.  


If you become disabled they dont provide accommodations or requirements and needs met for workplace accommodations for employees with disabilities aged 25 to 64 years


They treat you like ?????,  they tell you to come back to work without Dr note.  THAT what I was told my HR and my Team Lead.  I'm not mentioning name but it was from Head Office in Ottawa."
"There should be an option of 0 stars.
Horrible service and can't even speak or send email to someone. Online chat is off too. Expensive ($11 for 200g package from Squamish to Vancouver), unreliable, late .... They are lucky I am not their CEO."
"Order not delivered in time for the occasion, initial poor response however, ** my complaint was resolved, and grievance is with carrier (Canada Post), mum liked the card"
"I been waiting for my package from Canada Post ,I order in Feb and April , so I call then and. What going with my package, they told me it's been delivered or stolen it , I been waiting every day, I get call back from Canada, Post saying they found it and are returning it sender, I watch a Canada Post worker pull to there vehicle and put packages in there vehicle üò°"
"I had a package shipped on April 16 with a delivery date of April 23 - 30. Here it is May 6, and nothing! I'm supposed to be patient because of COVID, but I see they have time for maskless retirement parties in the middle of COVID. Instead of partying in the middle of a pandemic then blaming the pandemic for their snail-paced service, why don't they learn how to move an object from point A to point B?"
Canada Post sure knows how to host COVID-19 spreading employee retirement parties at their Gateway plant in Mississauga. No wonder mail delivery becomes slowed down.
"They should not be offering xpresspost at this time. I‚Äôm on week 2 of waiting, when I paid for 2 day shipping.

They can‚Äôt really blame covid because other delivery services have their stuff in order and are operating fine."
Do NOT ever update your preferences for delivery or it adds innumerable days to when you MIGHT receive your package. Horrible service and can't even speak to someone about things without massive dancing through options over the phone.
Anything i order from Canada Post arrives late and is held up in Halifax with the explanation ‚Äúdelayed due to external factors‚Äù. I even get the ‚Äúdelayed due to external factors‚Äù before my product even makes it to Halifax lol. I avoid using Canada Post as much as possible.
"Canada post is a joke. I ordered something from lids Canada with Canada next business day shipping for an extra $35. The lids warehouse is in mississauga, I live in Burlington. It was ready to ship on Monday, its now Wednesday and xpresspost hasn't even picked up the package yet. I spoke to rep at can post and she tells me my package is in customs and until it's released they can tell me when I'll get it. She tired to tell me a package from mississauga is in customs. I showed her the messages from lids confirming everything I ordered came from the mississauga warehouse and it's not in customs. She responded saying, no its an American company so it's in customs.

Then another rep takes over and says it's going to take 3 - 5 business days then leaves the chat.
I'm not surprised at the atrocious customer service and incompetence, it's a government business that unionized.

I ordered 2 things on Sunday from lids with 3-7 day shipping as well and they used a different parcel delivery company who delivered my purchase today so its not lids fault at all, they've already refunded the 35 for shipping. It's canada post and their xpresspost scam.
Canada post should be cut off from our tax dollars and go bankrupt and close for good. The private sector delivery services are more reliable, efficient and have great customer service."
"Very unreliable!
Parcels go missing very often and customer service is a waste of time.
Just had a parcel missing and after almost 30min waiting for customer service it was useless; not even an attempt to make amends.
No wonder why there are always rumours about it going bankrupt.
Do yourself a favour: use the other companies instead."
"If I could give 0 I would. What do the delivery people actually do? I was supposed to get 2 separate deliveries this week. In the tracking system is says they were delivered, when in reality they were NOT. I am at home all day, no notice no nothing. Trash."
"Terrible customer service at the Surrey Central Mall.
They act as though they are doing you a big favour, by doing their jobs. This is not INDIA, this is not a third world country, if people think they have the right to be obnoxious because they are providing a service, then they belong in a third world hellhole."
"The mail forwarding service was horrible! I've bought the service but you couldn't forward any mail and failed doing so, made all of my Ids gone missing, like driver license, health card, permanent resident cards, the service Is too bad, horrible and Is just horrendous."
"Never been a huge fan of Canada Post to begin with but since covid has hit I'm surprised they are not just shut down completely.
I can't figure out how I'm getting notifications that my items are delivered but there's nothing in my mailbox.... I've got a parcel key but the box is always empty and no one from Canada Post can explain this..... I continuously having other people's mail that is not mine put in my mail box!! As far as I'm concerned Canada Post has cost me thousands of dollars!
Can someone help me make sense of the fact that I can order something internationally and it is shipped and received in Canada within a week but as soon as it hits Canada Post I'm waiting 3 to 4 months if I'm lucky to receive the item I ordered.....
If I had the option to NEVER use Crappy Post again I wouldn't!
*Calgary, AB"
"Was getting a package from Toronto picked from Canada Post April 12. Allow 5-10 business days. April 16th, arrived in Ottawa. April 19th 'out for delivery by end of day' April 20th, now it just says 'out for delivery- delayed.' I created a ticket, and it now says "" out for delivery"" 'your item still on the way"". Get your crap together !!!!!!"
Had something delivered by Canada post and they left it in the community mail box with the key parcels. They gave me the wrong key so now I have no clue where my package is and who has the key for it. Canada post is absolutely the worst when it comes to delivering packages. My frustration levels when it comes to them is crazy. They have one job to do and they can never do it right.
I wanted to order a shirt online that cost 45$ and you guys charge me an extra 20$ for shipping yeah no thanks you guys suck no wonder amazon Is way better
Even one star is too much. Shame on post Canada. It‚Äôs biggest official scam company.
"Canada Post delivered a large box from LeCreuset today. Expensive cookware.

The delivery agent was nice enough to move a Muskoka chair on our porch and hide the box behind it. Big thanks for the extra effort."
"Every time I have a package touched by Canada Post it somehow disappears. The newest package was delivered quickly and visibly by the US postal service until it was delivered to Canada Post, then it disappeared!! When you attempt to contact any part of the Canada Post delivery chain you meet dead ends and disconnected phone numbers. For a business that looses 200 million a quarter you have to question why taxpayers continue to front this bill. Debacle comes to mind."
"I sent a package to England and the postage was $22.49. I sent this on March 4, 2021 and it still has not arrived as of April 30, 2021. If I had put tracking on this package the cost of it would be astronomical and far exceed the value of the goods. The package was for my cousin and contained a card that I had made for her. I am a senior and cannot afford the prices Canada Post charges. It occurs to me that with so many complaints here we have the makings of a Class Action law suit. I have had previous negative experience with Canada Post and wrote to the Director - a woman - in Ottawa and received no reply. This is not the way to conduct a business. In addition, over the years the cost of sending Christmas cards has accelerated to the point where people can no longer afford to stay in touch at Christmas time. I used to send about 30 cards overseas and now the cost of just sending 4 cards is ridiculous. We can thank Canada Post for estranging families via their horrendous service and outrageous costs."
"what a horrible customer service experience.
I went to pick up my package that i send to my work and the shipment had duties on it.. the customer service was horrible and i hope no one have to go through what i went through. the rep at the location refused to see any information i had for this package and told me to go to HR to get a letter to prove that i work there even thou I had my work ID with me and prof online that i work at the location. she wanted it in hard copy and if i don't she will return my package and she did. Now i am out of money for shipping both ways after my package cost me $309.49 and now i have to pay return charges on this package. What type of customer service is this when i work for there sister company that they own. I am so disappointed of my experience. I send a customer complaint in hoping that they do something about it. Complaint # 141027633"
SO BAD> OMG? I dont even understand how. If i had any say id shut you guys down.
"Won't even send shipping notice then after you're done listening to some loser on the phone they tell you you have to wait another day even though your item is already in town, thats ridiculous and I wish these goofs would be nailed to a cross"
Lawsuit needs to be filed. Keep track of all you‚Äôre ‚Äúmissing‚Äù packages. Canada post employees are thieves.
"Stupid to the power of 10. In order to ship a pkg to the US you must first navigate their terrible website which struggles with us zip codes. After filling out all the info, they supply a bar code for the label. When you go to their counter, they totally ignore the said bar code you supply and are not technically able to get the information from the bar code untill you repeat all the info in person. Too stupid to get the answers asked by scanning the code. Stupid to the core!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Worst postal service I have ever experienced. I am from New Zealand and have waited over 2 months on 2 Occassion for a parcel to arrive.
Strasburg @ Shoppers Drug Mart - Only 1 employee and tons of people. Waited over 40 minutes in line during covid. Horrible service.
If I could give this company a cero start I would do yourself a favor and use FedEx or UPS I have lost 550.00 in packages to this company they are allowing drivers to steal. I will never use this service again. You can‚Äôt find any help no one knows anything and there is no customer service. Terrible indeed just stay awayü§¨
"Was supposed to receive a package by the 20th.. The package was sent on the 16th.. It is now the 26th... I literally might as well have picked up the package myself.. o wait but no.. they said because of covid I cant go to the warehouse to pick it up even though they are going to leave me a notice to go pick it up somewhere anyways.. which is going to take another day.

Update: it has now been over 10 days. I still have not received my package and there has been no update.."
"My past experiences-Lost expensive item...broken, damaged goods...read these reviews. Yup. I have to send an important document later. I will FedEx it"
"They somehow manage to lose parasols quick often. They‚Äôre very good at that.
Also no way to pay your duties and taxes online or over the phone, which is not convenient specially during Covid"
"Do not ship wit Canada post
Becaz ur receivers will never get it

They‚Äôre expensive nd not reliable
All their employees need to fire nd replace

Canada post I need a refund
DS"
"I live in an apartment, and your incompetent, lazy driver just tossed my package into the hallway, rather than knocking on my door. I was home the entire time. If they were able to get into the building, they were more than capable of knocking on my door. There is no excuse for this. I‚Äôm lucky it didn‚Äôt get stolen."
"Absolutely terrible, stay far away from what they describe as Xpress shipment, it‚Äôs snail mail. I was informed 3 day, right now it‚Äôs estimated to be min 7 days from shipment to delivery. Lethbridge to Thornhill Ontario, come on guys"".......you should be ashamed of charging $22 for a regular small letter size shipment when it‚Äôs no faster than regular mail."
"Canada Post can't even deliver mail to community mailboxes. One of my neighbours brought a letter (actually a bill) to my address, This neighbour lives around the corner and up the street, a totally different address and community mailbox. Thing is I never had this problem before these community mailboxes. This has happened several times. Canada Post is terrible at follow through with complaints. Like some reviews have said"" how does this company continue and increase their costs"". Terrible terrible terrible. Is that clear enough for you Canada Post?????????"
"Canada post has really declined this past year!! Will no longer be sending any packages with them! 3 times now I have sent something xpress post with a guarantee of three business days. All of the packages were at least 5 business days!
So incredibly disappointing, especially when Fed Ex and Purolator honor their delivery times.
Canada Post really needs to reevaluate their dedication to their customers.
So very sad!"
"Due to Covid, drivers are not required to obtain signatures on residential deliveries. We had a bad issue on April19 where the driver scanned 3 parcels however only delivered 2. We immediately contacted Canada Post and had a ticket opened up. Upon the investigation they interviewed the driver & the driver claimed 3 parcels were delivered when in fact it was only 2. Because a signature is not required this has opened a window for theft. Not to long ago a postal worker had a garage full of parcel's from online orders, Amazon, E-Bay etc. With the Covid pandemic this has made online ordering more popular than ever. Drivers should be wearing masks and the receiver should be wearing masks and obtaining signatures. Shame on Canada Post Management to allow this type of flaw. Drivers can be dishonest which some are and taking advantage of this situation. In our case all Canada Post said was you received 3 items which is not true but on there electronic scan system it protects this flaw. Please be aware some drivers are taking advantage and stealing which is a federal crime. However the flaw in the system not requiring signatures has opened up a huge opportunity to steal. Canada Post go back to your old way make drivers wear masks and get signatures do the right thing. Very disappointed in Canada Post."
"Absolutely terrible service . Over 4000 reviews with 95% giving a terrible rating , 2 % giving poor . They have done nothing to improve service . What other company with these ratings would keep the upper management performing like this ??"
"I have been living at my address for 10 years and apparently they don't understand that if you put your apartment number on the second line, as per some company‚Äôs address requirements, then they return the item to sender. Common sense should have come into play but apparently is too much to ask for from Canada Post"
Package has been in my town for three days. Was sent out for delivery three days ago. Has yet to arrive. Absolutely garbage service. Had a package get to town today and it came today and they left it on the ground in the yard
"I didnt even want to give 1 star but i had to in order to send a review....so i get an email saying my parcel is out for delivery, im home so i watch out for the mail carrier, later that morning i see the mail carrier passing my house, holding a white parcel, i checked my mailbox as soon as i seen her walk by.....NOTHING in my mailbox....a min later i got another email saying parcel was delivered.....i checked my front step back step everywhere....NOTHING. So i call the post office,and told her i seen the mail carrier walk by my house.....and did not drop my parcel off..... she said ‚Äúo il see if i can get a hold of her on her cell‚Äù....10 min later same 1 at the post office calls me and says ‚Äúi cant get a hold of her‚Äù....i told her that this happened many times b4.......2 hrs later i call the post office back....‚Äù the same girl i was talking to tells me this.....‚Äù the mail carrier didnt deliver mail up in your area yet today.....UNREAL, lying to me covering up for the mail carriers incompetence.....i seen the mail carrier with my OWN eyeballs no one elses eyeballs, i paid money out my pocket to have MY parcel here today.......i think Canada Post needs to do a complete overhaul on there employees......IM BEYOND PISSED."
"I understand that we are in the midst of a pandemic and our postal service is under a lot of pressure to deliver a really high volume of mail but Canada Post wasn't reliable before the pandemic either! Canadians are forced to pay INSANE postal prices (which is hitting small businesses really hard!). They've lost 5 of my packages over the course of a month and take 0 responsibility for it!!! They said if for any reason, packages were undeliverable that they would return to me, and NOTHING. Its been 3 months now and still no package, I've lost so much money as a small business owner because of Canada Post. Why do I have to pay $17 to ship a 6x10 mailer within my own country!? WHY!!?"
"Should be out of business LONG TIME AGO!
There's nothing worse than Canada Post!"
Doesn't get worse than this. Always shoving my big and unfoldable items in the very small box although there are a lot of larger boxes right there!!! The mailperson doesn't care at all and most of my valuable items got damaged because of such a stupid mistake!!! Consistently terrible customer service.
"This is 3rd package lost by Canada Post, I understand the times we are living in (Covid) but then if your not equipped to function contact these businesses and advise them of such and let the customers choice other means of delivery"
1 star is too much they lost me 1 of 1 signed Lebron james picture and apparently delivered it to a house not even in their delivery region and made very little efforts to get it back and were rude on the phone I paid 60$ shipping for them to loose my item never use this company almost like they did it on purpose cause of how little ‚Äú info‚Äù they had about such a bad experience
"Unfortunately for me being human, I have lost my package, I was in a hurry and filled my prepaid box and sealed it up and dropped it, as it was going down, I thought, I forgot to address it. I have the receipt for the box but no, they can not not help me, my package is now garbage. So very sad, and sad that there is no compassion or no solutions from Canada Post."
If I could give less stars I would every time I deal with these clowns it‚Äôs a whole other ordeal it‚Äôs delivering packages not brain surgery but I get it‚Äôs tough to do a job you only do everyday! Worst service and customer service if possible use carrier pigeons to ship packages you will have a better shot at getting it where it‚Äôs going on time. Companies a joke end of story
"I remember Canada Post putting Bill boards up to save house to house delivery and all the other propaganda just to tear jerk a government grant to secure extra funds. Yet the prevailing reason why Canadians don't trust Canada Post could be that they don't actually deliver door to door. Yet again another delivery was ""attempted"" without ringing a doorbell or knocking. Just a hastily written note left behind saying I wasn't home even though I caught the tail end of the driver rushing back to the truck(no delivery in hand) and speed off."
"For a company that goes door to door they damn sure have no clue where I live since I truly believe you don't have to have a working brain to work in the postal service!
Please do Canada a favor and GO OUT OF BUSINESS, Your bosses and workers should be upsizing my fries cause their to stupid to handle any other job that requires a working brain!
DUH!"
"honestly wish I could rate lower. When you pay for express shipping (2-4 days) on a package, a week in advance before you need it to go out of town, you should get it at least a few days before you leave, but no here I am with my package literally processed in my own city and I have to wait until Monday for someone to get off their ass and bring it to a mailbox for probably the 8th time, so sick of this company never living up to its delivery standard, you check it once a day for 3 days and it delays every time you check it, NEVER I REPEAT NEVER PAY FOR EXPRESS SHIPPING WITH THIS COMPANY AND NEVER EXPECT PACKAGES TO BE DELIVERED ON TIME"
"Overnight to travel 3 provinces, then 6 days from wpg to me, consistently the worst shipping company ever"
"By far the worst courier service in Canada. Not reliable, customer Service is inconsistent and rude. So they recently increase their shipping prices and removed their delivery guarantee. How does that make any sense. Added that they also damage your packages and they blame businesses and shippers for their complete lack of responsibility. Are you blaming the shipper for using your service?? Furthermore, if my package has been damaged by your irresponsible staff whom throw packages around and i paid insurance on that package, then why would you not honor that insurance and why is it only valued at $120 meanwhile the value of my package maybe higher. So in other courier companies when you pay insurance they ask you the value of your item and based on that if your item is damaged by them they pay you the value of your package. Meanwhile all the professionals in Canada Post, will blame you for using their service claiming and i quote ""Every Person is entitled to send mail through Canada Post"", supposedly and if my package does not comply with your shipping policy why do you still accept it and then damage my product, causing me a complete loss and then finally you do not honor my insurance claim?? How can you call your self a respectful company when you keep hurting small businesses that you so rely on.
Canada Post have been failing us every year especially during Christmas time. How can you claim professionalism when you keep having delivery issues every year in Christmas? Do you now know when Christmas is? it comes every year at the same time, yet you have been inconsistent in your services every year. What is your excuse?
In respectful companies, you are evaluated on yearly basis on your performance. You as a cooperation has underperformed consistently and no-one is being held accountable. WHY? we pay for a service that is not existent. We are better off revamping this Canadian service provided and starting from scratch as Canada Post has become toxic and outdated and has been stagnant for years and the only person suffering is the customer."
"They are getting worse , as my parcels arrive at the Post Office as I track all of them and they end up sitting there for sometimes 4 days or longer , Amazon is better , not happy with them CP I have heard even Postal Carriers are mad as Customers complain to them"
If I can give them ZERO star I will horrible service always loosing packages I have been dealing with them for a lost package since December horrible customer service always same answer (some one will call you back we are sorry) I am so sorry Canada post exist people choose another method of shipping üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
Terrible. Doesn't get worse than this. Always losing packages. Consistently terrible customer service.
"Canada post is the absolute worst delivery service out there. It's ridiculous. I have a package coming that needs a signature. They ""Attempt a delivery"" and tell me that they left a slip at my door. I've been home all day and have not had a knock at my door. I go to the door, no slip. They left a slip in my public mailbox. I talk to customer service to see why they did not knock on the door. They tell me that they are not knocking on doors because of Covid... But this is what makes ZERO sense... Why would they send my package out for delivery when it needs a signature, when they CAN'T get my signature anyways? Then it just goes through their whole route with no chance of it being delivered, and adds days of delay until I can actually pick up my package. Why would they not bypass the delivery truck and just let me go pick it up? It makes absolutely no sense. No other delivery company has this poor of service."
My mail man is such a crook he wont do anything for deliver mail until after 1pm and he has even kept some of my packages the cock sucker id like to get him fired
"Tried to intercept a fraudulent package the morning after we shipped it out and they couldn't come through. Terrible service, especially with how difficult things are right now for small business. Do better Canada Post, we will no longer be using your services."
"Useless custom service and customer requests are not taken into consideration. Took 1 month+ to investigate international package issue (address), very important medication was sent back. 3 months lost ( 1 month shipping to Canada, 1 month sitting in Canada Post 20 km from my place, now it sent back - will take another 1 months). Lazy workers, useless customer service (gave me different answers every time I contacted them, finally told me I will get package next day and yet 2 days after I see in tracking it's being sent back). What a waste of time, resources and nerves. Worst company ever!"
"canada post supports porch pirates!

they didn‚Äôt ring my doorbell or knock when dropping off my parcel worth $300+ product inside. however when i go to make a claim that it was stolen the bitchy front counter women at the yale canada post just told me to call a robot and make a claim, and that only led me on a robot phone call for 25 minutes that got me absolutely no where. i feel scammed and screwed. go to hell canada post"
"an absolute embarassment, they can never meet their delivery deadlines, late all the time , no accountability, lazy mail men who do crappy job cannot be fired.

All in all its a horrible company"
"I have been waiting for special letters
One from Picton ont and the other from Oakville I still haven‚Äôt got any mail
These were mailed to me on Mar 2/21
And I still have not either letter here in Welland I maybe see our mailman once a week what does the mailman do the other days. Service sucks Find my letters get rid of the postal service
They want us to buy stamps coins stuff from the Canada post why they can‚Äôt even deliver my mail it‚Äôs going to 2 months"
Crap service I paid for xspress post witch is 1-3 days and they took a week
"I feel compelled to write this review, as Canada Post's lack of competency, customer service, lack of values is increasingly infuriating me! My family live overseas and for Christmas and birthdays due to COVID I have to rely on Canada's postal system to ship gifts.

Is is expensive enough as it is to ship, but to ask for an additional $20 plus for tracking is unaffordable, but saying that, even if one pays for this service, you cannot get updates once it has left Canada - blame COVID you say!

I ask the counter clerk, if I pay you more money to ship how long will it take to get there, response - 1-2 weeks! What an absolute downright lie, it takes months. I am sending my gifts 2 months in advance, and still it takes longer than this. Canada Post you are taking money by stealth! It is criminal that you are taking money for shipping, which takes months and months to get there, and yet you take no responsibility whatsoever for your incompetence . you say - blame COVID! However, when my family ship parcels to me - it takes no more than 10 days, so it is clear the blame lies with Canada Post, or is it that COVID is not happening around the world, is COVID just in Canada?

You have caused me so much distress with my family not receiving their birthday gifts and cards in time. You have no idea how incompetent you really are. I am sick to death of paying extortionate postal rates, for no postal system.

However, let me say that that pre-COVID you were still the worst postal system ever. There needs to be a public inquiry into your operations, or should I say, lack of operations. I wish that you had a competitor because believe me I would never use your postal service ever again!"
"Garbage company. Used to care about customers and take pride in their work, now they are offering such poor service they are literally driving their customers to their competitors. This has been going on LONG before COVID. I now cancel ANY order which will be delivered by CP just on the assumption they will mess it up."
"Terrible service! My appartment building has 6 canada post lockers, but they just dropped my parcel to a shopping mall. In the middle of the Pandemic of the Century. My request to be dropped off at a location outside of the shopping mall was just closed without anybody notifying me about it.
They don't redeliver. Never ever will i accept anything that comes through canada post. I will make a point checking"
"On December 24, 2020, a Canada Post employee whose name I have, at the retail location inside First Canadian Place in Toronto, picked up a box and threw it at me after first refusing assistance regarding a package that Amazon had told me to bring to this location.

The employee swore at me and literally picked up a heavy box and shoved it/pushed it at me when I explained that Amazon told me to bring it to this location and had provided me with a shipping label.

When he refused to accept it, he said he doesn‚Äôt work for Amazon and that they don‚Äôt know what they are doing, that Amazon says lots of things that aren‚Äôt true, and so in, but when I told him I had no way to take the package back as someone had helped me bring it to this location and they had left right away, I explained I would have to leave it there and call Amazon.

I left the store and the employee yelled At me outside the store entrance, swearing at me saying ‚ÄúMerry (expletive) Christmas to you.‚Äù

I called Amazon and they apologized and dealt with it, however this does not excuse the actions of the employee. The exchange is on video surveillance from inside the store location, which is a stand alone retail store, not part of any convenience or other store.

After contacting Canada Post and filing a detailed complaint, I received a voicemail from the area manager, Sam, who had no idea what the situation was. He left me a voicemail with no way to reach him, and just the general number in order to track the package, which was already in the hanss of Amazon by this time.

After contacting Canada Post again multiple times via email to issue a complaint, each time the response from the organization was dismissive or made promises for someone to call me but they never did. When I finally spoke with the area manager, I did not know the voicemail that had been left for me before was the same person, as I had spoken to many people along the way.

Since he didn‚Äôt leave any specific contact information in the voicemail so that I could speak with him again, I didn‚Äôt think much of it when we finally spoke when I called and worked my way to a depot to find out where my complaint was at, and I hadn‚Äôt connected the voicemail to him until shortly after our call, and I discovered that luckily I had saved the actual voicemail still.

In the 30 second voicemail, there is no mention about the fact the employee did this, other than to say that he would speak with the employee.

Canada Post has a Code of Conduct which protects employees from harassment and disrespect and it also speaks to the respect it‚Äôs employees are to show to customers.

Not satisfied with the area manager‚Äôs response, as when we spoke he still was unaware of many of the actual details of the problem until I told him on the phone, even though great detail was provided to customer service in my original complaint call to the organization, I finally decided to contact the Ombudsman.

The area manager told me that the employee had a spotless record, and that when he spoke with the employee about the incident (albeit ill informed since he wasn‚Äôt aware of many of the details until we were on this very call), and the employee denied any recollection of this event, so I wanted to make sure this was dealt with adequately - this employee should not be handling the details counter if he is unable to conduct himself according to the Code of Conduct.

I sent the information to the Ombudsman, and without the Ombudsman calling to speak with me or to clarify any of the information, sent me a letter stating that their investigation was closed and that no further action was going to be taken.

Shocked since they hadn‚Äôt even spoke to me to discuss this matter first, I read the letter again and discovered that the location that the Ombudsman cites as having been investigated, and which the Ombudsman said there was no longer any security footage available to verify my story, was a Shoppers Drug Mart Postal outlet ‚Äî not the location the incident happened at and which had nothing to do with the situation.

The location and security footage information that the Ombudsman cites in their response letter to my Appeal speaks to footage for a Canada Post location in an entirely different building, on a different street and that has its own video surveillance policies and footage per Loblaws that owns Shoppers Drug Mart. The incident I had did not happen in, or anywhere near, the loacation the Ombudman investigated. No wonder the file was closed - except why not contact me first before closing the file?

All around this has been a colossal failure of policies and service, and it is right for me to expect better both in terms of the service that I received and with respect to the follow up and investigation that was done after the fact. This should be reviewed from beginning to end."
"CANADA POST IS THE WORST SHIPPING COMPANY I COULD EVER IMAGINE DEALING WITH, WHATS THE POINT A DELIVERY DATE IF THEY CANT FUFILL IT, USELESS COMPANY."
Horrible service. Ordered a package that was sent to Canada post same day as I ordered. Sat there for a week in bc till I bitched and all a sudden it was sent same day I complained. Then it was suppose to show up Monday ( today) and I even took the day off so I didn‚Äôt miss the package and guess what ? Nothing no package. What a p*ss off. Pretty bad when 90 percent of reviews are bad ones. Pathetic and shame on you guys for turning a once reliable business into this. where you don‚Äôt even know if your item even is gonna show up at all. Very disappointed.
"Friends in New Brunswick posted a christmas card to me in the UK in mid december 2020, it took 2 months to arrive.
They also posted a small parcel to me on 9/3/21, I am still waiting for it.
A beautiful country but your postage service is a global disgrace"
DONT KNOCK ON DOORS. LEAVE THE BOX ON THE FLOOR NO SIGNATURE. DELIVERY TAKE YEARS TO SHOW UP AND IT IS OVERF*ING PRICED . ALSO SOME DAYS UR BOX WILL JUST SIT SOMEWHERE FOR DAYS . JUST DO YOUR F*ING JOB AND STOP ASKING FOR THE 30$-500$ FOR SOMETHING THAT COST LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO WHILE YOU DONT EVEN DO HALF THE WORK YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO
"I have over the past 3 years ( Yes, even before COVID ) paid for 4 REGISTERED LETTERS and NONE had a confirmation of delivery which is a breach of contract.
The latest one addressed to the Court of Queen's Bench ( Manitoba ). Mailed on March 30, 2021. Tracking indicated it would be delivered April 06, then April 07, then April 08, and now today April 09, .. the notification DELIVERY HAS BEEN DELAYED !"
"Garbage, you pay express delivery and pay 20-30 bucks and it takes longer than just sending regular. You drop it off and pay express and they don't ship it for 2 days"
"I watched a video online of a man refused service because they would not honor his mask medical exemption. The man just wanted to buy a stamp and mail letter, was very calm and educated about the law. I will never shop there again and suggest you find the video and see for yourself. Pure tyranny."
This is the worst service you can get. You have to pay extra for fast delivery. Yet your delivery item will take more than regular time. Never use this service. I wish I could give ZERO to the service.
Literally refuses to deliver parcels. Claims delivery drivers have the right to decide if they want to deliver. Seriously? They have the right to decide if they want to do the job they are being paid for? And they still get paid if they decide not to? WHAT THE ACTUAL F***?!?!?
"I have had problems with canada post and now im just so pissed off

So my first package had no unit called the same day to fix it
Since it came from the us and took a month fixed it that day and next day THEY SENT IT BACK ANYWAYS

then today april 7 i look at my tracking for another package to find my out they sent it back to the sender AGAIN and this time my address was correct

And all they could say is sorry maybe next time do this or do that
But NO THEY WONT DO ANYTHING AT ALL

What happen to them giving u the note so ur able to pick up NOPE u have no choose but to pay shipping all over again"
"Canada Post is the worst shipping company. The employees are terrible not trainned and beacsue is all government jobs they dont care about their work. There is no guaranteed deliveries even though they say that. All parcels get late and it is horrible for small businesses.

I do not recommend doing business with canada post."
"Was waiting for a box that was shipped to me from Edmonton ( I‚Äôm from Winnipeg) pretty big box that could fit a drum set inside. Got to my house one day and the big box was on my front porch on the stairs where everyone can see and take it. I‚Äôm suprised no one did as it said in big words on box ( Yamaha ) ... morale of my story is why leave a big box like that on my front steps where anyone can take it.
Canada post is horrible"
"Xpresspost my ass. Paid 4$ for this service because I chose the wrong delivery company. Purolator delivers from smiths Falls Ontario to Gatineau in 24h and it even goes to Montr√©al and back here. I ordered on april 1st and delivers is not until avril 7th.

There is a reason I chose express shipping and that is to get my package on time. It doesn't matter that it was easter. Purolator still delivers. I will never take their service again. It's √† big Loaf of crap."
"I wish I could give them 0 stars.
Absolutely terrible.
Lazy ass workers hiding behind their union. Any other employee would fire them all.
Work 4 hrs at most get paid 8.
Deliver mail if they feel like it.
Leave parcels sitting for days.
Do the Canadian public q favor and close it down.
Let another courier take over.
Will get better service for 1/2 the cost .
Im sick of those self entitled fcks."
"Canada post it‚Äôs one of the worst post service and three countries. It takes 2 to 4 weeks for delivery from one end to the other in North country,. They have lost three packages and I cannot get any response to where they went too.
What kind of a post is extremely good at not responding back to you and losing packages.
It is funny that the US and other countries can still deliver mail within three business days. Hey federal government, why are you so neglecting To our postal performance and the worst there is. This government is terrible. Let‚Äôs vote someone in that will fix the post office. Your soul third grade services"
"Canada post employs the most laziest workers possible. even after they change the door to door service to community mailboxes the employees still find it difficult to do their job. I find that they take the parcels to the nearest center but dont put the slip in the box untill the next day or later. if the package weighs more then an letter the poor worker sends it to the local center to be picked up. I have see them come to my door, insert a slip, and drive away without even knocking or ringing. all because they dont want to carry a parcel. and due to slips being delivered late i have made multiple trips to pick up that were already picked up. what a joke. biggest government scam then COVID lockdowns. no wonder more delivery services are opening up. Cant wait untill they are used more to bury the garbage service Canada post offers"
My documents were dropped off at the post office in Quebec on Mach 12th and picked up for delivery at 17.02 on the same day. The documents arrived in Ottawa six days later at 12.32. I paid for express post next day delivery. What a joke. First and last time I will ever use them. Check it out tracking mw 433 108 139ca.
"I f i could gve a ZERO i would- paid $90 for express delivery to UK for a small package. got stopped along the way. been trying to find out what is the hold up. no one can tell me . their customer service center is useless- they cant ick u the phone and call someone to check this out? 3 weeks later - no sign of anything. they have the nerve to transfer me to the purolator office to figure it out myself? oh forgot to mention when i raised a service ticket , their system message said they would get back to me 3 months after i sent my package - 3 months!! (remember that i had sent the package rush for a 2 day delivery!!!??) . so when i called to check this out , they told me 2 weeks you would get some info. well its been 3 weeks and i am yet to receive anything. Typical governmental organization- no ownership of anything and its always someone else's fault"
"So I was missing a package for a litte over a week now so i called canada post to ask what was going on because the tracking number said wrong address which i found weird, they said the same thing and i thought maybe i jsut put the wrong address, they informed me they sent it back.

So i checked the receipt and with the sender and nope i pout the right address like every damn time i order form these guys so canada post basically lied to me, did not even try to contact me in any way shape or form and sent the thing back..... you guys go on strike every year holding our mail hostage and you cant even due your due dilligence and try to contact me?> if you woulda got a hold of the sender you woulda got the right address and phone number but you cant even be bothered to do that and then you have the gull to go on strike for better pay every year? I hope you guys go under

Worst postal service imaginable"
"Two weeks after the guaranteed delivery date, Nada. No way to accurately track packages as Canada Post is not in the business of providing up to date tracking information. This is why you will continue losing business to Amazon and the likes. Step up your bloody game."
Somehow my package was sent with the wrong delivery driver and went the wrong way by an entire city. Expected delivery dates keep extending and there is a reason my company doesn't use them as our primary carrier at work. I work in shipping.
"Are mail was switched to a new location.We had the same postal box for 43 years and they changed it to go with are civic address.We got new mail keys before they changed
it,The keys didnt work on the new box .We called and complained ,Have had no mail since march 5.They have no clue what they are doing.We the taxpayer pay there wages.I would never use Canada post has long has i live nor ever buy a stamp again.Terrible service.And i am not the only 1 that has had terrible service sending parcels"
"SLOW AND UNRELIABLE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT HAS NOTHING BUT EXCUSES AND ZERO KNOWLEDGE.THEY LOSE PACKAGES AND YOU END UP WAITING FOREVER IF IT EVEN SHOWS UP.
I COULD PUT A 3 YR OLD ON A BIG WHEEL AND SEND HIM OFF WITH A PACKAGE AND GET IT TO ITS DESTINATION QUICKER AND MORE RELIABLE!!!!"
You guys need to do better my package is 43 minutes away it said it was arriving today and you guys had 8 hours to deliver it but u guys failed to. Literally making wait 2 extra business day
On my order I specifically added the pin code to access the building but he didint even tried...The person didint put any notice on the door; basically he did not get off his truck to even try to deliver my package.. no email was sent to me either. I discovered on my own that it was deposit to random pick up location the day after. That why independant compagnies are gaining popularity. People dont want to deal with this kind of service anymore. Anyways good luck.
Garbage. Would rather use ups or fedex. Canada post is slow as all get out
I live in Oshawa and I have ordered items on line to be delivered to my home. I‚Äôm missing at least 10 packages not delivered to my home address and showing delivered. This is insane and frustrating and disappointed back and forth with customer service and the seller. The bottom line is that Canada Post is responsible. The postman is stealing my packages. Who else to blame?
"So they allow you to set a delivery preference online for your tracking info- but they don't follow it. (Front door, Post Office, Lobby, Garage, etc. We'll just leave it wherever the hell we want, because we're Canada Post!)
They ""safe drop"" in apartment lobbies and shrug saying ""miscommunication."" when all that's needed is a little common sense. You'd like to have your expensive item left out in the open to be stolen? I think not. Leave a notice card, you nitwits, if you're too lazy to waddle an extra 8 feet and knock. Use your heads once in a while. Apparently intelligence is NOT prerequisites for employment with CP.
They tell you to sign up for email notifications, but the delivery agent can't be bothered to hit ""send"" in a timely manner, so that's irrelevant. Thanks for eventually emailing my item was ""Delivered""HOURS AGO- but ya took so damn long it was stolen before I got the email. LOL Baboons.
A terrible service, I hope all online retailers abandon Canada Post and ship with anyone else, and eventually they'll shrivel up and disappear. Mail delivery is all but obsolete, and they continuously prove they can't handle the high pressure world of online retail shipping.
To summarize: CANADA POST- YOU SUCK. Always have, always will. You overvalue your worth. If you worked as hard at doing your jobs properly as you do at striking, hissy fitting and whining about how hard your lives are, you'd be heading in the right direction."
"They make the rules when they lose your documents or when there was a possible theft. My employee forwarded some very important docs, checks, CRA correspondence, etc. A month later they admitted there was a problem but wouldn't tell me details because I was not the sender. They admitted to my employee that they found the empty xpresspost envelope and were holding it in a ""secure location"" in Scarborough. They called me to tell me that I was getting a 33 dollar check for my trouble (even though this disturbance has cost me much more). A few days later they sent me an email saying I can't get any compensation because I was not the sender. Icing on the cake."
"Worst delivery, tracking and customer service in the nation."
"Terrible service, terrible delivery times, obsolete in today‚Äôs society."
"I have a horribly history with Canada post. They didn't deliver my pay check because they couldn't get my gate open. A CHECK that was ironically for clearing snow for Canada post mail boxes sites. A lawyer sent my mom a letter regarding the estate of my late grandfather and they put it in the neighbors box and the next door neighbor delivered to our house, but you could clearly see it had been opened. All of my house hold mail was delivered to another neighbors box one day and he returned a whole stack of it, including personal letters and bills. For my latest package it said it was suppose to be here last Friday. It arrived early in the morning, was scanned in around 7 am and then it said at 4:57 pm in the afternoon Friday that my package had departed my city and was to be delivered on Tuesday. I don't know how that make any sense at all. This is only a couple of my delivery experiences with Canada post, there's plenty more. They're lucky they are run federally or they'd be done."
"Canada Post charges enough for services, BUT when extra money is paid for TRACKING service and they DO NOT track the item - it takes a few seconds to scan the item - when customer service is called - first thing that is stated is COVID-19 is causing delays - everyone is suffering from the virus, but some companies such as this are taking it above and beyond ridiculous - this is a total ripoff. If there was anything lower than one star it would apply - TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE"
the worst customer service and shipping company in the world hands down. in 2 months they've lost more product i've shipped then the total amount of shipping fees i've paid. how can they still be in business
"im disgusted. the customer service is USELESS, and overrrall a sh it tty company, its been 3 weeks and a half for a package sent from montreal to gatineau a 1 hour and 30 minutes ride by car, have not been the first time, i would‚Äôve done everything to get it delivered by amazon
PLUS, they LIE about refunding your shipping fees"
This is the worst company. I have a mail box and they still refuse to deliver my packages. Spend all this money for shipping and still have to go pick it up. Don‚Äôt go to Canada post in Thorncliffe at 45 overlea Blvd. The service is terrible and very rude!! This company is incompetent and won‚Äôt properly delivery your package. This happens to me every time.
"If they weren‚Äôt a federal corporation there is no way their business would survive. It‚Äôs been a year with Covid and they still haven‚Äôt updated their adjusted hours on multiple websites. How hard is this? They won‚Äôt deliver parcels to my office, say they leave notification cards but don‚Äôt and make everyone else work around their incompetence. Will avoid using them at ALL costs in the future."
"I sent a very expensive collectors item valued at $3000 through Canada post express shipping. By the time the item has reached Toronto from BC it was no longer being scanned or tracked through their system .. aka an employee stole item and discarded the box so there was no way to track it or get info on it. 6 weeks went by on an express shipping item and Canada Post agents gave me nothing but attitude, disrespect as well as conflicted stories on where the parcel is and what had happened to it. After the 6th week and 4-5 phone calls they finally admitted it was lost. Long story short DO NOT SHIP WITH CANADA POST! They take no responsibility for their employees that steal and go through parcels. Absolutely sickening that this goes on in our postal system."
Everyone from Canada post should get laid off. They are brutal I‚Äôm only going to buy items from the internet if the delivery company isn‚Äôt Canada post they are brutal I can‚Äôt even imagine that they get paid!!!!
This about the third time I have had packages for me delivered to a wrong address. The packages are clearly labeled and easy to read. (At least for me.) The first time package was never recovered. The next two times at least a person brought me the package. I'm believing that the delivery persons are not reading the packages and are just blindly following the GPS routing.
SO FRICKING SLOW I MEAN COME ON I HAVE BEEN WAITING JEEZ
"Extremely slow service. They never delivered parcel on time. If I could I would give zero star.
Very disappointed with the service."
They damaged my package totally then I got nothing.
Worst customer service ever. Your wouldn‚Äôt be delivered for weeks just for them to tell you that they are going to return it back to the sender. Just a disgrace. Never will I ever use this service again. I would rather a pigeon to carry my package.
"Extremely slow service. My package has been in Canada for over 3 weeks now, and it has still not been delivered. It‚Äôs beyond ridiculous."
Canada Post is great they my order was at my door in 2 days.
"I sent a package to Ethiopia using canada post and the package was very important to deliver to nurses working
Frontline but canada post failed to deliver.
The package lost but it was insured after so many emails and complaints they paid for the package that was insured.
The damage done by not delivered the package was far worse and three of the nurses get positive for covid 19
What a shame service of canada post
The package face mask and face gurd for nurses working frontline
What a shame service!"
I payed 25$ for a f..g mail gatineau-romania... after 8 days arrived in Montreal! 250Km in 8 days in canada... this is the worst postal service in the world... now I still wainting for a new scan details...
"I'm so sick of their useless tracking system. It says expected dilevery on Friday. Now rechecking it now says Tuesday after already being a week late, with no information update since the day it was sent. So I have no idea where it actually is.

DO BETTER!"
I‚Äôve been waiting for MONTHS and I have not received my package yet...it‚Äôs not ok
"I dont know where to start. This is not a 1 time bad experience. Its an accumulation of many bad experiences over the last decade. This happened a few years ago:
I had a parcel from CHINA and it took 5 months to arrive to canada. I stopped looking at the tracking as it took so darn long. When i did finally came around to check tracking no., it said my parcel was delivered a week ago. But i never received it. I called Canada post to file a report follow up on my case. They sent a mailman to come talk to me. He asked me if i had CCTV from over a week ago to see if he had dropped a package. He wasnt even sure if he dropped it off or not. My cctv only records for 5 days so that record was no longer available. He shrugged and said there's nothing else he can do. Darn it, is this how a case is closed?
(The parcel is address to my office, opened weekdays 9-5. I'm always there. Not a chance i would have missed it)


I'm pretty sure they may have sent to wrong address as regularly receive wrong mail. As a good samaritan, i have (many times) re-deliver the mail to the correct address myself.
I'm almost certain they sent my parcel to a wrong address.

Irresponsible service.
Ive had so many mishandled parcels with clearly UP arrows on boxes and they ALWAYS deliver NEVER the right side UP. Postal office pick up points are no exception. Directional labels are there for a reason. But it seems like they have no idea what the labels mean. If they do, they are knowingly negligent on their job."
"The worst service, I have ever seen, they lost my parcel multiple times, never going to use their services again."
"item was lost on shipping, only get $115 refund. item value was $640 . very bad exprerience . ."
"Canada post sent my parcel to a non Canada post staffed postal outlet in Victoria then refused to let my parcel go due to an ID issue. My name matched on the parcel but not the address. After showing the staff that I was the one who ordered the item they still refused to let it go. Ridiculous. I have been picking items up before with the same situation for over 5 years and have had no issues at a nearby postal outlet. Suddenly I can't pick up my own parcels. I had to pass the item for someone else to pick up on my behalf. The whole situation makes no sense at all.

What a lovely broken mail system!"
Sent a package to a customer and Canada Post damaged the shipment and refused to pay for it. They even blamed the packaging. Stating I did not package it properly but it was in the manufacturer's glass box. These are sent all over the world without problems but Canada Post breaks it and they blame everyone else
"CNada post lost a loyal customer because of your delivery mistakes. I had delivery of my passport on 4march and when I track my passport said they delivered but I never get my passport, even my building mail boxes are in main road but they didn‚Äôt find it necessary to ask for sign or call notification as it was confidential document.when I call their office they didn‚Äôt take any responsibility, i called continue for three for days but always one reply that you will get call by our supervisor. Till today I didn‚Äôt get any call except one time that they were looking for it. Now they said they put my request on ‚Äú package miss placed‚Äù
They gave me ticket no. 0140334408 but no worth as they simply close this on their behalf without my knowledge.
Worst experience, poor delivery persons, zero responsibility level ..."
Fast service like the locked locker idea it‚Äôs safer than left by door. It came faster then the tracking suggested date. No delays.
Canada Post is SO slow. They send you notifications advising when a package will arrive and it‚Äôs always a week or two later. Sucks.
"Parcel arriving from China in Richmond, BC, was handed over to Canada Post March 5th 2021, after successfully cleared Customs. After 2 Delivery Notices passed in failure, Canada Post changed tactics and March 15th a delivery delay for my package was indicated with an open ended outlook for a successful delivery. Package travelled 2 days from Shanghai to Richmond (9059 km) however cannot leave the Richmond postal facility for Bowser,BC 178 km. as it stands now, day 16 and waiting. An IN depended performance review for this corporation is in order due to the fact that the above incident is the rule and not the exception."
"Horrible. They never get my mail to me and I've been at them for months. Used to never be a problem before but now. Idk what is going on but they need to work on customer service. They will trigger you and approach mental health inappropriately. They called the cops on me for saying ""you people not knowing how to do your jobs and making ppl go through Rollercoasters is suicidal worthy"" and the cops kicked down my door then harassed and assaulted me in my own home and left me injured and suffering with pstd and chronic pains."
"I parcel 2 large bags from Brampton to Saskatchewan on Dec 10, 2020
Bags was 23kgs, now canada post delivered one bag only and they lost second bag and denied me refund of bag & stuff value.

Can i claim against canada post in court?"
"Canada post has partnered with a Shady organization (Peoples Trust also known as Peoples Group) that provide what they call travel prepaid credit cards licensed by Mastercard in the UK. These cards are NOT good for travel nor are they convenient for everyday purchases. They are also not insurances by the Canadian banking system. Abide by Manatoba law only(as per their terms). Claim to allow you to ' cash out at anytime (sec 96 of Terms and conditions)but do not, as I tried.
From my personal experience, I deposited an amount of money into my card with the confidence that Canada Post was backing this organization. But than the nightmare began!! I used the card online a couple of times(totally legal merchant exchanges as per sec.35 of T&C) than they FROZE the card.
I had to call 7 times because their phones cut out mid conversation with no call back. Than I requested my funds be returned to me as per their terms and conditions agreement(96), they said they could not release the funds until they investigate and requested alot of unusual I formation. Photo I'd, bank statements, a written e explanation why I got the card and a hard copy of a bill payment to my house. Keep in mind I provided government issues ID when I bought the card. I provided all this information again but I thought it was shady so I looked up the company behind the card service. It turns out peoples trust/Peopls Group is in a class action lawsuit for l losing or possibly selling the private personal information of ts clients. Peoples Trust was also sued for extracting unauthorized and illegal fees from prepaid cards( Bernstien v. Peoples Trust Company')
How Canada post allows their continued partnership I dont know!!!
I have called to check on this situation at least 3 times in the past week and all I get is we will call you back and it never happens.
So two days before a business trip and I have close to $2,000 in limbo for over a week for no apparent reason!! Can someone at Canada Post tell me why??
The other thing is that when you go to Complain Canada post directs you to the Shady companies (Peoples Trust) complaint department.
I'm computer savvy but can you imagine some of our seniors that want a save way to travel without having to carry pills of cash or deal with banks in a foreign country?
I'd like to know how often this happens to others and what is Canada Post have to say."
"Very, very, very bad service !!!
Everything going fast in other countries and all of a sudden became very slow and long coming in when Canada post delivers...stop telling us that you have a lot to do due to the pandemic and do your job..."
"My package sent from Victoria Jan.5 2021, it's delivered to Richmond at Jan.6 and stay there to Jan.21. Wow, i'm still ok.
Feb.22 2021 my package arrived destination country :)
But today (March.18), i still wait my package and they said ""we're doing a customs"". 1 month for customs???? Are you kidding me?"
"I get a call today for a delivery to pick up downstairs. I asked them to bring the package upstairs, using the elevator. They say they're not allowed to due to covid. I said I was disabled and canada post insisted I come down. When I get downstairs, they're calling up to my apartment for whatever reason, I heard the telecom. Then when they see me walking with a cane, they(2men) start pointing and laughing, jump into they're truck, wave and drive away. If I could press charges I would. The whole experience in on security cams. Thank you canada post for the amazing customer service."
"Can‚Äôt be trusted with mail, I‚Äôm less likely to order from any company that does shipping with Canada Post. The delays are unreal, domestic letter mail should not be taking 10 days. The experience with Canada post prior to the pandemic was just as bad. Mail being delayed to the point where bills are late and deadlines are missed. In order for Canada post to improve quality of service for Canadians, a restructure of the company is needed. The pandemic should not be used as an excuse to delay an essential service. Other industries have adapted to the consumers needs. Since we are a year into the pandemic: we have curbside pick up, no contact delivery, QR codes. However, Canada post has done nothing to adapt to accommodate the safety of employees with effective operations of services. I really hope Canada post joins the rest of us in 2021."
If I could rate in the negatives - I would. Your precision targeter is the most archaic piece of nonsense I have ever worked with. Every page loads in French. I can't simply duplicate a previous mail campaign. This whole thing is a huge waste of time. It is shocking that your online service is this terrible.
"Like the other poster wrote, parcels seem to be having a giant party in Richmond. How the online tracking update goes from ...being delivered, to processing in Richmond, to shipment is now delayed is beyond me. Who writes the tracking info updates? A confused drunken sailor? Every delivery is a joke. Forget getting anywhere on chat. I get the distinct feeling that while they tell you to hold on while they check into the matter, their poker game continues in the staff room until sufficient time has elapsed to get back to the chat to write the usual bull tweety which is "" we are experiencing higher than usual volumes, hang tight""."
Parcel spent 5 days in Richmond and is still there! ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed ...being processed
"Signed up for a ""business"" account. Apparently I'm supposed to save up to 40%. Savings are literally 0%.

Online portal takes my order, then won't let me re-print a Waybill!!! Won't let me cancel the damn order...

Have to call their 1990's Phone support. 6 menu options, followed by 3 menu options.

Followed by incompetent, LAZY and rude workers (Government....) followed by getting hung up on.

Are you kidding me? Literally the WORST customer experience and user experience I've had since getting out right scammed."
"When I moved, I thought I did the right thing by using Canada Mail Forwarding. God, was I wrong! Although I only moved 15 km from my last mailing address, Mail Forwarding takes over 2 MONTHS to get redirected to me! While CP will use the age old excuse of the pandemic, this doesn't wash anymore! I WILL NEVER USE CP MAIL FORWARDING AGAIN! A notice sent to me over 2 months late cost me $125 in late penalties!"
"I hate Canada post!! They‚Äôve given me nothing but a hard time. I ordered a package a month ago and it took it 2 weeks to go from Mississauga to the beaches then the delivery drivers have no clue what APT means and can‚Äôt deliver my package and sends it back. SCREW YOU I‚Äôve been waiting for over a month and now I don‚Äôt even get my package. And Canada post can‚Äôt do anything about it. Screw your service, you guys need to get your s**t together quick or let people know that you‚Äôre f***ing up everyones ordered and you‚Äôre okay with it. I wish I never had to go through you guys. Horrible. Het your business together. You make enough damn money."
"I usually don't like leaving negative reviews, but I'll make an exception for Canada Post. Today is March 15, 2021, and while we're still in the midst of the COVID pandemic (it's just been going on for over a year), I'd expect Canada Post would have adjusted by now... but guess what? They have not! Is it surprising? Not really. Just a few key facts to illustrate what I'm talking about:
- A couple of days ago, my parents in Europe sent me a package via DHL. I literally received it two days later. If it wasn't for me taking my time to pay the Custom duties, maybe I would have received it within a day.
- Last week, a small package was sent via Canada Post Expedited parcel for $10, from Toronto to where I live (45 km away). Shipping delay: 1 full week. Yes, you read well. The EXPEDITED service takes a full week for a delivery within the same metropolitan area.
Granted the DHL service is more expensive, but it sill doesn't explain the difference in service. Shame on Canada Post. No wonder why most people can't stand them. I just wished the whole organization be taken over and deeply reformed."
"I'm writing this review as recently I'm receiving mail from the US that is taking 2 to 3 months to reach me from as little as 200 km away ( Grand Forks ND) .. I receive trackable mail that's not been scanned.. unable to trace.. etc.
Last year I ordered from the Philatelic Sales section .. an order of $215.00.. they completely lost it.. it was tracked from Ottawa.. to Montreal to Halifax.. to Vancouver.. to Edmonton.. to Toronto.. it never was found.. thankfully there was 1 helpful lady in their customer service area of the Philatelic Sales.. Bernadette.. we worked together and my order was finally replaced 4 months later..
I use eBay a lot and I'm waiting for orders from 3 months ago..
I'm older and can remember when it was 5c to mail a letter.. now it's 92c and takes 5 times as long for mail to arrive.. they should go back to mail trains.. you got your mail in a timely manor..
The only worse postal service I've used is Mexico.."
Why would canada post sit on my parcel for 7 days after it was clear from customs and send it back to customs was told custom sent it to the wrong address shipping label that was put on was correct and virtual assisant is a waste of time
"Bad service. Never deliver on time.

But I just thought it‚Äôs maybe only in BC. My package left Ontario and arrived at Richmond(BC) on the next day. Looks like Post officers in Ontario is working properly. I guess those workers in BC is the one with no motivation but always thinking about how to cheat on everything."
"Lost completely trust in Canada Post, as a matter of fact I do not use it no longer even if been more expensive just to send a simple letter I pay any other private company. The system is very poor in real action, I got so much mail delivered in the wrong place without accountability even after complaints and complaints, it's like third world countries. I had given them so many chances forgiven that I can write a book about it. The final nail on the coffin happen when I did move, bought a plan to deliver my mail to the new address, lots of mail like bills and simple letters were never delivered I got phone calls from collecting agencies saying that I didn't pay eletric bills witch l never recieved, called Canada Post they said they would investigate and get back to me, called 3 times with 3 promises of investigation witch never happens. It's a shame just to have Canada's name on it, It should change their name to maybe not sure post."
"Truly awful company. I doubt they have ever tried to ship using their own website. Is it too hard to have a button that says 'ship' on the top of the home page that opens the shipping form? Canada post employees must be looking forward to going out of business, they need to be accountable to the Canadian public and stop going out of their way to be the worst shipping company. The only times I use them is when I am FORCED because the recipient uses a PO BOX. GET RID OF CANADA POST and let other courier companies deliver to the PO Boxes."
Canada post is horrible I paid for expedited delivery package was supposed to be here on March 11 didn't show up so checked the tracking and now it says it's gonna be another 5 days that is not expedited and it is not what I paid for use any other delivery service but Canada Post they just rip you off
"Twice in leas than 3 weeks now the CP carrier for my neighbourhood/street (Erin Ridge Road Calgary Alberta) has messed up delivery with my packages.
Last week he scanned the package as delivered yet didn't deliver it. A few hours later it was scanned as card left in box and item at post office for pick up. I go to the post office and no item there. The driver held it on his truck and it did not show up at the post office until after 6pm the next night. I was literally standing in line at the post office to collect it when he arrived with a cart full of packages and it was in that cart because the lady working at the post office had to dig through that very cart to find it and she told me so herself that he shouldn't have held it this late. According to the cards packages are supposed to be available after 1:30pm the following day. Why did he hold items on his vehicle until after 6pm the following evening???
This week he delivered a package of mine to the wrong address and now I'm out a $100 custom made windbreaker from Germany. Canada Post is absolute trash!"
"I have been waiting for my tracked parcel 6 weeks now, it's been in transit over the atlantic for a whole month, which i could handle if you could speak to someone and get some re-assurances all is ok, but no, you just get bots, this company is the worst i have had to endure, they make Hermes look good."
"Worst service ever! My package with important documents was lost and never got to the final destination. Do not use this company! Use FedEx, Purulator or any other. Canada Post is the worst mail delivery system I have ever seen. Customer Service terrible as well!"
"Awful arrogant lady at customer service hotline i just spoke today Tuesday march 9,2021 around 1:30pm - 2pm my location alberta she told me its not the Canada post responsibility to deliver package in front door they only put it in drop box and i said how can you put the big items in the post box it will not fit they should deliver it in front door and she said they don‚Äôt do that they usually put a note for pick up in drop box down the building and i ask her then why Canada post has an option online to choose if front door delivery or pick up?! Because i have baby with me i said I cannot go downstairs to get the box with the baby how can I carry that im only alone at home nobody left with the baby if i get the box downstairs thats why i set the delivery by front door and this time it‚Äôs covid19 pandemic I can‚Äôt take the baby with me!.and still she said its not the Canada post responsibility to deliver front door that i need to get it in post office and she said she doesn‚Äôt know the delivery date how come she doesn‚Äôt know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
If you want more details canada post for what i know your system recorded the conversation just return to that"
"Please remove ""Canada"" from your name.
Overpaid Union Workers = Garbage Service.
This easily has to be the most mismanaged company in Canada and wouldn't last a day in the private sector.
What an embarrassment to our beautiful country."
"My PS5 was to be delivered over a week ago then a few days ago then a couple of days ago and now ""item delayed stay tuned for updates"" One of the first Google hits when searching Canada post steals.. is Canada Post steals PS5's....they cannot tell me where my item is and trying to get a PS5 is like wining the lottery so now I am out a PS5..."
"Canada post is THE worst delivery in Canada. Anything that comes through Canada post takes an average of a week longer to receive due to their incompetence. Not a single parcel has been successfully delivered from Canada post in 2021 (we received a letter that there was ""too much snow to deliver"" after just a dusting). Every other delivery service will get it there, on time, no matter the external factors. They're just competent enough to figure it out.

Koodos to the little guys outplaying the ""big (lazy) dogs""."
There are many reasons why every time I see Canada Post is gonna deliver my package I want to cry. One of them being it took them a week to ship within the city.
"They are good at finding excuses and eat your parcels! 7 weeks, 6 parcels all in Canada, and not even move, their website can not track them~ Before this, am in BC, Van, but my parcel delivered to ON! They asked the value of the parcel, and nothing further! I can see many letters for 4 streets away show near my house. If your parcel went to the wrong address, as for the house owner 10% or lower chance will be a good person."
"Worst service, horrible, very unprofessional"
"Why do businesses continue to do business with CP is beyond me. It has been the worst postal delivery service for decades. Package delivery take an iternity to arrive, no accountability, outclassed by all their competitors. I patiently waited a week and a half for my package, a new mobile phone, being sent within my CITY, not an international or provincial shipment. Check my tracking number ""Verifying recipient address"" from the day tracking was available..a week ago. Ok, I didn't get a call, neither did my mobile company, so I call, ""Oh, yes sir, your package is with us, can you verify your address"". Now? Now? we're clarifying? Two days later, still no change to tracking info, I call again, oh yeah, I see you spoke to someone, I'm going to place a note, it should ship next week. Utter GARBAGE service and company."
Very disappointed paid express for my nephews birthday gift to be delivered on time was told it was a 3 days service. Item was processed on March 2nd tracking says my package won't be delivered until March 8th. I don't think I should have been charged the express rate because this certainly isn't üòí. Won't be using this medium next time Ship Time's service is way better.
"Recurrent trust worthy review
I order ALL the time from one company that only ships canada post. Their service is so bad, so unorganized, my packages show up in the processing facility in montreal (where I live) and the next couple of days it shows up in ontario. If not, there are ALWAYS missorts, processing errors, the driver cant deliver, put on the wrong truck"
"Brutal.
Dont speak with customer service. Its a waste of time. They cant answer any questions or get any more details on your parcel than the automated service can give you... and that is no info.
The post offices arent scanning items properly.. so U never know when ur getting your things, all my parcels are insanly late... and its sitting 5 min away from me but i can't pick it up... this service is the WORST ive experienced... the absolute worst.
If you can avoid using them for your mail, then ur better off.
When the people cant even call the office your stuff is sitting at.. then that's lower than low.
Canada Post are thieves. Stealing money with false promis of delivering on time or close to ontime.

Lies lies lies.

Terrible terrible service.. not even 1 star guys.. 1 /4 of a star.

Very poor... very very poor services."
"My incoming parcel has been sitting at the sorting center for three days with no movement whatsoever according to Canada Post's tracking information. The delivery standard date came and went and it's still just sitting there. This package was shipped on the 11th of last month, and now it's the 5th and I still don't have it. I ordered another package this week from the other side of the planet, shipping through DHL, and I had that package within three business days. Totally insane."
"As I quickly went in to drop off a package cause the second door was still open I walk into the female staff glaring at me (blonde hair) I say sorry as I look at the time to see if it was her lunch and she still had about five minutes. I walk out the office doors to the box room to hear her say to a worker. They can never stop coming in eh I can never leave it‚Äôs so annoying. I‚Äôm sorry if ur job is an inconvenience to you, why are you working there."
"Worst delivery company in existence. Very incompetent. Every time i order something online, they never buzz up or call. Dont even attempt to get ahold of me. Just gives me a slip in my mailbox, when they could easily just buzz me and i could have grabbed it in 30 sec. What i paid for. Have another delivery coming, wanna bet they do the same thing for the 3rd time in a row? lol Smh. #DefundCanadaPost"
"WOWWW!!! Canada Post need people that speak FLUENT ENGLISH!!! unbelievable was so hard to understand the person on the phone and made it sooooo frustrating, at the end I ""think"" my issued was solved but not too sure, im gonna call back and talk to someone else just to make sure, what a terrible convo that was"
Definitely unprofessional customer service and they don‚Äôt provide you with any solutions. They make the problem seem like it‚Äôs yours when they messed up on their end. If you‚Äôre able to not have your items shipped by them I highly encourage you not to
"We've had our tracking info say ""out for delivery, expect by end of day"" for 3 days now. After it initially being scheduled for delivery a full week ago, our package is still not here or updated."
"Canada post is an embarrassment!! I ordered very expensive item they picked it up on Feb 2nd 2021and was supposed to reach me on Feb 10th 2021..and guess what it is now March 2 and they still have no info on where it is!!! This is canada post for crying out loud..so the sender opened a ticket on it and decided to send me the item by UPS she had it picked up at 5pm on Thursday February 25thfrom Bellville Ontario and it arrived February 26th at 8:45am near Calgary Alberta!!!!! That's incredible!! But yet canada post has no idea what happened to my package (BS) also the item is 15 pounds and 4'x1'x1' not small at all so its not like it got misplaced...there answer from the manager was"" sorry there is nothing I can do"" this is very disgusting business practice..canada post is not reliable and in my opinion not worth using anymore.."
The person who is supposed to deliver packages - does not! They fill out delivery notices without attempting to deliver the package. This happens on a regular basis. I cringe at the prospect of Canada Post (non) delivery.
"If I could give them less than 1 star, I would. Totally incompetent shipping company that doesn't care to resolve missing packages. Don't even bother calling customer service. They are all using COVID as an excuse for their laziness. I will never do business with a Canadian company again due to shipping from Canada."
"Don't get fooled on the delivery times. They advertise priority post envelope would get there the next day but due to covid 2 days. It's been 5 days and still not there. Called the customer service line, spoke to a manager they had no answers, they couldn't do anything either. If its urgent use UPS, don't waste money on canada post and their priority post."
My package says it was delivered 2 months ago! My family has ordered packages with the same contents as mine and they came on time. I have complained 5 times but nothing helps! This was supposed to be a Christmas present. Very frustrated.
"Many many bad experiences. They have high charges but the services provided are rubbish. Packages not shipped in time, they don't take any complains seriously. I would not recommend this to anyone. The plugin i have is giving a lot of hard time. some of my packages where are not even picked up from the mailbox, still not delivered it had been over a month now since I dropped them in the mail. it still shows me it wasn't scanned by Canada post. I complained once still no progress."
"Outdated company still operating as if its the 90s. Couriers are not able to call/text when delivering packages. They come at random times throughout the day and give zero heads up as to which day they will be coming. No emails are ever sent to give updates about the package. I literally had a courier attempt to deliver a package to me when I wasn't home, and found out about it 2 weeks later because the doorslip went missing and I received no other notifications about it.

This kind of stuff has happened more than 5 times with this company throughout this year alone. And when I complain to customer service, they don't try to do anything to fix the problem, they just keep saying that's just how their company works. Lol"
"There slow, useless and üêï üí© at there jobs"
"A national embarrassment that this utterly incompetent outfit is representing us. Couldnt deliver a package on time if our national security depended on it.

If you have the misfortune of having to deal with these clowns, dont expect anything to be delivered but excuses. Whatever in hell is going on behind the scenes here, needs to be thoroughly audited and overhauled.

3 delays later and no indication of when I'm getting my package. Absolute joke of postal service."
"CanaLost Post - I still have not received items shipped from Canada to UK a month ago. Postage was more expensive than the items and not even tracked!
Ordered the same day, I did receive items shipped from China (further away), tracked and for a 5th of the postage cost - over a week ago.
I would love to buy more stuff from Canada, but if this is a reflection of their postal service, who would want to?
Canada Post? - or should that be CanaLost Post"
"I did a ticket to post canada for my 1000$ package Tracking Number: MW551207983CA
and they asked me to tell it to the seller : Any further action must be initiated by the sender of the item. If you have still not received the item, please notify the sender and instruct them to contact Canada Post if they wish to initiate a claim.
I did it 3 times but the seller dont want help me.
Then I retryed to do a second ticket to post canada and they playing me violon about : Any further action must be initiated by the sender.
To who I asking help NOW ? To the police ?!?!?!?!?!?
Omg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I agree with everything all the other reviewers are saying about Canada post. I have experienced everything that has been discussed by other reviewers. I just want to add an extra layer...our delivery person is also terrible. He is rude and self righteous. Just because they‚Äôre unionized, they seem to feel they can talk to people any way they want to and demand things without the risk of losing their job. I want to file a complaint with Canada post but I‚Äôm afraid of what will happen to my mail if I do. I simply asked what he thinks happened to my letter that I‚Äôve been waiting for 5 weeks that was just mailed from 400km from my city. He basically replied with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs your fault because you didn‚Äôt pay for tracking‚Äù and he proceeded to reprimand me for not putting a slash through letters that were arriving at my address and don‚Äôt live at my address. The way he spoke to me was incredibly demeaning. Now he stops me every time he sees me to complain about everything from tell people not to park on the street to me not the snow on the snow bank. And when I tried to explain that the car wasn‚Äôt mine, he rolled his eyes in indignation and sped off. Absolutely unacceptable attitude from someone who salary comes from out taxes."
Reliable service. Received parcel 2 days before
"Here we are again üò≥, I don‚Äôt know what is going on with Canada post but get it together, we are paying for a service!!!!!!!
I Received someone else‚Äôs package yesterday üôÑ
Today I go to track my package and expected delivery date is moved to March 2nd now ü§Ø We may have to start driving 4-5 hours to pick things up at least we would receive them in a timely matter!!!!"
"I try to avoid canada post if financially possible.
this is sad how it has become a joke. delivering to the wrong addresses and delays on delivery due to mistakes in the routing. Covid did not really make a big difference now it is just an excuse to cover up the bad service with cost of postage going up each year and service going down and slower than ever.
AKA snail mail...

i am very worried as it use to be ok, now it is just like other services. going down hill fast :-("
"Here we go again, Canada Post expected delivery date false flag event, As my last order, Expected delivery today, well today is no parcel day. My last order took forever to get processed. Checked my tracking, it still says tracking number provided and yet shows a delivery date today, Did the Postie wipe out on his bicycle on the way from Oshawa to Montreal ?? A flat maybe ? Sarcasm aside, I ordered another item that came from Japan in 4 days ! How come Fed Ex can get it here quick from a location on the other side of the globe during Covid, Yet a trip I can do in 5 hours by car takes forever, Its Priority post, You guys took Priority out of the Post...
Covid is no excuse, if others can deliver during the pandemic, why cant you ? Im done ordering from sellers that use these clowns."
"A waste of money with no service.
Paid for express to be delivered in 14 days. Today is 3 months and yet no delivery. When called they said 'we don't know'.expected arrival 6 months. Paid extra for faster delivery, all talks no actions just to take your money."
"I posted a parcel to Squamish from Dublin, on December 5th, 2020. It still has not arrived. Two other parcels I sent for Christmas arrived in February. My Christmas cards to Vancouver and Montreal arrived in early February, posted early December. I have sent a parcel to Montreal, which Canada Post told me would arrive yesterday and now I hear it is delayed, with no explanation. I am sick of Canada Post. Half of my relatives live in Canada. If only there were another way! The Irish postal service is excellent, so I know it is not a problem this end."
"Dear Canada Post.

Today February 16, 2021, I am a happy man as I just received a Christmas gift posted on November 11, 2020 from Ireland (No, this is NOT a third world country. They are part of the commonwealth as well as Canada).

The package contains a pair of warm wool socks, but since it took 97 days to arrive, my feet were freezing for the last 3 months. The same package posted on the same day arrived in Australia 2 months ago (Yes Aussies get cold feet too) and 3 weeks ago in the USA (Don‚Äôt praise Donald for this, he‚Äôs GONE.)
I understand the concept of running a business efficiently in order to provide dividends for your sole shareholder (Government of Canada), even if it‚Äôs to the detriment of your customers.

I was wondering how long it takes for a transatlantic cross over and I believe that I found who may have been your mail carrier: A 72-year-old UK man has completed a solo trans-Atlantic rowing trip in 96 days.
I just hope that as every other Canada Post employees, this 72 years old man is unionized and get full benefits. He deserve it!

I believe that Canada Post should be replaced by Amazon and they should get all the federal subsidies that Canada post is receiving now. With Amazon Prime ($9.00 a month), it takes a couple of days for an unlimited amount of packages to arrive to Canada from Europe. (Amazon may be able to afford way bigger oars for their row boats)
At least, Canada Post CEO should sign for one of the training seminars organized by Mr. Bezos (Amazon CEO). If it‚Äôs your intention to stay in business for the foreseeable future this may help you to sort your total inefficiency. I will even not talk about shipping coast which is 2 to 3 times higher in Canada than other countries (It must take a postman with a bachelor degree to open a community mail box).

Hope you get at least a smile from this letter, but sadly Canada Post doesn‚Äôt get any satisfaction from their customers. Something has to change and the only foreseeable solution seems to be a loss of your monopoly and a privatization.

Regards"
"Recent experiences: I mailed inexpensive Xmas gifts to my nieces in GB November 26. I didn't want to pay $75 for trackable shipping so I paid $35 and was told 3 weeks for delivery. It's February and the package still has not been received and likely wont be now. Last November an order coming from China made it into the hands of Canada Post in just 5 DAYS, only to sit with Canada Post for 6 weeks before arriving late for Xmas. I've recently had a package sent from GB with tracking included. It's been in Canada Post's hands now for over a week and they tell me it's not trackable and can't tell me where it is.

Calling Canada Post was a complete waste of time starting with the almost 10 minutes it took to actually get to speak with a person, enduring option after option designed to deter people from getting through to a human, and then having them give me an excuse pointing a finger in every direction away from themselves, actually telling me to contact Royal Mail in GB to try to find out where in Canada (with Canada Post) my package is. Unbelievably horrendous service and customer care. I felt insulted by the stupidity of the rehearsed excuses being given. Covid or not, Canada post is incapable of providing the service paid for by it's customers. The main excuse being they handle billions of packages regularly. If CP can't handle the work load then they need to step up the process by hiring more manpower etc. Canada Post rates are not cheap. If they are handling billions then they are making billions. The disrespect shown to customers is absolutely disgraceful. Shame on you Canada Post.

Perhaps CP could learn a few things from Amazon who seem to have their BILLIONS of packages being delivered on time and even sooner lately. Apparently Covid is no match for Amazon's delivery services."
I was told that express would take 7-10 business days. I understand that Covid will make things slower than normal. But why have express options and say it's 7-10 business days when it's going to take almost a month. Lesson learned here...never use Canada Post for urgent matters as it's a waste of time and money! If it's not so important like your receiver could wait for months then yeah it's ok.
"Sent an envelope through xpresspost, advertised as two day delivery. Tracking service showed it was first sent to the wrong sorting facility, where it sat for two days, then to the proper facility for another two days. Delivered after 6 1/2 days. I can't wait for the day when these overpaid and underworked slugs are all unemployed because their deplorable service has made their organization redundant."
"Terrible customer service. The option was call SAFE DROPPING, but they just threw the box in front of the door so they can finish their responsibility without of notification. The box was stolen after 10 minutes by someone. How can that be called SAFE?"
"Zero stars. My mailing address is a P.O. Box number. When I order something online, the vendor says ground delivery but doesn't specify if it's by mail or courier. The vendor advises that they don't know how it will be shipped until it is ready to be shipped. For ie, a vendor I use frequently usually sends by mail but recently sent by courier and it was returned to sender because a courier cannot deliver to a box number. If I use my physical address thinking it will be a courier delivery and instead it's mailed, the post office will not deliver to my physical address. At times I have put both addresses down and I get a nasty note from Canada Post that they will return my parcel to sender if I do that again. I spend hours each week tracking down parcels delivered to the wrong address. I need my mailing address to be my physical address. Canada Post has refused to change my mailing address. I appealed to the Ombudsman and was essentially told there was nothing they could do. The Canada Post Ombudsman is a total waste of tax payers money because they have no authority. So not only is delivery slow but at times I get no delivery at all. I was watching an item in tracking and it took 3 weeks to travel from Calgary to Okotoks (20 mins drive). Canada Post is the worst."
"Zero stars. Worst company ever! Like how do you lose a snowboard? Some Canada post delivery driver is riding my 2020 gnu mullair 164w.

Not a shipping company!"
"Lost my engagement ring! The item was shipped from Hamilton on Feb 5th and arrived in Stoney creek on Feb 6th. It‚Äôs the 23rd today and it hasn‚Äôt moved since even though I purchased expedited shipping! Nobody can give me any answers as to where my package is! Extremely frustrating, I won‚Äôt be shipping with canada post ever again!! Now to try and get reimbursed since I got insurance on it!!"
Terrible. Paid for delivery of a small item about 2 inches long and was told they can t come into my condo lobby due to covid. They come into my lobby everyday to deliver mail in the boxes. I paid for delivery yet I have to bus three miles one way to pick it up. Go through Canpar or UPs. UPs delivered and item for me from Brampton to St. Catharines and took 24 hours and came right to my door. Down with Canada Post and send e mails. I have never been to a website and seen reviews so bad.
Terrible customer service. Item has been sitting in Richmond BC for days with no updates. Package ordered almost 30 days ago. I could have driven to Toronto and back by now. What a joke Canada Post is. I will be using UPS or Purolater from now on. I will also make sure items I buy are never shipped Canada Post.
"If I could leave zero stars I would!
So upset with Canada Post. Angry and sick to my stomach. I just threw away $1,000.
I made the mistake of sending the new phone my son had ordered, to him via Canada Post. I made the mistake of not insuring it. Did not think I needed to as it was sent Express Post with a tracking number! So that's on me. I made the mistake of sending it via Canada Post and not UPS. So, that's on me. I don't understand how a package with a tracking number can be lost! So, 6 weeks after I sent it Express Post and several phone calls to CPC, I finally get the claims letter that the package is considered ""lost"" and here's your $26 postage back and $100 for your troubles. Unbelievable!!!!! I don't want the $100. I want a company to honor their commitment. This is the 4th time since Christmas that I have had issues with Canada Post. No other business would still be in business with this kind of service history. I keep getting the excuse that it is due to Covid. Well, FedEx, UPS and Amazon all seem to be doing quite well. Only Canada Post could fail to earn a profit during a time when there is an unprecedented level of packages moving around the world! Bezos is a Quadrilionairre and Canada Post cant turn a profit! Unbelievable!!!!! And to whomever now has the phone...I hope you enjoy the new phone because my son in the Canadian military is now without it and 3,000 miles away from home. Enjoy it while you can because it will not be lasting much longer as we are contacting the company we purchased it form to have them deactivate it. Good luck, you Jerk!"
"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! COULDNT EXPECT THIS.
They delivered item to a wrong address, made me wait for 1 month 20 days to investigate....and finally no reimbursement of the stuff in the package but only paying postal services $20.00..

NEVER USE CANADA POST AGAIN"
"Like many other reviewers, Canada Post straight up lied to me. I had 5 packages coming. Two got stuck in limbo with no updates for a week. Not notice cards left. Once I put a service ticket in, I got an automated response, no addressing the issue. I got on their chat and I was told delivery was rescheduled because of cold weather. I understand that, but then the weather changed to be about 0 and I still heard nothing. I finally called and they put in a new ticket to start an investigation. For my third package a ""delivery attempt was made""--it wasn't, no notice card left. Someone called me about the investigation of my two packages and told me I have ALL FIVE of my packages with them and that they weren't delivered because my building door was locked (so the weather thing was a lie? Because only two packages were expected during the cold week). My building wasn't locked. I checked twice after I got off the phone and Amazon drivers have been able to access my building many times before this. I couldn't believe they were trying to make me think they knew my building better than me. Canada Post put it on ME and asked me to contact my building manager. To what? Tell them to unlock the door that's already unlocked? They said they left a notice before. I said there was a general notice left on our door with no name or unit number addressed and asked how I was supposed to know it was for me and the customer service woman told me it was for the whole building...what the hell? Awful. I learned from a different delivery service, Canpar (they're awful too) that delivery drivers don't even check apartment buzzers, they just write the card and leave because they ""don't have time"" EVEN if you provide the unit number for them to buzz. Not sure if it's the same for Canada Post, but I wouldn't be surprised."
"I am so sick and tired of how lazy Canada Post has become, tThey wont knock on your door to get a signature due to covid so they leave a ""we missed you sticker "" so now I have to drive to the mall to post office at shoppers that has customers and be exposed stand in line have 10 people pass rather then just ringing my door bell and getting signature safely.."
I haven't had one issue throughout the entire pandemic and I order packages multiple times a week! Thank you Canada post!!
"HORRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE.

Can they just close down already. Always missing items and hardly delivers. Even when you call and they open ticket they never follow through. Just a very horrible horrible experience üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°."
Constant late or missing deliveries from orders off amazon. Why are they still in business? With service and reviews like this they should be shut down or restructured. It's a challenge to even get ahold of them on the phone to find missing packages.
"Since pandemic, there were multiple times they lied about deliver attempts. My WFH office is right next to the door. They also lied about leaving the notice, in fact they never showed up. (I have doorbell camera and will notify me if anyone is there) If I wasn‚Äôt tracking my parcels online I would never know the status and where to pickup. How can a company be so bad... I can understand it might be difficult for them during the pandemic time but at least let‚Äôs be honest and not finding excuses for laziness."
"I'm so over Canada Post. It should not take two weeks for a regular letter to go from Calgary to Vancouver. The excuses are ridiculous - I work in e-commerce, I understand the struggled of shipping and Covid better than most and what Canada post does it just completely unacceptable. I will pay more to use different carriers, but for regular mail what else am I supposed to do. A stamp vs FEDEX is quite a jump.

I mailed three packages recently, all through Canada Post. All from Calgary - one to Florida, one to Vancouver, one to Calgary. The one to Calgary arrived two weeks AFTER the one in Florida was received. How can you even justify that?"
"I will never use Canada post ever again. They stole $1350 from me. I sent out 50 bottles of disenfectant to a customer and when he received it 24 bottles were missing. I charged my customer $50 plus tax for each bottle and Canada post lost or stole half of it and are doing nothing to fix their mistake. The management is extremely rude to me, when they have robbed me and won‚Äôt even cover half or all of the cost when it was their drivers responsibility. Biggest scham ever I‚Äôll stick with ups or purolator. Canada post is nothing but a bunch of thieves"
"Mediocre company. Will not go an extra mile for a customer.
We are unfortunately stuck with it."
"They lied when they said delivery attempt. They did not attempt delivery and left no notices twice.

I called several post offices to find out where package was held. No luck. See tracking that it is being sent back.

I'm out hundreds of dollars. They are not accountable and just awful.

I spent hours reviewing security footage and calling and they don't care.

They screwed me big time."
"Worthless service, didn‚Äôt even call or knock and returned my item back to the post and now when I visited the post office they said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs weird we don‚Äôt have your package‚Äù. I would like to suggest Amazon to not use Canada post for their deliveries."
"They will not deliver any package that will not pick it your 4"" x 4"" square. straight to the post office. Broken packages, wrong address. If it ships with canada post there is gonna be a problem. Everytime."
"I would honestly love to give them no stars my package is 5 days late witch I would be more then understanding if it didn‚Äôt already ship from there warehouse to the city I live in and then the following day return back to there warehouse location, and now I don‚Äôt have any tracking on the package anymore"
"Send a sentimental package to my girlfriend with items worth 50$. 20$ delivery for delivery within the SAME province. 1 day later, they lost the package. Delivered it to a completely different place. Customer service says they will ''look'' into it with a copy pasted text. Worst support. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"Review #2/update: And not even a month later, the service gets worse. Was tracking my xpresspost package that already took longer than the 1-2 days...day 4 today... and it said delivered. I immediately went to mail post box 6 houses down. Nothing there. So now they like to lie. And you can call but you'll just be even angrier when you get off. The survey at the end is useless...sure isn't there for them to learn how to improve. No resolution and they didn't offer any way to help.

Review #1. Unfortunately the pandemic even a year into is still the favorite excuse for poor customer service everywhere it seems. I simply suggest don't charge people for a service you KNOW you can't guarantee. 2 day delivery paid 5x what the weight of the package actually would cost via snail mail. It's been 7 days and THEY made a label error. Now it will be 8 days. From 1 province over. Regular order never took more than 3 days including the weekend. They say they will refund only if the sender submits a claim but what if the reciever paid the shipping!? Why can't we request a refund for shoddy service? The sender won't care it wasn't their money!"
"I live in Vaughan, Ontario. Today is Feb 17. An item arrived Vaughan Feb 12. But they still couldn't deliver it. And this is what happened on and after Feb 12:
Feb. 12
- 6:45 am, Item processed, Vaughan, ON
- 10 am, Item out for delivery, Vaughan, ON
- 10:47 am, Item re-routed due to processing error; Possible delay, Vaughan, ON
Feb. 15
- 4:21 am, Item processed, Vaughan, ON
- 9:23 am, Item out for delivery, Vaughan, ON
- 11:02 am, Item re-routed due to processing error; Possible delay, Vaughan, ON
Feb. 24
- 8:57 am, Item has been returned and is enroute to the Sender, Vaughan, ON

So I have a live chat with their agent. Not surprisingly at all, they don't know why the item is sent back to the sender. Here is the chat transcript:

Agent
4:07 PM
Hello. I am sorry that your item has been returned to the sender. There is no error with your address but there may have been an issue with the label itself.

You
4:08 PM
What does that mean? Are you able to find the exact reason


Agent
4:09 PM
I apologize that a reason was not provided but there may have been an issue with the label.

You
4:10 PM
So Canada post can't deliver an item and don't know the exact reason?


Agent
4:11 PM
I am sorry, the sender may be able to inform you of the reasons when they receive the package back.

You
4:11 PM
I'm just trying to figure out whose fault is this. ""Maybe"" is not a good answer. How can I convince the sender to send again for free if I can't let them know it's their falt

You
4:11 PM
So the sender will be able to know the reason?

You
4:11 PM
Once they got receive the package?


Agent
4:12 PM
I apologize that the depot has not provided a reason. You will need to contact the sender to make arrangements to reship the item back to you. The sender can contact us to submit a claim for the postage fee.

You
4:14 PM
ok ok"
Would give 0 if I could. Ordered a vacuum from Best Buy and Canada post Picked it up on Jan. 20. It sat in Mississauga from Jan. 21 until Feb 7 (17days) until it was processed. Took from Feb. 7 to Feb 13 before it was Processed at Richmond B.C. (6 days).Then from there to Prince George (2 days). E mailed Canada Post twice and got a reply basically telling me nothing the last email I received told me they would not reply to myself anymore and to get Best Buy to look into it. NO apology or excuses they just file complaints into the garbage can. If I could I would never send any thing thru them but they have a Monoply on the mail system
No improvement in service. I have sent the parcel on 10th February. I opted for xpresspost and paid additional amount to get the parcel early. Until 17th February Canada Post did not scan the parcel. The ETA for my parcel was 17th February initially. Now it is saying 19th February. Every time I chat with their customer service associate they don‚Äôt have any answers. They themselves do not follow up. Some of the associate are rude as well. Never going to use Canada post service after this as this is the second time I‚Äôm experiencing bad customer service.
"Just the worst delivery service ever, got a service ticket to resolve my two week plus delivery from Banff to Vancouver. What a total waste of time that was, they still can‚Äôt tell me anything more than what their app. does. My parcel sits in Montreal for 5 days then moves to Richmond BC and sits for 5 days while your app. tells me delivery tomorrow, the next day, then tomorrow, then the next day, what a total joke of a company. Then you try to blame it on COVID-19. Well there are over 3000 one star reviews on here basically complaining about the same issues, long before any COVID-19 came along. Absolutely no way Canada Post would make it in private industry, not a chance!
Kevin King"
"I wish I could give 0 stars. Canada Post is a goddamn joke. Told delivery will come on Monday 12 30 it is out for delivery somehow 3 hours later it can't be delivered and will be done tomorrow. Tomorrow comes no notification that it won't be there but guess what ? It isn't there. I didn't even select Canada post for my delivery as it is what the business that is shipping to me uses. Also failure to even update me on what the ""issue"" was. Wont allow me to select a safe drop when I know it won't fit my mailbox and don't know if I'll be home to accept since they have no standards. How it that the government ran postal service can't provide the same quality service as food delivery or Amazon? What a joke these people shouldn't be working if they aren't going to do their job. Terrible service and terrible customer follow up response. Absolutely never pick them if you have a choice because you may never get your stuff."
"the worst service ever ,they don't deserve even one star,"
"If I could give zero I would! Have been sending post from the UK to Vancouver for 15 years and have had so many lost, late and now returned items. Just received a Christmas card returned which was sent 3 weeks before Christmas to our son. Used the same address I‚Äôve used for years and today, it arrived back in the UK with a Canada Post stating ‚Äúno such address‚Äù which is ridiculous!! Nearly two months after posting and the envelope was slit open too! Surely Canada Post has more intelligence than this... but clearly not. What a rubbish service they are and I‚Äôm furious yet another letter has not been delivered, why?!!! I will do everything I can now to NEVER have to use this incompetent company EVER again!!!!"
"Delivery guy in Yellowknife, dropping my parcels at different addresses, people knocking on my door with my parcels and lm getting other people's parcels. I complained and he gotton worse üò°"
"Instead of my package, I received a yellow slip letting me know that my driveway was too ""hazardous"" to attempt delivery, and that I should consider removing all dangerous conditions before attempting delivery again. While there is some ice on the driveway (as you would expect for all houses in Calgary during a -40 degree streak of weather) there are clear safe paths that we have salted away and we have yet to receive any problems with other delivery services. In fact, in order to get to our mailbox to dispense the slip, the delivery person would have had to cross more ice and snow than in our driveway. I was only made aware that delivery was attempted (and failed) from checking Canada Post's website and seeing on my tracking history that ""a notice card was left indicating when and where to pick up the item"" but there is no such card. The only thing I received was the note that my driveway was too much of a wasteland for their delivery guy to attempt to walk 10 steps up to the door - again, there are salted paths. No date, location, or time given. Essentially, someone didn't want to do their job. Unacceptable service, I don't know why people use this company."
"I have worked in a large, busy shipping & receiving department for nearly 5 years now and have never had the displeasure of dealing with a more inept, unorganized, deceitful and overall useless company than Canada post. They have zero oversight, zero repercussions and zero interest in even trying to properly do their jobs. Tampered, stolen items, kicked and crushed are the way we received many packages (if they arrived on time, rarely, or more likely never arriving at all). They will charge you ridiculous amounts for even the most basic of services and never deliver even the bare minimum, and don‚Äôt even think about trying to get your rightfully owed money back, it‚Äôs long gone. Even a simple card seems like a tough task for them to handle. Couple this with their new ‚Äúcovid policies‚Äù, they‚Äôre absolutely useless and worse than ever. No door deliveries, lies about being delivered and overall near useless services.

But hey, if you want stacks of junk mail and flyers, they‚Äôve got you covered!

I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT USE CANADA POST. I cannot wait until the day they‚Äôre gone, what a glorious day that will be!"
I live in Canada and my boyfriend lives in the usa. We live in a border town. He lives on the usa side and I live on the Canadian side. I send him a Valentine's day card on jan.29th and it is Feb.15th know and he still hasn't got it. He keeps checking his mail for something from me everyday but no show yet. What is taking them so long.
"I ordered from Amazon and really try to watch for it to be delivered by Amazon but unfortunately my item was delivered via Canada post. It is a box too big to fit in my mailbox but the carriers don't even knock on your door anymore! I was home and saw the truck through my window, hoping it was my late delivery to watch them drive away. Why pay the drivers when the post office may as well send a message to say its ready for pickup?
Very disappointed customer as I guess Canada post is pickup only as most things are done online now. Thank goodness for other more reliable delivery services!
Now I have to find transportation to pick up my package that was supposed to be delivered."
"Canada Post lost yet another package
They lose my packages that have tracking and without tracking. I contacted customer service and they proceeded to give me a refund and did, but only for part of it and then said my case was closed! January 31st I mailed a package (without coverage) and they never received it and it's been over 2 weeks! In Canada, we really need a better option than Canada Post! We are stuck with paying exorbitant amounts using UPS or FedEx! I would say that I will never use them again, but seriously - we have no other option!"
Lies about showing up and delivering packages and we have cameras that show no deliveries ever made. Canada Post is a lying bunch of people who don't want to work and no wonder they are losing money. The government should stop funding them and let them really work to keep their jobs.
"I ordered an item from the U.S. in January and I was supposed to receive it by 22nd but up to now I haven‚Äôt ... this is now February 15th! Please shut down Canada post there‚Äôs no need of them they are so useless, lazy, garbage of a companyü§Æ"
"On January 22, I mailed a Registered letter costing $25.89 from Dartmouth, NS to Milton Keynes England. The tracking number says it took until January 29th to get to Montreal and that's where it sits, waiting to be sent to the destination. No updates online or by phone. This is ridiculous."
"The worst... my carrier stops working Wednesday, then doesn‚Äôt show up again till Monday... no wonder they are backed up on deliveries... it‚Äôs not the virus... it‚Äôs the lazy unionized postal carriers."
"Canada Post is the worst! No communication and next to impossible to get a hold of. Even with long lines , the post office at the Bradford shoppers still refuses to put another person behind the counter. But they will put someone out to monitor the line.Absolutely ridiculous! Then after waiting over 20 minutes I'm told that yesterday's parcels haven't been sorted.Luckily they found my parcel otherwise I would have been angrier than I already was.
I also had a parcel that was received by them on Jan 29.I should have gotten by Feb 6 at the latest.It is now Feb 13 and I still haven't gotten it. Every time I check the status I get the same bullsh#t response that there is an error in the tracking. And this isn't the first time this has happened.
For a company that is a national postal service, they do a horrendous job!"
This company should just shut down already they're always inefficient and late and has terrible customer service. If your item is late there is nothing that you'll be able to do about it. My item was supposed to arrive yesterday (from brampton to toronto) and it somehow travelled all the way out to montreal instead.
The delivery man came to drop off the package in front of our front door. He was talking on the phone very loudly while cussing in front of our door. It was disgusting and very rude. It was terrifying more than anything. The company should hire delivery agents who at least know morality and responsibility to work at the company. It‚Äôs disappointing to see someone like him working as a delivery man since I usually had good experiences so far.
"It seems Canada Post relies on Covid to excuse their awful delivery service at every turn. Every delivery service has adapted to it by now. You cannot blatantly say my package will arrive today if it was in Richmond, BC last night, with absolutely no tracking information other than what was available on the day of the order. Seems like CP blames its employees and even its clientele for the issues that *we* experience, as if we were a nuisance to them. Definitely never using Canada Post again, can't believe what a joke this company is."
Canada Post now requires you to fill in a Customs Declaration form and take the thus generated barcode to them so all they have to do is scan that code and take your money. Bad enough they do it that way but only after you spend the time and go through the process do they give you a notice that the system is not functioning. No respect for peoples' time. What a total crap organization. If the people there had to work in the real world they would starve.
"I sent a package from Nanaimo to White Rock. I opted for express post. Cost more, and the package is still undelivered. This is supposed to be a 2 day service. We are now 15 days in. How ridiculous! I should get a refund for my express charge, bit as we all know Canada post is not accountable for anything. No recourse.
Last year they mis directed a package due to reverse numbers on the address. My fault. Though, even with my catching up to and finding the package, they chose to destroy/dump it. (Their choice they told me) rather than go to the teouble of re-delivering it. I would have paid more for the re delivery, but they didn‚Äôt give me the choice. The items were of a personal and sentimental nature, so I was very disappointed. Should have learned my lesson to never use them again. I mean really? The package is there, the customer has communicated with them, and they still choose to just treat it like garbage. How archaic. When they go crying next time about not eliminating Canada Post, I will NOT be in support of retaining this ridiculous excuse for a postsl service. Disgraceful!"
Government have to involve in this matter .what canada post is doing with the customer. Due to canada post service my bussiness is affected . I am very disappointed with service .I can't post anything through canada post .
"PAY MORE FOR A SERVICE!
DO NOT USE CANADA POST.

If Amazon can get my package here in a day or 2...so can Canada Post.
What does Covid (a year old, man made diseases) now have to do with late mail? It's an excuse for their shabby service. Imagine ordering a product on Nov 6 and til yesterday there was no update on the tracking lol. Stop paying for excuses and incompetence. Just refuse Canada Post at all costs. Their employees are mostly thieves and lacking a strong command of the english language."
Here is my ridiculous experience with Canada post. I ordered an item thats 2 hours from my city. Canada post then sent my item to another province. When I confronted them about their error they said due to covid they sometimes send it to another facility. They did not own up to their mistake and lied as to where my item is still! They say its not lost but it has been in the other province for 5 days now. I've ordered from this company several times and it has never went to another province. They make excuses for their error and that it was the right decision. Own up to your mistake and fix it!
I ordered a product from China and took 4 months to deliver. Ridiculous! It was sitting at sorting center since Dec 9. I got it on Feb 11. Bad bad bad!
"This company needs to shut down. Total garbage. I placed an order from shoppers and my item took 3 weeks to arrive. It came from Calgary to Edmonton . I will never use Canada Post for anything. I have ordered packages from China with UPS and Fedex and most time they took was 3days.
Canada post uses excuse that due to covid there is delays, all other couriers seem to have it under control.

This whole company is a scam and need to shut down. Half the time packages go missing and they do absolutely nothing about it."
"Probably the most incompatant delivery service out there, toronto peterborough..my parcel week later stuck in monteal , Nother week for delivery, .. i could have walked the 143 km faster you guys just lost my business. Ill make sure im email n fed ex ready before i use your lazy ass services , never again ..."
"Sent documents Jan 23rd, paid for 3-7 business days with signature. Feb. 11th, the documents have still not arrived. They stress putting safety first...how is this an excuse for poor service? Am I entitled to a refund as they did not fulfill their part of the contract?"
"I paid for a 4 day delivery service on Jan 31, 2021 to the US. Still no delivery. I call customer service. They say 100 people gone home from the Mississauga plant. I will need now to wait til Feb 18? We understand COVID.. If you can deliver, why take our money? This is horrific for a goverment agency to act in this manner. Oh yeah, he said package still in Canada and I cannot get a return/refund. NEVER AGAIN... UPS or FEDEX for sure, next times. This totally sucks. Canada post at least fix your broken website.


Their website tracking says:
Expected delivery: Today
Delivery details
Shipping service: Expedited USA
Tracking number: CX-XXXXXXXXXX
Delivery standard: Feb. 9
Reason for delivery standard date change: Item was received by Canada Post after cut-off time."
"Why are they still operating?! ABSOLUTELY USELESS!
They use Covid as an excuse,all the other delivery companies seem to have it under control except
Canada Post.If you have a choice do not deliver with Canada Post!"
My box containing a laptop arrived today smelling like cigarette smoke to the max! The drivers obviously have no respect for their customer's items. 1 star too many. Their trucks should be considered a work place and they shouldn't be allowed to smoke inside of it. Despicable!!
"Took 1 month to return a package, which was in Canada.. if it were FedEx it would've taken 4 days, terrible shipping service, if you want to wait a month or more you can use Canada post otherwise use FedEx, ups or others. This is not the first time.."
"If I could give 0 rating, I would. Canada Post does truly suck. The worst delivery company in history. I ordered a sim card from Bell Canada which is local delivery here back on Jan. 21. It has been nearly few few weeks and still have not received it. They originally promised by Jan 27, then moved the date to Feb. 4 and still no package. They have now stated on their website no new deliver date. Originally they had an issue with the postal code but they mentioned they corrected the issue and should be at my place within 2 days (that was back in Jan.). I had this same issue with another package back in December which took nearly 2 months to be delivered.

I hate this company, why doesn't the government shut down the company. Why are we paying tax dollars to the executives of Canada post who don't give a rat a** about the general public and making their millions of dollars in salary and bonuses. If a private company had a 1 star review rating, that company would be bankrupt by now."
"This is the WORST postal company in existence. Want your package delayed? Choose Canada Post! Want your package lost? Choose Canada Post! Want to pay extra for ""xpress"" shipping and still have it delayed by 2 weeks? CHOOSE CANADA POST.
I never write reviews but EVERY SINGLE TIME I have to have a product shipped by Canada Post there's ALWAYS a problem.
UPS, FedEx, DHL I've rarely had problems with, but for some reason every single time I use Canada Post my package is ALWAYS extremely late, damaged or doesn't even show up ever.
Oh and to top it all off, as if they couldn't get worse - THEY DON'T WORK ON WEEKENDS.
What an awful company don't know how they even still exist with how terrible they are."
"I ordered an item through Amazon.ca and the product was through a private company called Revive UK. The shipping was free.

I ordered this item on January 12, 2021 and today is February 11, 2021. I still have not received the package. Canada Post had a notification that they were going to deliver it on February 10, 2021 and today they updated the tracking on the web site saying it will be delivered February 12, 2021 between 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM.

I am not holding my breath.

I agree with people on this site. Get rid of Canada Post and their other company Purolator. Both companies are garbage.

I would rather deal with FedEx, UPS, DHL or A&B Courier Service Ltd.

I understand we are in a pandemic and things are slow. I sympathize but these issues have been ongoing way before the pandemic started.

Postal workers and Purolator drivers get paid really amazing money and they get good benefits. At what cost? Terrible service to customers?

Shame on you Canada Post. Your service is terrible compared to USPS and Royal Mail."
"Canada Post is never on time. At this point, they should get rid of their tracking system because there's no point in having one if it is never or even close to being accurate. CP has to be shut down and handed over to a private entity that'll be competent because at the moment all they do is annoy people. Is there a way to bring this up with our local MPs?

One more thing, get rid of those shipping fees you charge because what you're doing now is theft. Charging users fees for a service you clearly cannot deliver."
"Ordered something off Amazon, the tracking said item picked up by Canada post February 8th in Dieppe New Brunswick, and now it says it was processed in Dieppe, i live in Fredericton New Brunswick and it takes them 48 hours to process the item even though it said it was picked up by Canada post. They are the slowest company I have ever seen in my life, and they take ages to update tracking."
"Canada Post is ALWAYS late. I regularly order from an online store which uses Canada Post, and I always get expedited shipping. It is NEVER on time, and they always indicate on their tracking page that a pickup notice has been delivered, which is never the case. I have to keep checking the tracking online, then the pickup notice arrives AFTER I have picked up my package. It's unbelievable how terrible their customer service is. It's incredibly frustrating. I'm waiting for a package that was supposed to be delivered two days ago (expedited shipping), and it still has not arrived. My package, which is being sent to Halifax, NS, sat in Ontario for over 5 days. They picked it up on Feb. 2nd, and it wasn't processed until Feb. 7th. It finally departed from Ontario on Feb. 8th, which is the day it was supposed to arrive. Unbelievable considering sites like Amazon can ship an item in 2-3 days. If I ever have the option to opt out of using Canada Post, I will without hesitation. HORRIBLE SERVICE."
"My package was missing my unit number due to the sender‚Äôs mistake. As soon as I found this out I immediately called Canada post to verify my address. Customer service made it seem like all was well and they were able to verify my address but this morning I checked the status and it being sent back to the sender. Are you kidding me? This package took one month to get here from America and now it‚Äôs going to take another month just to get to the sender and then back to me. This company is garbage. My issue could have easily been resolved without it being sent back and wasting time. It‚Äôs going to be summer before my sweater gets here. This company does not care for their customer‚Äôs service, they are lazy and incompetent. When my package was being delivered through usps it swiftly moved state to state, as soon as it got in the hands of Canada post it spent one week in Quebec. This company constantly uses the excuse of covid. Give it up, it‚Äôs not covid‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs your team. DHL which is an international shipping service got my package to me within a week coming from CHINA. What is canada post‚Äôs excuse? Fedex also has amazing customer service whereas I had to wait on hold for half an hour before customer service picked up. Customer service is unhelpful and gave me hope that I would get my package and that‚Äôs not the case. I have been annoyed by Canada post for a while now but this tops the cake. A while back I ordered something from Montreal to get to Toronto and it took 20 days after continually pushing back the estimated arrival date. Please Canada Post, go out of business so i‚Äôm no longer forced to deal with you. There is 0 customer service skills and 0 business skills. All Canada post does is make people miserable and unsatisfied. Stop using covid as an excuse and own up to the fact that you don‚Äôt know how to run a business and your employees are trash. Thanks to you guys i‚Äôm going to be waiting another 2 months just to get a sweater because of an issue that could have been resolved if it weren‚Äôt for your laziness and lack of customer service & care for your customers. I gave them everything they needed to verify my address and everything was correct. I proved it and in the end it still got sent back. Garbage mail service, I hope they go down."
"I've always had a god aweful experience with Canada post. I ordered a package and for literally a day it stayed in their facility mean while amazon delivers in a day, just saying. That aside my package was supposed to be delivered today and I checked all day at the front door and my entire family is home and two dogs also it's covid so chances are one person would be home. But what do they do, they don't put the package at the front door and didn't even put it in my local mailbox they put a note saying you weren't at home so please go to this Canada post to pick it up. Mind you no one came to my front door and the fact they put the note in there proves it cause they're suppose to put it on your door. What sense does it make to put that note in the mailbox when no one goes out at unless it's important and we have a stay at home order again due to covid. That package would have been sent back if I didn't go look. There have been countless other times they've screwed up that I could write a book. I honestly want them to go out of business because they don't improve against their competitors only get worse and our local post mail is extremely rude and hard to deal with. He literally once refused a payment method because he would have to go back to his van."
"Literally has to be the worst delivery service in the world. For some reason, every package they get has to be sent and processed in Montreal even if the package was originally sent to a place an hour away. their way of doing things doesn't make any sense my package was more than a week late and when they came they didn't even buzz the door just left me a notice. I am fed up with this lazy company they don't care about anyone's packages or mail, hence why we see a large spike in missing packages and mail. honestly just go bankrupt or something so some reliable company can take your place. safe to say I will never be using Canada post again and neither should you"
"Xpress post: 4 business days if it's ANYWHERE outside of Toronto/GTA.
What a joke. Garbage speed, idgaf about a pandemic, don't offer Xpress if you're only able to be hastily in the GTA."
"Gave me the wrong community P.O Box key for the hundredth time. Kick rocks Canada Post, this isn't the first time and this will not be the last time. Happens too frequently, time to move on from you guys for personal shipments."
"Called 10 times during 4 days to redirect my package one say ok the other no problem another told me that my package was lost... now it‚Äôs in Toronto and i am living in Ottawa.
Those f*ucker doesn‚Äôt care"
"Worst company I have ever dealt with. Constantly rude customer service reps and drivers. Packages always delayed or ""lost"" for no reason. Every other company has no problem delivering my packages on time, not Canada Post. Please close your doors so a real company can do this job right.
Only review I have ever written this company is just so bad I cannot emphasize it enough."
"This is by far the worst mail service in Canada ... very disappointed it talked weeks to get any peice of mail and when it come you don‚Äôt know if it will be in your mail box or someone else‚Äôs as it happened so many times . My parcel I‚Äôve ordered is all over the place took about a month to get there and the do zero about it, I get there‚Äôs a delay but put it on there amid just let me assume... I‚Äôve a parcel sent to st.johns newfoundland and the sent it back to the original place and now they got to send it back to Newfoundland which make zero since. Makes me so argue that this is the only mail service as it‚Äôs the shittys one. They don‚Äôt have very good agent to talk to there all compete ignorant and don‚Äôt know anything there talking about they told me everything I already knew.. so sad that the only mail service I have is this one"
"Update to my previous post in regards to the amazing delivery service provided by Canada Post. My parcel arrived Sunday in Moncton (Dieppe Mail Processing Plant) after sitting in Toronto for over a week. Expedited parcel sent on January 29th.

The expected delivery day was originally the 5th, and then the 9th and behold, as of today, it's ""Expected delivery: Item delayed ‚Äî stay tuned for updates"". Sounds like a sick cartoon. Anyhow, here I am down the road waiting for the Moncton MPP to foward my parcel to the local LC Depot for delivery. But, based on their ""stay tuned"" message, I'm resigned to having to wait another week or two."
Can you believe I‚Äôm still waiting !? They updated my tracking finally yesterday apparently went from Mississauga to Montreal then the Ajax ... was supposed to be delivered yesterday and ofcourse didn‚Äôt show up and say delayed again ! It‚Äôs been a month and a half since they initially gave me a delivery date that was delayed. This is bull
"I‚Äôm so fed up with Canada post, they are rude when dealing with and no one can update u on ur package that hasn‚Äôt change in over week with a 3 day service ticket and still nothing, I don‚Äôt understand how u can‚Äôt deliver a rug that is bigger then me on time when it‚Äôs a two hour delivery max, I‚Äôm tired of hearing the excuses u give when u are the only delivery service out with these issues, I will be calling again today to have this figured out and I‚Äôm not getting off the phone until I finally have some answers, because so far I‚Äôve heard so many different reasons but still nothing is done, I ordered my item January 30th from Amazon.ca it was shipped on Feb 2nd with nothing since it now the 10 of Feb, from Mississauga Ontario to London Ontario, Your policies are horrible and your service tickets clearly do absolutely nothing, this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, I am honestly so glad Amazon was on a 3 way call and heard everything in how u handle situations and have removed you as a delivery service with my account, more companies need to jump on this idea so finally something will be done with Canada post, I don‚Äôt think they will enjoy loosing them as a business but what do expect when ur the longest running delivery/ mail service out there with the most issues, horrible service and terrible reviews, looks like Canada post needs to be investigated as it‚Äôs certainly NOT BECAUSE OF COVID and u need to stop using that as an excuse for ur poor service, there a problem with ur company and how u handle the situation, maybe if u as a company communicated with one another and worked as a team u wouldn‚Äôt have as many issues as u do, this is a huge factor in what is one of the main reasons ur company is failing"
"Slow government workers, absolute joke of a company. Employees are lazy and entitled, would be better suited working at Burger King."
"Complete $hit. Look at the reviews!
Hello! Canada post wake the fuk up!
This is $hit storm to the highest degree,
Is this even a company or just a giant scam? Covid my ass, Canada post has always had issues and it‚Äôs 2021. So sad"
"It was already bad enough prior to Covid-19, and did not imagine it could get any worse.

My two recent parcels delivered through Canada Post has been awful.
1. During Christmas, my parcel was being shipped from Ontario to BC. It took them about.... 3 weeks to process the order, not to mention the total delivery duration took 5 weeks. (The ""Delivery Standard was within a week, and yes, I paid for priority shipping)

2. Recently ordered a parcel, again coming from Ontario to BC. It's not a heavy volume season but my status for tracking hasn't been updated for almost 2 weeks. When contacting the support, they tell me my parcel is ""In Transit"" since Jan 25 to Feb 9th. Now, that's almost 2 weeks in transit time so I assume they're going on a vacation around the country with my parcel?

On a more serious note, they don't have any better excuse than ""Covid-19"" as if it just started last week. I understand processing them with health protocols will add delays but 2 weeks for an update? Really Canada Post?

Worst service ever, if you can, pay the extra money for a different shipping company. Saves you all the stress, which is definitely worth it in my opinion. These guys have 0 accountability and responsibility. It's almost a scam with their ""Delivery Standard"", what's the point of listing a ""Standard"" that they cannot follow EVER (before Covid and after)."
My canada post package send off from January 14 2021 to deliver 19 January not delivered still in process no update nth move what he'll is going in mw532549512ca
"Worst services in Canada at this point. Been waiting for for a parcel no updates, it just said expected delivery that day. waited 3 more days. When the guy arrived I was ready with my ID but he just gave me the paper telling me he can't deliver it and I have to go tomorrow to pick the little box at pharmacy. Disappointed I was."
"So today I received the 15th package with the wrong address, 15 with in a years time.

Some of them are simply a number or two off from my own while some are from entirely different sub devision.

I know for some at canada post the square block square hole scenario can be difficult to figure out but sadly you keep failing.

I have no idea where my packages are but I know where someone else's is, it's in my house. Luckily I'm a decent person and try to make sure they get where they're going, I wish canada post did the same.

Personally canada post should not be getting anyone's tax dollars because clearly, 15 packages later, they have not even tried to improve.

Before you jump to conclusions, yea I did call in complaints at first, then gave up and would hand deliver the packages my self, with out compensation mind you. How ever regardless of complaint it keeps happening. Even toddlers learn faster then this."
I booked international priority item to Lahore Pakistan on Feb 3. 2021. I was told expected delivery on 8Feb. Item remained in Toronto for 3 days and further 3 days in Memphis Fedex. I am cursing Canada Post snd Fedex. My item contained time sensitive documents International Priority charged 140 $. My foot..üò™üò™üò©üòè
Been waiting for my package since Jan 26th and still not here. Was being shipped from mississauga to Kitchener (45 min drive) its now in Montreal. Like what are they doing.
"Trash service. Actually, my trash removal is 110% more reliable than Canada Post. The service is complete joke. 3 day shipping turns into 2.5 weeks. There is nobody to hold accountable for this terrible joke of a service. Go figure with it being government run. Also, let's get rid of those group mailboxes. What a complete failure. What a waste of tax payers money."
"Sending an express post item that is supposed to be delivered in 3 days and it's been over 2 weeks now. The tracker just says it's pending delivery.

I could have walked to the destination quicker then sending it with these clowns."
"I'm waiting for a parcel from Pickering Ontario that was shipped on Feb1st. Canada post finally claimed to have only the ""electronic information submitted by shipper"" received on Feb3. At the same time Canada Post said that the expected delivery was to be Feb 5th. Delivery time has since been moved up to Feb 9th. However only the ""electronic information submitted by shipper"" label is what is indicated and nothing else. No parcel shipped indicated, even though they've actually had the parcel on Feb 1st. An interesting side note on Amazon regarding my parcel indicates that since Feb 3rd, my parcel states that there is a ""delay due to external factors"" out of Calgary Alberta. Now I'm really confused. I was under the impression that my parcel hasn't even left Pickering yet. Edmonton is its final destination by the way. Now I find out that many parts of Canada Post's website seems to be down for the last several hours. Now I can't even monitor what little (if any) progress there may be. Surely it can't be the supposed Covid 19 emergency out of Mississauga on Jan 20th. That was over 19 days ago. Is Canada Post's operation that fragile that the slightest mishap gums up the whole works? I'm beginning to think so. No wonder more and more people are going to courier services. One more thing. I paid for an expedited parcel service. I guess I'm not getting it."
"For regular mail, Canada Post is just fine. They really do suck at shipping packages. I've had multiple issues with packages missing or taking way too long to ship. One package shipped from Ontario and arrived to my city in Saskatchewan. The next arrival scan said it was in Calgary, Alberta. Another separate package shipped from Ontario again, arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, almost to Saskatchewan. The next arrival scan said Montreal, Quebec. I had to re-order my package, which arrived a week later. Then in about 3-4 weeks the original package showed up unknowingly. I've also had issues with packages sitting for days not moving or being delivered. I finally realize why people want Canada Post shut down because their service is terrible, including their so called customer service. I contacted customer support and all they said is that there is nothing they can do about my package that was sent 3 provinces away. Not sure who they hire for employees, but they should be given a map of the country and teach them to correctly read Canadian addresses."
"Always late.. Always. For god's sake just put the estimated delivery date later so people don't get disapointed... Add a week and you probably wont be wrong most of the time. Also your tracking is completly useless, says nothing at all except estimated delivery date which is as you might've understood, wrong."
Waiting since January 23rd for an express post item. Supposed to be on the truck weeks ago. Went to the mailbox today as it said delivered but it's not there. Horrible company
Always delays and false delivery emails. I just contacted Customer Service for the second time today that a parcel that their tracking claims to have delivered was not. I just received my service tickets and waiting for the results of the investigations.
THEY NEVER BUZZ. THEY NEVER KNOCK.I work from home and I know for A FACT that they don‚Äôt bother to even see if you‚Äôre home. They just leave the paper and go. THIS HAPPENED TOO MANY TIMES NOW. I‚Äôll never buy from a company that use POSTE CANADA. Thank you for making me leave my house each time when you can JUST BUZZ.
Post lady at the counter was very inattentive and rude. She asked how she could help but was looking away from me putting a bandaid on and then she took a few minutes and asked again how she could help. Then she was very monotone and rude when I was asking questions.
Worst service i have ever seen waiting for my package to arrive since one and half months called them like 4 times to listen that they are sorry and cannot help
"I purchased jacket and shipped by Canda Post, and it was returned because of no receiver.
I stayed at home all day, no one delivered and gave me any notification at door.
Canada Post is worst of worst!"
"Every single time I use cp it's severyley delayed or never shows

Been waiting since the 20th of Jan and it hasn't even left where it was dropped off by the shipper. Nothing but excuses and pushed dates with cp they are seriously the worst"
"They ask for more money so they can provide junkier service but as Canadians we are stupid we have better parcel delivery services like FedEx, canpar and DHL that all are 80%better then Canada Post. Let's get rid of the crap and bring on the good."
"Worst worst worst, absolute nonsense
A complete failure"
"It's unbelievable how crappy their service is!! Anytime I order a package and the company uses Canada Post, guaranteed there are delays every time!! Why give me an estimated delivery date only to miss that target date every time?? Thanks for being so on the ball! The sad part is about all the complaints is that they don't give a rat's ass!"
"Ordered a package From the end of January. The shipper had sent using express post and now it‚Äôs gonna take over two weeks for the package to come in? Such a useless company with terrible service and no help anywhere. I can‚Äôt wait to see this company in the ground after you guys lose all of your freaking money! 40$ extra for 2-3 days shipping when it‚Äôs not gonna happen ever, worst company in Canada."
"I recently ordered some stuffs with 2 friends from different Canadian companies that relied on Canada Post. As of today, NONE of us has received our package - the expected delivery date kept getting pushed back without much updates. AVOID this ""company"" at all costs!"
"From Florida to Canada 4 days -2000km..... usps
50km expedited parcel 6 days -canada post... Horrible company......"
Why the hell do we funds this corporation? Packages are always days late and good luck with customer service...
"I made a purchase from a company in the US. The parcel was shipped to Canada where it was subcontracted to Canada Post (by USPS) to deliver. Canada Post delivered it to the wrong address. I put in a complaint and they looked for it .... but of course had NO idea where they might have delivered it. They have informed me that I cannot make a claim, only the original sender can make a claim. Yeah like that is going to happen! No foreign company is going to instigate an investigation into a lost parcel unless it has a BIG dollar amount. I would strongly advise people who are having items shipped from other countries to pay the extra $ to have it shipped by a PRIVATE COMPANY as they are more accountable and have fewer delivery screw-ups. This is NOT the first time Canada Post has delivered one of my parcels to a random address. They claim they will investigate, but no one seems to be able to tell me what that process is. Do they knock on the doors of all my neighbours (who may or may not be home)? Do they phone my neighbours? Or do they simply ask the letter carrier where they think they delivered it incorrectly to .... like they would remember? Why don't they just be honest and say that if we did not have the parcel insured, we can just go @#$^* ourselves and stop bothering them. DO NOT USE CANADA POST if there is any other way to ship anything!"
"A letter was sent via expedited mail from Prince George to Parksville, BC last Friday, Jan 29/21. It is now Friday, February 5/21, & I still have not received this letter. I enquired at the post office in Parksville, providing them with the tracking number, to determine when I might expect to receive my mail. I was told the delay is because of cleaning procedures in place at the Richmond postal outlet due to Covid. I hopefully should receive this next Mon., Feb 8/21 or Tues., Feb 9th. I'm very disappointed with the lack of customer service, & feel the originating postal outlet should have at least communicated to the sender any anticipated delays. Next time, we'll agree on regular mail & save the additional costs."
"I never leave a review on any company, but this Canadian Company, unfortunately, I had to. What a shame, I feel bad to know that this company is a Canadian Company.

First of all, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, I paid $25 for Express Delivery (2 days shipping) I didn‚Äôt even receive my parcel yet and it‚Äôs been 3 weeks of that!

I called at their Customer Service number, more than 2 hours of waiting time and when I got the line, the employee I spoke to cut the line.

I don‚Äôt know if I got unlucky, but reading the reviews today, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one facing this MASSIVE problem.

Guys we seriously have to do something about it.."
Garbage service will avoid at all costs. Such a pathetic excuse for a crown corporation. Irresponsible lying waste .
If you have a choice to use another shipping agent then do so. Canada post is impossible to deal with and customer support is not supportive and will not go out of the way to assist you.
"What a waste of tax payers money, this company takes and takes. why does it take 18 days for a package to go from Edmonton to Mississauga. still not delivered as of this morning, track shows it should of been delivered jan 28. date of delivery is sitting in limbo since that date.. time to get competent managers and staff"
"I'm clicked on one star only because it would not allow me to have zero. 2 weeks ago I brought a brand new Ipad, still in the box to Canada Post to ship to my daughter in the UK. I told them, and they could see, it was an Ipad I was shipping, and asked if there would be an issue and they went ahead and accepted the item for shipping, and charged me over $100. Yesterday the item was returned to me because it was refused for air transport. When I checked with Canada Post and asked for a refund, since their employee said it was no problem. They said they could not do a refund as it's my responsibility to know what can and can't be shipped. Which I thought I had covered by asking the question of their employee. Canada Post should be ashamed by their actions, but unfortunately I don't believe they give it a second thought. SCAMMERS!!!!!"
xpresspost paid 20.00 from toronto to Winnipeg..guaranteed 2 days ..it is now a week and they have no clue..what a scam
"Ordered a package from a city less than a two hour drive away. Took over a week to get into my city, then tried to deliver it to the wrong door. Useless."
Was suppose to get my package 4 days after it was shipped. They sent it the opposite direction to a holding facility and are holding my package hostage for 8 days.
"I got a package from China quicker than I have been able to get one from Montreal to Toronto.

What a joke Canada Post is. The most frustrating part is no updates on potential delivery date or what the revised delivery standard might be given the issues they are experiencing. They need to think about doing exit scans when leaving facilities, as I am not sure if my item is still stuck in Montreal or is somewhere in the Mississauga facility. It really shows that they are inefficient and ineffective."
"They have almost NEVER delivered a package on time, let alone during the pandemic.

I actually think they just let dogs run their entire system. No automation at all it seems.

Package STILL says expected at the end of today, even after delivery hours.

They have always waited until the last minute to say it's delayed, now they don't even give you the courtesy of responding to you like a human.

Live chat told me the exact same thing as the bot."
"Every single time they handle one of my deliveries, it takes 1.5 to 2 times the time they say it will take to arrive. The ""Expected delivery"" date they show seems to have no real meaning as often the package is not even out for delivery by that date.

They also have the strangest delivery people. They often do not even knock which usually doesn't bother me, as they can just leave the package in front of the door and I will get it later, but recently they started leaving notes instead of my packages which means I have to go to the post office to get whatever I ordered while I was actually home. I guess they just don't feel like bringing my packages up to my door.

Honestly, I often choose to pay a bit more if other options are available, as Canada Post is by far the least reliable service and often has the worst delivery people out of every other services."
"I'm SO sorry I HAD to give a 1 star review to write this!! For 2 days now my tracking number says to be delivered by the end of day...STILL no delivery. At Christmas it took from Dec. 07 to the first week of Jan. to deliver at package I sent from Toronto to Surrrey, B.C. for over 20.00...a handmade scarf!! If it was up to me my package that's coming (who knows when) certainly wouldn't be using Canada Post!! The prices keep going up yet their service leaves ALOT to be desired.."
"I love being Canadian, but Canada post is a national embarrassment! Even worse than Air Canada! üêå
I believe the staff are trying, but the system in broken!"
"I used to live in the UK and I thought Royal Mail was bad. Then I moved to Canada and experienced Canada Post.
How do you actually deliver your mail? By horse and cart? Tied to the shell of a snail? Toss it in the air and hope the wind blows it?
It's been 2 weeks since my package was apparently dispatched. The Delivery Status on my tracking link begins ""Delays can happen for many reasons.""
Good to see Canada Post has as little respect for its customers as we do for them."
"This is the worst customer service from Canada Post that I‚Äôve ever experienced. I‚Äôm expecting a delivery of merchandise, according to the tracking, it said expected 1 to 11 days for delivery, then it was updated to will be delivered on 29th at the end of day, but the parcel has never been delivered and it was changed to‚Äù deliver delayed- stay tune for an update‚Äù The parcel has been in transit for 2 weeks at the facility in Mississauga with no delivery attempt. This is totally unacceptable."
Wish I could give zero stars. I don‚Äôt think Canada post has ever delivered a package on time I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they would put a realistic delivery standard they say 1-3 days for express shipping and I paid extra for it to get it in time but of course save your money and don‚Äôt pay for express. It‚Äôs taken 10 days for a 3 day package and is still not in.
"People keep rising against crown establishments. We do not consent to the abuse and corruption. END THE BIG GAME OF MONOPOLY.

RESIST AND BITE!

- No Disrespect to C. Post employees -"
My mom delivered me a package from home as I am studying at school now. I only live an hour and a half away. So my mom sent me the package more than a week ago and now it just seems everyday my package keeps getting delayed more and more. Let me remind you I LIVE only a HOUR AND A HALF AWAY. It says it‚Äôs been in transit for like 6 days now. Honestly this is the worst delivery service out there right now and I have no doubt about it. I legit could have started walking to get my package probably would still receive it before Canada post delivers it.
"THE fact everyone dealing with the same issue we need to ban them, this is crazy.. u can't offer express option to customers knowing there's covid... that's a legit scam and I swear to God I'll be taking legal actions cause ain't no way your going to scam this much ppl and get away with it... boycott this scam company"
Canada post have lost my two parcels in last 3 years. Recently they loose one of my parcel and updated as delivered in their system. Even they don‚Äôt have information who received it. Their local staff in Medicine Hat office has worse attitude and don‚Äôt know how to respond a customer who has issue.
"I had a package coming from out of country and it had traveled between 9 cities. It was then sent to Ottawa and had to sit there for a bit due to Covid which is understandable. It was then transferred into Canada Post in Mississauga.... and BOOM they lose it. It was suppose to be delivered on Feb 1st i asked for a time frame, the lady said ""it says 8pm so you will get it before 8pm"" Guess what.... it never came. the next day it still says ""in transit"".... still didn't show up. Called them and they said they put a ""ticket to locate the package"" still not delivered. I said to the lady why is it that every other delivery company seem to be doing fine with delivering products and fast... but the company that has out country's name in it can't do the simple task of bringing people their packages. I understand the covid issues trust me but if everything is being held at customs then there would not be an overload of items as each day some are released. How about pay attention more."
"Canada Post needs to offer a lower-cost, tracked parcel offering for domestic (Canadian) shipments. Today, we sent a 1lb package to SOUTH AUSTRALIA from Ontario at a cost of just under $30. Then, we sent a 1lb package to Perth, Ontario - 5 hours away - at a cost of $23.81. Granted, the delivery timeframe is more speedy within Canada, but Canadians need an option for sending domestic parcels where ship cost is a more important factor than speed of delivery. It should not cost almost the same to send a small tracked parcel to South Australia from Ontario as it does to ship it within our own Province. Outrageous domestic shipping costs need review."
"Just gonna add to the pile of crap that is Canada post, retailer gave no other choice so shipped Canada post EXPRESS, yea like that means anything other than a higher price tag. Tracking, updated Feb 2 5am, expected Feb 3 end of day, here it is Feb 3 end of day, no tracking update, no package. I personally have taken all shipping options I need or use to other places, ups or fed ex. Won't use Purolator as they a branch of Canada post. Of course, its covids fault, guess it has been for last 15 years of garbage customer service and shipping. Weird."
"Canada post is a joke! They are the worst delivery service in Canada, hands down. Whatever expected delivery they give you, add at least 2 weeks to that. They don‚Äôt update the tracking information. The tracking has said my package has been in the same place FOR 5 DAYS and all it said is ‚Äúitem delayed - stay tuned for updates‚Äù without any other information, not even a new approximate delivery date! I‚Äôm so disappointed, especially considering the item I‚Äôm waiting on is a gift and it is extremely unlikely that I will be receiving it on time now. They try to blame covid for the delays, yet Fedex, UPS, and Purolator still manage to get your packages to you within a reasonable time. From now on I will not be ordering through anyone that ships with Canada Post because this is absolutely pathetic."
Charging people for speedy delivery and not fulfilling that promise is already a shameful practice; not giving refunds for service un-rendered is just criminal. I wish they could be taken to court but they are a government agency.
"One star is already way more than what that company deserves. 5 days no update, the last update I have is that it was received at the facilities but now 5 days later its still there collecting dust. I've been told twice that I would receive it today to just be despointed the evening when it's not out of delivery yet, now postpone the delivery date twice. Opened a ticket with their support(waste of time) and they basicly give me the same prerecorded line that their robot is giving or that they will contact me on a week if still nothing. It would've been faster if they sent a dude biking all the way from there to deliver my package. This company s*cks."
My package arrived in Mississauga on Jan. 2 now its been a month and my item still there. They keep on telling me that in 3 to 7 days I will receive my item it's been a month now!
I have personally used Canada Post on a number of occasions. It turned out there was a 50/50 probability of the recipient receiving the package in a timely fashion. I stopped using them because they were completely unreliable. Unfortunately a number of businesses we order merchandise from still use them which we find terribly frustrating. We are slowly weeding them out. The latest was the Google Store. We will not order anything from them going forward as they must know this is a problem and have chosen profit over customer satisfaction.
"Frustrated Beyond Words!
Paid the 12 month fee to have my mail forwarded till June 27/21!! I arrived home to find my mail just lying on the step outside my door !!! I recevied my old age pension for November at the of end December!!!! I went to speak with them and they said they didnt see anything on line that said I requested mail Forward!! REALLY!!! Well you took the payment!!! They said to call the 1-800 number !!! Well that was a waste of time !!! I do have the #that says I requested!! So bad!!!
Not to mention I am missing bank statements Credit card bills! ETC Hint !! stop worrying about selling coins on your voice mail and do your job!!!!"
Just the absolute service. You‚Äôre reading this so you know.
This is now the third package they have lost misplaced or stolen. I swear these drivers are incompetent. The package got to georgetown then somehow got lost or misplaced. This is unacceptable you bunch of lazy public parasites.
"A piece of sh.. service, never be on time and always says "" Slightly delay""; is 5 or 6 days delay slightly?
They fool the customer. Hopefully it shut down soon completely."
"Express post item has been stuck in Etobicoke, in transit, for 10 days now. 10 days. Express post is meant to be 1-2 days. What is going on?? Thousands of 1 star reviews, is there no investigation occurring?"
"Item I purchased cost me $2,700 and was sent fully insured 3 weeks ago from BC to Ontario. Tracking just shows ‚ÄòAccepted at post office‚Äô

Update: Just got it 3 weeks from the day it was posted."
Horrific from my point of view however I am fully aware that there are many others with way worse cases. I bought a note 20 ultra off best buy and my package is now over a week late. This is an abomination to Canada
Canada Post is the worst. Unfriendly and Damages to the Packages. Like comm'on have some Decentcey. I go with Purolator or UPS. Canada Post you have a lot of Improving to do ASAP
"Product took 3 weeks and was damaged and they just did not care. It‚Äôs a shame they use Canada in there name because they suck, can I give a zero"
Stuck in transit in Etobicoke for 8 days now. Express post.
"I've had this company send the THIRD package because the first package went missing since Nov 6, 2020. Dec 11, 2020 was the second box that was sent to me - Both still not delivered. Now Jan 27th, 2021, 3rd box shipped - Waiting to see if Feb 3rd is actually when they deliver.

Oh yes, A different package shipped Jan 20th, was expected to receive it between Jan 27th - 28th. Still no updates on that.

You go through their messaging service or call them and all they can do is create a ticket for you which solves NOTHING. I've created tickets for these and all I got was an e-mail a week later stating the same thing - ""Our investigation into your request indicates that no scan has been uploaded to the Canada Post tracking system to indicate delivery of your item.""

Thanks."
"CANADA POST -DO NOT OFFER OR CHARGE FOR SERVICES THAT YOU CAN‚ÄôT DELIVER ON! I paid $47.83 for priority overnight service which is advertised on the Canada Post website. I was told that it could be delivered within 3 to 4 business days due to COVID-19.
I had important documents that my spouse needed and as my spouse was leaving the country to go overseas for work.
Why is that you can mail a letter via regular mail from one province and it arrives in another province in 3 business days during X-mas time and yet you pay an exuberant amount for ‚ÄúPRIORITY‚Äù service and your item is in limbo after 6 business days. Are you kidding me?

What does ‚ÄúPriority‚Äù service mean to Canada Post? Why would you accept/charge for a service you know that there is no chance to deliver it within a reasonable time frame even with COVID-19 delays.
Canada Post needs a major overhaul, it seems there is excuse after excuse whether it is holiday parcel backlog or COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 has been around for a year, you would think within that time period that the employer would have safety measures in place for their staff.
If you have priority documents to send with a limited time frame, take note of the 95% poor reviews on this forum and use another courier service.
I will never use Canada Post again, unreliable especially for overnight priority service, just horrible!"
"Canada post send me an email saying the package was delivered, I checked my box mail as soon as the email was sent. The package was never there. I have never received it till this day. I have reached out to them but nothing. So no package and no refund. Worst delivery company that I have ever seen."
This is outrageous to say the least. I am not only dissatisfied but have pure frustration. I ordered a package one 5 weeks ago and its sitting at the warehouse only 11 min away. They won't let me pick out MY package. They also tend to process a package through the same facility multiple times so your order gets delayed!
"I AM EXPECTING ONE DELIVERY AND ONE RETURN, NONE OF THEM SHOWS TRACKING STATUS, I HAVE OPEN TICKET NUMBER MORE THAN 15 DAYS STILL NO NEWS, i AM SURE THEY ARE STEALING PACKAGES AND THEY DONT INVESTIGATE,THEY DON'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR, THERE IS NO OPTION TO WRITE REVIEW IF YOU DONT STAR. CANADA POST ARE THEIFT.DO NOT SEND YOUR PACKAGE WITH CANADA POST."
By far the worst of all delivery services. If you have a choice I recommend anyone else.
"Canada Post doesn't deserve a 1 star rating, it deserves a negative 5 star rating! If you can't keep up with the demand hire more workers! The delays are absolutely unacceptable. One of my packages sat at the Kelowna depot for a week before I got it. Another package took almost a month from Ontario when it only should take a week. Get your sheit together Canada Post!!!!!"
"One star is too much for Canada post. Their delivery and customer service are both trash. They don‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs time, I was to receive a package that I paid priority overnight shipping for, 27 bucks. The package was supposed to be here on the 27th of January as per their site. I waited at home during the given time frame, nothing. I had to be off work as the package was very important. I call and ask, no one has a clue. I got a service ticket made and they updated my package delivery to the 28th, nothing again. I look on the site and it‚Äôs now mentioning delivery for the 4th of February. How is that priority shipping? I could have drove down to Niagara Falls and picked it up 4 times by now."
"I could actually give no star if it was a option. This is the worst. I have had the same package delayed now going on almost a whole month. Everytime I try to call to figure this out, they either say they are busy or the package will arrive soon. It should have arrived a month ago.. I will be choosing a new carrier for now on for parcels and such. For uses of my goods that are worth some money."
"I‚Äôm waiting on three separate packages from canada post. One is stuck in Montreal for the last week, one it‚Äôs stuck somewhere in Mississauga which I should‚Äôve likely received on Monday and lastly, the other one is stuck in somewhere in Richmond BC and I understand that one‚Äôs gonna take a little bit longer because it‚Äôs in a different province but even so right now it‚Äôs ridiculously too slow to be getting mail right now! I‚Äôm getting stuff from Amazon or even third-party shipping services such as landmark getting delivered for quicker with no serious delays or nothing I got them within a reasonable timeframe. Canada post seriously needs to hire more workers and stop blaming the stupid virus on everything because honestly the room even slow even before the virus screwed everything up and companies need to start offering more faster shipping options because it‚Äôs indirectly affecting their business in a lot of people may not wanna buy online now because Canada post is extremely slow! If I could get things less than a week from other places Canada Post can do the same thing. Enough is enough already! At this point I honestly can‚Äôt wait till I could shop in person again because the delivery times at this point is not worth it and a lot of these businesses and local businesses are not doing well right now."
"Outrageously expensive, outrageously slow, unbelievably uncaring and a master of finding excuses and reasons to blame others. No self respect, no pride and no dignity. The worst postal service I have ever used. They should just cease and the government should privatise the service. If at all possible, just avoid."
Just horrible absolutely atrocious I wish they would shut down so somebody else could step in and even do a completely terrible job and it would still be better
"Terrible service. Canada post dont take any liability or responsibility when packages are lost. They dont even call you back to give you any updates on tickets. Plus, they hang up the phone on you when you make a valid point againts their backward policy."
"Would rate zero but it's not an option. Would love to see Canada Post be privatized just so it finally goes under. Calling their service ""abysmal"" would be a compliment. The absolute worst - they are the bowel cancer of delivery services."
"Just awful. They seem to only hire lazy incompetent losers to work there. Constantly late packages, they just say out for delivery on the expected date but it doesn‚Äôt actually get delivered until a few days later. Horrible company with disgusting employees."
"On the bright side, you guys hold the title for most hated public service on the planet."
"not good service at all, been waiting for a small package for over 3 weeks now and keeps getting delayed"
"If I had an option to give 0 star I would but I can't. With the virus as an excuse, these people aren't delivering the packages on time or just simply lose them. And good luck calling the customer service people. They don't give a hoot and one manager even said... Well deal with it and wait. Why companies are using them to ship their products is crazy. I get retail store that use uber to deliver their products within 24 hours. Canada post would let your item seats at their warehouse for an entire week before they even bother processing it. And if you want to create a ticket, forget about that. They tell you that you have to wait 2 weeks after the supposed delivery date to even begin filling a claim. That's disgusting. They shouldn't be allowed to call themself Canada anything."
"Canada Post has absolutely horrible service, people are lucky to recieve any mail, my personal mail is regularly delivered to the wrong address, i ordered items online that are not delivered in a timely manner i am currently waiting for a package that was in montreal 3 weeks ago and is still apparently in transit. I have recieved bills at my home that were 6 months old and some are never delivered. At work i have recieved mail marked return to sender that had been in the mail system for over a year, this has happened several times. Their prices continue to rise every year and the service they claim to be providing get worse every year."
Please Canada Post shut your doors already so people stop using you to ship stuff. Their delivery standard is 10-15 days in the same Province with express delivery. Absolute garbage union workers that the tax payers still have to support
"CANADA POST IS THE WORST SERVICE EVER. THEY DON'T REFUSE ANY MAIL TO ANYONE, THATS WHY THEY HAVE A WAREHOUSE THAT IS FULL, EVERYTHING GETS LOST AND THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, LOST ITEMS, BECAUS ETHEY DON'T REALLY CARE. AS LONG AS THEY GET PAID, THEY REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT SERVICE"
"Canada post is much like our current prime minister. Sits around all day and does absolutely nothing then comes up with a bullsh#t excuse. Do not use Canada post to ship anything of importance, they will let you down 100% of the time. You're better off going with a carrier pigeon with a broken wing."
They use every excuse including Covid to charge ridiculous prices and yes condone and accept bad service....I will deliver the package myself..YOUR SERVICE STINKS!! A Federal government culture of mediocrity and gross incompetence.. Thank you Canada Post.. You have proven again that you should be PRIVATIZED.
"Canada Post is the worst. They provide the wrong delivery status info online.
The status that I received for my package on their online website mentioned that it was ‚Äúout for delivery by the end of the day‚Äù..They weren‚Äôt able to deliver it so it mentioned out for delivery the next day and the day after. Now it says that the package is in their facility.And will provide information once they get updates. My question is why did it go back to the facility when it was out for delivery???

If it was in the facility this whole time then do not say that is out for delivery. Because that is lying to the customer Providing the wrong information you should give proper and correct updates!!!"
"Ordered B.C. death certificate from B.C. vital statistics(located in Victoria B.C.). Couriered it for extra cost . Called vital statistics today, as hasn‚Äôt shown today . (I‚Äôm in Vancouver B.C.)They say it shipped from Victoria on Monday (January 25th)morning. Give me tracking number and delivery date . Thursday( January 28th) . I am confused . 4 days from Victoria to Vancouver ? That is less than 4 hours ( mega bad traffic accounted for) travel time ,2 hours of it being a ferry ride. I call Canada post . They say yes , correct . I raise above question. How can it take so long ? Especially couriered. Long story bridged, Canada Post blames vital statistics ( for reimbursement of courier fee, as that delivery time was not what was indicated ) vital statistics blames Canada post of course . And no one I could speak to on both ends. Typical government. I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered if I knew it was Canada post . I knew it would be a waste of money . They have lost MANY packages of mine over the years . Anyone ordering from B.C. vital statistics , don‚Äôt waste your money on courier delivery . It will take just as long as regular mail, and you won‚Äôt get your money back."
Worst shipping option you can choose. CP is such a shame for Canada. Destroying businesses with their bad service. Destroyed one of my online shops and going to destroy my second one. Avoid if possible.
"You'd think after being in business for 150 years Canada Post would have there act together, and you'd think wrong. Paying extra for guaranteed delivery times is like flushing money down the toilet."
"You guys are the worst delivery service out there!
ALL my parcels (9 total) are late from many days for the past 4 weeks, I understand the current covid situation, but this is part of everyone's life now, you guys should of adjusted by now!!! To bad big company's still use your service, believe me if I had the choice I would go with Intelcom or FedEx, they are 100% more reliable than you, and deliver on time.

A really unhappy customer."
"never arrive on time sometime loss package sometime they end up in a different final location . just pure disappointed ok if canada only has one option for delivery which is canada post then we wouldn't be complain. but there are fed ex purolator ups dhl those are 100x better like they give you an estimate delivery and that will be 95% correct estimate. but with canada post hell no 2 day delivery you can expect it to be 2 week,."
"How about this folks? If you shop online, before you pay for the item ask the retailer who they use to
ship their products. Cancel the order and tell them that
you cannot do business with companies that ship with
Canada POST .If enough people did this, retailers would have to find other delivery methods.
Not only does Canada Post take forever, they dont
deliver packages to individuals who live in multi family
complexes such as apartment buildings. It is too much
trouble for the mailperson to find your name on the occupant board of your building and buzz you to let you
know that they have a package for you. Even when your
buzzcode is on the package, they leave an attempted
delivery slip so that you can pick it up somewhere else.
Your only other option is to wait in the lobby all day to see if they show up. Customer service assures me that
this is Canada Posts attempt to ""keep everybody safe"".
Makes perfect sense. Send 10people to a little drug store to wait in line to pick up a package and expose
the entire store to the thing we are shopping online to
avoid. Going out in a pandemic.
You have to be a genius to figure this out?
All the guy had to do was buzz me and leave the package in the lobby for me to pick up.
Any other business that had as many bad reviews and
unhappy customers, and we are customers, as Canada Post wouldnt be in business for long . Consumers have
power when they get it together ..dont use them and tell everyone you do business with that you cant do
business with them if they ship with Canada Post"
A very small box was shipped from Michigan on Dec 28.2020. It got to Montreal and then sent to Mississauga distribution and sat there for 15 days. They keep changing the delivery date. The reason is the Covid 19 and their protocols. Amazon and UPS are so much better than this and they are working to the same protocols. You can't talk to anyone just the very silly chat computer who can do nothing for you. Totally incompetent company!!!!
"Ive had 3 packages in the past couple months that have been scanned as delivered but never were. They go to my mail box which is locked so it‚Äôs not as though it was just left at my door and stolen. I contacted Canada post and they created a service ticket for the first one and it turns out it wasn‚Äôt even in my town! Even though it was shown as here and delivered. The second is being looked into and the 3rd I was told because it‚Äôs been more than 3 days they have to deal with the seller, who has specified to me already that once it‚Äôs scanned as delivered they consider it delivered and that‚Äôs that. These were all express post deliveries, customers pay to have that you would think they would pay better attention to scanning and delivery."
"Do not use Canada post if you‚Äôre receiving a very important package because I have lost way too many packages and you‚Äôll be waiting (to receive your package if you do) for days, weeks or sometimes even months. Sucks that in Canada we have such a terrible mail system. If you need a life saving medication which just so happens, needs to be mailed through Canada post. Good luck. You‚Äôre probably gonna end up dying."
"My package came back it's says because it's more then 2kg(should less then 2kg)....
My package was 1.760kg...somewhere the scale wasn't working well..
The customer service told me to send it one more zime but get out from my package 150grm in a case if the scale its somewhere in Toronto still won't be able to measure the tight weight...
I did that ,but i had to pay $4 more!!! Why??? I don't know ...the lady in a postal iffice said that she understands my conserns but she don't know why i need to pay $4 more.....??!!!"
"Jan 23, 2021

The Canada Post mail delivery is not the greatest
Parcels are not delivered on
the estimated time ., really
terrible"
"Canada Post deceives me every. single. time!
It is frustrating dealing with them, it always ends in 'suck it up buttercup'.

Delivery dates that keep changing throughout the entire process, including AFTER they were supposed to be delivered, little to no customer service, post office hours are useless, delivery times are sooooo sloooooooooowwww it may actually be quicker to hand deliver a parcel across the country on foot.

Getting a package from anywhere in the world goes quickly but as soon as it hits the Canada post stage, EVERYTHING stops.

""Unforeseeable factors"" is their favorite excuse for every circumstance.

They are basically just a little notch above being completely useless."
"Amazon delivery to my rural area, generally 12 hours from ordering. Canada Post xpresspost says 2-3 business days for ""regional."" Mississauga to north of Barrie, a two hour drive, says four days off the hop, then five, then tracking says nine.. guess what, still not here and its Friday, again! My guess, I'll have a sticker on my door on Tuesday that says I can PICK IT UP MYSELF Wednesday! I will NEVER use this company again for myself, or order from companies that ship via. I'm done, totally useless and nothing but headaches and hoops to jump through.. seriously, how can Amazon have it in my hands in less than 12 hours and these morons can't get it done in almost two WEEKS! How is there not a 0 star rating."
"I sent a package 10 x 12 on December 2020 my mother just received package today January 22,2021 it took one month to get package from Ontario to BC. I did not insure the package and gift cards are missing I am never using Canada post ever again. Good bye forever .I also spent 28 dollars to have a surprise show up 3 weeks later than I paid for, I am done."
The fastest delivery company in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It costs one century to deliver items to your hands!
"I have no words to explaine the stupidity of canada-post !! NOW, if you think that you must take a shower each time you have to touch an enveloppe then this fake virus propagande will put your job's down pretty quick ...i tell you that.start thinking with you head now and stop taking express money free when you have a maximum speed of delivery that is of 3 weeks from vancouvert to trois-riviere in express mode.that is call pure scam=fraud."
"Absolutely terrible, lacking common sense. Why do they feel the need to stuff big packages in community mailboxes to where I can‚Äôt even turn the key to open it. if you need to stuff the package in for it to fit how am I suppose to get it out? Where is the common sense in that. I just don‚Äôt get why they can‚Äôt deliver it to the door which is 5 steps away from the mailbox. In addition, I have to wait 5 days for them to look into it and get someone to come to get it out.. Horrible."
"Complete lack of efficiency.
A package to be sent from Vancouver to a Southern Gulf Island. Arrived at Richmond facility on December 23rd. Departed Richmond facility to Victoria on January 21. Why? My theory, a backwards system - packages/mail arrives, gets thrown in a pile, pile is dealt with daily but packages/mail at the bottom are not cycled through and remain at the bottom of the pile, new stuff gets thrown on the top. Canada Post get your act together! This is unacceptable."
"Sent a completed Ontario government form from Waubaushene Ontario by xpresspost with 2 day guaranteed delivery. The letter was time sensitive that is why I sent xpresspost. Took not 2 business days but 4 business days. Filed a complaint and nothing happened. Called them on Jan 22 2021 and was told that they suspended their delivery guarantee, this was not mentioned when I mailed the letter. Effectively told, tough luck. NEVER SHIP ANYTHING BY CANADAPOST OR THEIR SIDELICK PUROLATOR, i will never again."
"Same as everyone else here. Completely pissed off and fed up Canada Post and it's over entitled unionized employees. I used to be one of those employees but had to quite cause I could fit the ""don't care about quality work"" mentality that this organization runs on.
The world would be fully functional if Canada Post disappeared cause then shippers would have better, reliable shipping options.
Canada Post is a letter carrier and should get out of the parcel business because they just can't handle it."
"6 days for a small parcel from Vancouver to Kelowna (4 hour drive)
It would be quicker on a lame donkey walking backwards!!!"
"Horrible service, an item that was supposed to take 5-8 days ended up close to a month. They would not respond to any questions on where it was staying and the tracking number provided didn‚Äôt work. Walmart.ca was also completely useless as a seller that wouldn‚Äôt help me track the item they shipped via Canada post."
"I preordered a game on EB games and Canada post was supposed to deliver it. 1 day before the release it said my order has shipped and will be here the 21st (1 day late). I then waited all day anxiously for them I saw the mail truck, I check the mail nothing there. About 20 minutes later I get an email saying my order has shipped and will be here January 25. I don‚Äôt understand why it shipped twice and why the delivery date was ever January 21 when it will take until the 25."
"We've all given Canada Post years to get their package game together. They've constantly undelivered. The proof is in the delivery times. Look at the reviews for Canada Post. Look at the threads on Reddit and Facebook. DHL, FedEx, Amazon, Intelcom constantly perform better. Intelcom usually even takes a nice little picture and email it to you."
"December 1 st I sent a card to my aunt in Chilliwack b.c.,she still doesn‚Äôt have it and it‚Äôs now January 20 th.
Then I made an online purchase which should have been here January 6th. And I still don‚Äôt have it! It‚Äôs not because of Covid or Christmas! Prior to COVID, and in the summer, I was ordering medication and dog food from a vet in Calgary. The delivery was always late! They ask where you‚Äôd like the delivery placed, but NEVER put it there! Tired of Canada post! They‚Äôre totally useless for regular mail or as a courier service."
"CP seems to have stopped trying to attempt delivery for parcels. They just leave a notice instead even when you‚Äôre home all day. Best to avoid CP when online shopping, especially for larger items since you‚Äôll have to go to the post office yourself to collect them."
"Canada post is the absolute worst. They never deliver anything, they just leave a stupid notice card and force me to go pick it up. I hate canada post with a passion, and always try to have things shipped with literally ANY service but them. AVOID at all costs! I hope all of their employees catch covid-19 from me for forcing me to go into the store, when they EASILY could deliver something to my home. Morons!"
"this company must be closed, they lost my 2 passports and that cost me 250$ ,and now they lost an other parcel ,it's not the firste time, it's take to long to answer to the phone(40 min) and finally with no solution ,also they don't deliver my express parcels at time ,wasting time and money. very disappointed"
"Package dropped off at a Canada Post outlet @230pm, Jan.12, in La Crete AB.

I'm still waiting for my parcel. Canada Post is absolutely atrocious in every way. I live in Vancouver BC. There is no valid excuse, IMHO, for a package to take this long to travel to the neighboring province. Give me a break. I could have driven to Alberta and retrieved my parcel myself, at least 5 times already.

You guys suck. You want to collect the union wages and benefits but don't really want to work. In stark comparison, the USPS actually does amazing work despite the ridicule they also receive. 3 day priority mail means 3 days. Sometimes 2, and sometimes 4. They do pretty good, workers make a fraction of your overinflated wage and put out 5 times the volume within 1/3 of the time.

I'm ashamed of our postal service. It's pathetic. I was experiencing these same issues even before Covid. I can't acknowledge or hear that excuse. Sorry.

I can't get a simple parcel the size of a box of crayons from Alberta to British Columbia in less than week. Why the F*** NOT?"
"Coming today by the end of the day, oh wait, no it‚Äôs tomorrow! Hang on, we‚Äôre experiencing difficulties, please check later. W-T-F?!"
"2 weeks to get a small package from Courtice to Windsor Ontario that was sent XPRESSPOST!!! No tracking updates the entire time. It is inexcusable that they can take people's money for a service that they openly advertise but refuse to honour. Their zero accountability, arrogance and complete indifference is astounding. Their ""customer service"" call centre is an absolute joke, the rudeness and arrogance of the supervisors is beyond belief. We desperately need a reliable privately run option in this country....kudos to Amazon for setting up their own delivery system that completely bypasses these incompetents!"
I spent 8+ hours on the phone with TELUS because their system for addresses goes through the Canada Post Auto Complete system and so I Can't use my billing address because it's not in the Canada post system. I am hopeful that soon enough Canada Post will go bankrupt and we can finally be rid of the terrible system completely.
"Send an international package value of $499 on September 29th by air and they told me that the package will be delivered 3-4 weeks, on October 3rd the package reached the customs on Defraa, Germany and since then I opened a ticket and called them so many times and same answer all the time, we‚Äôre are waiting for their response, today I received an email that my package was lost or stolen and they will refund me $100 general insurance , by the way when I sent the package they didn‚Äôt even let me know about the options for the insurance in case that the package will get lost. So disappointed with canada post, I cannot give them 0 because if I could I will, they don‚Äôt even deserve 1 . Do not even try to send international package with them."
There is never any useful info---take a look at their competitors--ALL ARE SUPERIOR
"At Nov 23, I sent my package from Canada Post to the government in AB Edmonton. I paid for express shipping and signature required! By that time, it shown the estimate delivery date is Nov 26 is latest. And then on the 27 Nov, I tracked online to make sure my package was delivered but no it was shown 'In transit'. However, on the website it said that due to the holiday and high parcels amount, the package could be arrived later than expect. I understood for that and wait... After 2 weeks I called them the 1st time and they gave me an email and e-ticket for waiting. After that another week, I called 2nd and they said that they will give an agent to discover my package! then because of holiday... The 4 Jan I called the 3rd time and they said that they have no update and gave me a significant label on their computer. Then the agent called me and he told me that my package is in no where and I asked for the solution and they did not give any answer!!! Then I called them 4th tine the following week to state the whole THING again and they freaking told me to call the government to make sure that my package hadn't arrived yet. it is a ridiculous excused they made! with a whole lot of case sent by paper work if it has not been operated, they won't showed any application number or anything to prove! Terrible service and problem solving!!! NO MORE CANADA POST"
"Trash service. Please don‚Äôt waste your time, pay the extra 5 or 10 dollars for the other delivery service."
"I would give 0 stars if I could for canada post, their delivery system is absolutely atrocious."
"This company is just a massive FRAUD !! Day in and day out they will sell you a service they know they cannot provide ,but they will lie to your face with a smile ,and take your money . It‚Äôs really just a collection of some of Canada ‚Äòs most incompetent people , led by clearly ,poor incompetent management ,that probably couldn‚Äôt run a lemonade stand as efficiently as the kid next door , You should all be fired , or re trained to do your job if deemed competent ! It‚Äôs amazing that people can go to space and return safely , but these fools can‚Äôt move a package one province over ,in the four days as quoted , we are now going on 15 days just pathetic !! They constantly use COVID as an excuse , well the whole world is dealing with this horrible virus ,and if every other company in this world had a response as bad as these fools we‚Äôd all be in peril !! . I have ordered 16 packages since Nov 25 with only 2 making the delivery standard every other one 1 to 3 weeks late !! This moving and processing of mail is not rocket science , but clearly everyone at C.P. could use a little tune up or refreshener course on what the objective is move the f****n mail in a reasonable time"
"Super efficient shipping from Canada to Australia, as it took less than a week. Pretty good considering current global delivery delays."
My package was crazy late and then when I finally contacted Canada Post they actually updated the website and delivered my package. Terrible service and terrible delivery timing. Worst experience ever. Avoid at every cost.
"Very bad ill never send anything with Canada post dont deserve our business i wasted my money sending parcels with them the customer service dont even pay attention what you tell them she shipped my parcels with ships without listening to my reply which was with air ,my Christmas gifts to my siblings is going to reach in Easter if they will be delivered, first and last experience with them ill never use Canada post again"
"Send a package from Ontario to Quebec by Xpost Canada Post service with GUARANTEED 3 DAY DELIVERY. It's been over two weeks and it's still not delivered. Call Canada Post asking what's going on and the guy gave me Covid excuse. I would be OK with it if not the fact that it was a guaranteed 3 day service which I paid for. Next time - delivery service that delivers on promises.
READING ALL THE REVIEWS HERE I REALIZE THAT CANADA POST DOES NOT GIVE A S*** ABOUT OUR REVIEWS OR SERVICE THEY TRYING TO PROVIDE."
Absolutely horrible!!!!
"Says ""delivered"" but I received nothing. Anyone else experienced the same thing as me? Contacted customer service and the solution they gave me was to check with other family members...AND yes I did check with my parents, my two budgerigars, and my grandma's ghost as well. Believe they DELIVERED OXYGEN"
"I feel everyone‚Äôs pain who posted here. Canada post needs to be shut down if it can‚Äôt adapt to the times. I placed an order with American Eagle and the product shipped from Allentown, Pennsylvania to Mississauga (crossing an international border) in two days. It then sat that a Canada post processing facility in Mississauga for over nine days!
My only wish is at one of our national networks would bring this to the light in their 24-hour news broadcasts.
Incompetence at its best!"
"WARNING! ABOUT CANADA POST
I ORDERED CLOTHING LAST YEAR AT A COST OF $400 FROM THE UK. I NEVER RECEIVED IT. ON NOV 10th CANADA CUSTOMS SAYS MY PARCEL HAS BEEN LOST OR STOLEN. SO I PLACED A SECOND ORDER DEC 29th. IT NEVER ARRIVED. ON JAN 8th I CONTACTED CANADA POST TO ASK WHY MY PARCEL DID NOT ARRIVE ON THE DATE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO. THEIR REPLY WAS ""SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR PARCEL HAS BEEN LOST OR STOLEN"". THIS TIME IT WAS LOST NOT BY CUSTOMS, BUT THE WELLAND SORTING FACILITY OR THE POSTAL WORKER DELIVERED IT TO THE WRONG HOUSE."
"Don't like and use Canada post anymore and forever. Lousy and arrant service. Use ups and other carrier services instead. Redirect all my banks, bills and statements electronically to my mailbox, super fast and free.

Canada post should be completely privatized. So the workers know what work is all about. Life is too good for them so why should they care about other people. Shame!"
This ‚Äòcrown corporation‚Äô which receives federally money to waste on exceptionally poor service continues to astound me. Maybe all federal money should stop and this company will finally have to learn how to manage itself and provide an adequate service like ups or fedex. How a package can spend 5-6 days in the Richmond sorting centre???
"Used to prefer Canada Post with local pickup at the drug store on weekends. Reliable standards. Good prices.

Lately it‚Äôs the worst. Latest package picked up in Toronto on a Tuesday for expedited shipment to Fredericton. Sat at the depot for three days before arriving in Calgary on Saturday. FYI, Calgary is 3,400 km in the wrong direction. Arrived in Montreal on Wednesday, Seven days after shipping. Still sitting there on Friday night at 10:00 pm (nine days) yet tracking says expected delivery by end of day today. Second time this has happened recently."
"I've never had such terrible postal service in my life! I live on a main road, in plain sight, clearly numbered, and they can't seem to get a package to my door. Customer service is no help. I've had Amazon remove Canada post as an option for delivery because they keep having to refund my money. I thought USPS was bad but they're a joy compared to this!"
"Never attempt delivery, just leave a card without even knocking. Made several complaints, doesn't make a difference."
"Honestly. 5 days to ship expedited between 2 cities an hour and a half drive apart. Are you kidding me? UPS and Amazon Logistics would have been next day in the morning. It‚Äôs gotten so bad myself and numerous people I know, will not make online purchases from any website that only ships with Canada Post. It‚Äôs that bad. Seriously people, if you care about your shipment, use someone else."
"The worst postal service I have ever had to use, when the government gets involved in anything it turns to crap. Look at the CBC. Choose UPS."
"I have 8 packages. None of them arrive. I always see that ""We‚Äôre delivering heavy holiday parcel volumes while putting safety first."" on Canada post Website, but i see they deliver flyers every day on time. If there are heavy holiday parcel volumes they are facing, at least they will deliver something every day, instead of flyers."
I get terrified every time my shipment is getting delivered by Canada Post. The bar is so low for Canada Post I'm relieved when my stuff gets delivered safely let alone on time.
Canada post is the worst company üò°üò°üò° my sister send a package from Mississauga to Vancouver on November 26 untill now January 14 2021 I didn‚Äôt get my 2boxes packages that is very important what is inside the boxes . When I track the number it‚Äôs say they left a notice card in my building but I don‚Äôt see any notice card then I check again the tacking number it‚Äôs say it‚Äôs sent to the sender all bulshit. All bulshit it‚Äôs all lie what I am hearing .there is a lots of lie that I can put in here . So frustrating..... Canada post is sucks sucks sucks . People are working in Canada post are sucks
"Canada Post is literally THE WORST choice for shipping anything. Everytime i order something online, it takes a minimum of a month to receive it, even when the item comes from Ontario.

Packages ALWAYS get lost and takes weeks for them to find it. This company is a f***ing sick joke and deserves to be shut the f*** down.

There are so many other companies that can get you your parcel in 2 days or less, why would anyone choose Canada Posts‚Äô 1990‚Äôs shipment system?

F*** you,
Canada Post"
"Canada Post needs to update their tracking system. The system software seems to have been written when there was actually Post Offices. Now delivery notices are shown as being delivered and are actually delivered a day later, the parcel being tracked is shown being in Post Office for pick up, when in fact it is at a postal station and is not delivered to a sub-post office for pick up until a day or so later. Bottom line Canada Post should buy into Amazon's tracking system and have a system which is in real time and actually works."
Iam so sick of Canada Post it seems almost ever package i‚Äôve ordered my packages seem to move fine until they reach Canada Post and i will get one last tracking scan and it says reached destination hub and thats it no more movement or tracking updates i have a total of 4 packages that have ended this way. The only explanation i can get from Canada Post is that Covid is the reason and iam sick of hearing that Canada Post was a horrible shipping company before Covid. In my opinion when Covid changed everything it exposed just how unbelievably incompetent Canada Post is.
"Service absolutely sucks and has for as long as I can remember, can't use covid as an excuse. Typical unionized worker services
Come on already Canada üá®üá¶"
"Horrible Service Horrible Co
I will never use Canada Post again . I have a parcel from Calgary to Victoria by Xpress post it‚Äôs not delivered from 10 days .I am calling every day . They are not doing any thing. There chat service is a joke. They are charging customer money but providing very poor service.I have another international registered letter lost by Canada Post with my legal docs it‚Äôs been lost from 2 months . Canada post still unable to help me. I have a very bad experience with Canada post. I will never use them again. I have left so many messages with the supervisor they do not even to care to call back their customers.

Note to that after calling every day to Canada Post my xpress parcel that was dropped at Canada post on Jan 3rd at Calgary was delivered finally on January 22nd at Victoria"
"Horrible service. I have shipped the same parcel with Purolator before and it got delivered in 2 days. This time I decided to try Canada Post but not only it took over 2 weeks, they returned it ( has to pay for the return too ) as they stated the deliver address was wrong. This is a lie, I ship goods there all the time. Bottom line. They are useless. Use another company, save your waste of money and time."
Terrible customer service Their tracking system is screwed up - tell you things are in transit or delivered but in reality they have not moved for days and are not delivered. Their virtual assistant is less than a useless waste of time and will not connect you to a live agent - you have to ‚ÄúTry back later.‚Äù Meanwhile you have no clue if you will or won‚Äôt get what you ordered and paid for. Used to be reliable - now it is the worst.
"This company is awful. They are very slow at delivering packages, the customer support is super unhelpful and just lie to you whenever they please. I have an item that I shipped back on Dec.24th 2020, the expected delivery date is Jan.5th 2021, here we are at Jan.13th and there has been no updates on the tracking in 2 weeks. I called in to open a service ticket to rush things along a bit and they told me you can not open a service ticket until 1 business day after the expected delivery date... I told them it is now 8 days past and they replied that it is not true and the delivery date it today so I need to wait another day. Meanwhile I told them I have photo evidence of the original expected delivery date and they just keep replying no, no ,no ,no. I also have written confirmation of this since the buyer messaged me 2 days after the expected delivery. Canada post is straight lying to me and saying the original delivery date it today, the representative I was talking to about this decided to just disconnect from the chat instead of resolving this issue and now when I try to connect it keeps saying busy..... im shocked at how much these people do not care about their customers or their packages. I honestly might never use Canada Post again. I also took screen captures of the conversation with the employee lying to me as evidence."
they will not respect the delivery standard and they will loose package they even put a message on there phone number to tell you to respect canada post employee because they know they f up there custumer services are useless and the employees dont know nothing privatise Canada post because this company is clearly a joke
Canada Post very bad. you change delivery anytime according to your choice. They use only one excuse due to Covid its late and always lie.
the worst company so far
"I have an important parcel that has been in process since Jan 7 and I should leave Canada on Jan 12, however, thanks to Canada Post, I cannot make it on time! It says that the delivery standard is today and it probably sucks when I saw ""processing error"", how freaking on earth could you guys have errors during these sensitive days? Everyone's packages are essential and being delayed is not what we expected! Especially when I use express post service as you say on the website ""the parcel will arrive in 2 days business""."
"ordered coins on Nov.6/2020 from abroad as I collect them. they arrived in Canada this past month now I was told Today Jan.11/2021: Item on hold at a secure facility; contact Customer ServiceScarborough, ON ...apparently they damaged the box and all the coins were damaged also and now it was DESTROYED!...W-T-F-??...they cannot do anything about it they told me and they are not liable also...."
"Absolutely TERRIBLE, I was supposed to get my package last week, it was ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù still have yet to get it. Calling them is a waste of time because they do nothing. Found out my package I was receiving was CANCELLED. AND THEY DIDNT TELL ME. What a waste of time."
"Just ridiculous. They need to do away with their tracking system and simply stop giving out false dates. How can item go from being 'delivered today, with the delivery carrier' to 'still calculating' for 3 weeks? It doesn't make sense. If the package was with the mail person that day, where did it go for the next few weeks?
I ordered some Xmas gifts in November in anticipation of the rush and a few items have still not arrived. I wish all stores would drop Canada Post as their delivery provider of choice."
"Best thing I ever did was tell Amazon that I did not want packages delivered by Canada Post...suggest everyone do the same to send a message...itbwas a quick and easy phone call.

I am currently waiting on a package that was originally intended to be delivered 4 days ago. It is in Montreal and basically has taken 5 days to travel from one side of Montreal to the other. At this rate it should be in Toronto in about 5 months.

Here is the thing, I understand that it takes time for items to travel in the mail, but if you are going to have a tracking system, make sure it is accurate. Do not say something will be delivered on day X and then provide no update when it doesn't arrive and keep pushing the arrival date back to dates that will be missed. I think just having an accurate tracking system would improve how people view this company 100%."
"I first used Canada Post 15 years ago, for the first 10 years they wouldn‚Äôt delivery to my door because it was in a cul-de-sac (before the community boxes) until I moved. Then I took a break and came back to ... whatever this ‚Äúcompany‚Äù is. They are so incompetent all the way down, they can‚Äôt give you a legit expected delivery date because it‚Äôs all automated to give you false hope. I pay $20 every time for express and it takes 2 weeks to get from BC to Alberta (consistently, not just once), how about since you know you can‚Äôt make those deadlines you lied about, you change the cost to reflect the service.. FREE. Get your act together, what an embarrassment to Canada!"
If I could get zero stars I would. Husband waited on a parcel that came from someone from the US and It sat at border after authorization for a long time. He called Canada Post and they said that they weren‚Äôt prioritizing US parcels. It took three months to receive the item. Waiting on our Koala crate for our daughter for over a month now and again it‚Äôs sitting at the border after authorization. Wish we could choose which mail carrier to use but no such luck.
"Message for Trustpilot- add negative stars.
-5 stars for Canada Post"
"I live in a small town (150 km from Winnipeg) - Canada Post website tells me that my item departed Winnipeg on the 6-th of January, YET - it is expected to be delivered on the 12-th of January. SERIOUSLY???? If they have a hard time handling the volume (which is understandable), hire extra help, work through the weekends. This seems to be a logical solution for any private company, but not for this crown corporation - way overpaid and way under-delivering (in every sense)."
"so i had no idea that we can no longer take a package to the post office to get it delivered to another country. that changed in december i guess. so after lugging the package up to the post office, i was told to do the customs form on line. i had to take the package home and attempt the on line form. after three hours i gave up. now i have package for a friend in portugal that is wrapped and ready to go and no way of getting it there. canada post has to re-think this. i filled the form out at least 5 times and every time it said there was something wrong, but not indicating what the problem was. it totally sucks. what are you supposed to do? there is NO alternative so, i guess my friend will not get the gift. i always used to brag about canada post. that will no longer be the case."
"they wont attempt to buzz on apartment or notify client if they have delivery that wont fit in mailbox. THATS THEIR POLICY DURING COVID WTH!!
Having people leave their home to pickup their package is not better! please shut down your lazy mess!!

YOU DONT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR"
"I paid for a package to go from Calgary to Victoria. I sent it December 29, just tracked it and now it says arriving January 12. Everyday I track it , it says the next day but on that day it says next day again. So I have no idea when it will arrive. I have perishables in the package that obviously will be bad by now. I don‚Äôt understand how they are backed up. Christmas is OVER . No other service has screwed up like this FedEx-UPS -TNT they
Manage to get parcels out. Why not Canada post? I paid double the amount to have it in 2 days vs 5-7 business days and it‚Äôs going on 3 weeks . I had ordered a package from Turkey Dec 24 and with all the holidays in there received it within8 days. DID CANADA POST LOSE MY PARCEL ?????? And they are covering it up????? I WANT MY
MONEY BACK"
It‚Äôs a joke they tell you it will arrive on a certain day you wait around all day for that delivery and it does not come. Called my local Canada post/drugstore to find out it‚Äôs not even in Ottawa yet... and guess what they don‚Äôt work weekends must be nice. Why take on delivery of parcels if you suck at it and you don‚Äôt work weekends. Amazon is way better. Learn from them that‚Äôs why relics need to go.
"I understand the covid issue so the shipping will be slower than usual and also I'm sending it to Asia country, so I sent my package early on December 3rd. The package is for my mom‚Äôs birthday on January 1st, and they told me the package will arrive at January 3rd which is okay, however, due to their mistake the package went to Vancouver and then sent back to me to Toronto, which is unacceptable! I called the online services to solve the problem, they did not apologize to me, moreover they said their is nothing they can do and hang up on me! They resent my package on December 17 but now is still in Mississauga transit and it‚Äôs been there for 3 weeks already. I'm really mad, definitely not choose Canada post in the future!!! My mom‚Äôs birthday already passes and she is still waiting for her gift. Turn out I have to let her wait 2-3 months."
"Expedited Parcel that took over a month to get with 4 separate will be delivered on..... I work graveyard shifts so I have to stay awake for this bullshi't. Only to have them tell me once again wont be delivered till Monday but when I just checked it again at 4 am Saturday ""delivered"". Im sorry who the fck signed for the package left outside all fck'ing day? Same with ever heard of a doorbell or knocking you lazy fcks. If I showed half of this incompetence in my job I would be fired no questions asked but this is their whole company."
I sent a card out from Camrose Ab 2 weeks before Christmas 4 weeks later it has not yet arrived in Calgary. Also waitinf for 2 cards from Thunder Bay On sent out 3 weeks ago. I understand covid but this is not excusable. Rating is a neg if there was an option.
"I sent a package from Ottawa to Toronto,sent on the 27th of December,paid for expedited shipping,it arrived at the destination 10 days later. I get it's Christmas but why take my money for express shipping if you can't do it.. it was for my business and now I'm on hold working because of CANADA POST,, I will NEVER SEND A PACKAGE WITH CANADA POST AGAIN,. FedEx Canpar anyone else.."
Deserve a minus 5 stars. My registered letter from the USA has been sitting in Vancouver from Dec 31st! what a joke!
SO SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIPPING COMPANY. WORST SERVICE EVER. NEVER DOING THERE JOB. ON A UNION AND STRIKE RIGHT LEFT AND CENTRE ARE PAID MORE THEN THEY SHOULD. RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. SLOWEST SHIPPING TIMES EVER. ALWAYS EXUSES. DISGUSTINGLY EXPENSIVE SHIPPING RATES. THEY LOOSE YOUR PACKAGE. THEY RETURN ITEMS BEFORE CALLING BUYER OR EVEN LEAVING A NOTICE. THEY DON'T KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR. THERE AWFUL- choose any other shipping company then this one.
"HONESTLY CANADA POST IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALSO HORRIBLE
FKN SO BAD, EXPEDITITED PARCEL, 5 DAYS THEY SAY HAHA, HASNT ARRIVED ITS BEEN 12 DAYSüòê"
"Stupid me could‚Äôve just drove to Edmonton to pick it up but noo, I decided to get the item sent to me by Canada post XPRESS! I ordered shoes from outside of the country ON CHRISTMAS DAY and I received it but one item from literally Edmonton to Calgary is taking forever! And it was sent to me before Christmas! I feel like crying because it‚Äôs my school book"
Over 4 weeks now from Calgary. Merry effn Christmas. What are we even paying for. This is what we get from unionized workers. What a joke.
"One star is to high.
One package shipped on Nov30, finally got an update, delivered Jan 05. only thing is nothing was delivered.
Second package shipped Dec 02, express, still has not arrived.
When they say at beginning of December to ship your holidays packages early to ENSURE that they arrive on time, then they FU*K it up. They've been pulling this same crap for years and now they using covid as an excuse."
"I was told my package would be delivered on January 3rd. Every day it‚Äôs supposed to be delivered, they push it back two more days. It has gone from the 3rd, to the 5th, to the 7th, to the 9th at this point. Being shipped from Vancouver to Victoria and it still hasn‚Äôt updated from being in Vancouver. This is getting ridiculous. Majorly unreliable service."
"Terrible delivery times. Paying extra for ""Expresspost"" seems to actually slow delivery times down. Delivery from 20 blocks away in downtown Toronto is slated to take 5 days. I could have crawled over and picked up the package quicker."
Ordered parcel from Best Buy and was to be delivered by Canada Post. Tracking information said the parcel would be delivered Jan 7 between 9:00am and 1:00pm. Stayed home on the 7th to be sure I received the parcel. Checked tracking this morning and it said the item was out for delivery at 8:55 am. At 10:00 I went out to find a delivery notice on my letterbox right next to the doorbell. The notice said to pick up my parcel the next day in town at the Pharmasave after 1:00pm. I have a rather loud doorbell so it was obviously not rang. Save your time and effort use a different carrier as Canada Post certainly doesn't know how to deliver a parcel.
"I've been using CanadaPost for years, by obligation. I've found that their overall service and delivery times have been deteriorating for years now. I've had to change to electronics invoices, because my invoices ( which are local courrier) never arrived within the appropriate MONTH. I have two packages actually undefinitely waiting for an updated delivery date... Which means I don't even know if they are coming in 2021.... Thoses packages were traveling from Vancouver to Montreal... And just seems lost...."
Package has been delayed twice now and is supposed to come on the 29th of December now they tell me I have to wait until the 12th for someone to contact me for two video games... worst company. Now its said it was to be delivered today and now apparently they have to verify the address deeming the item delayed. Fkn stupid fk this stupid company. Three delays
Had a parcel with expected delivery Jan 4th. Arrived in Winnipeg December 22nd and wasn't attempted to be delivered until Jan 5th. On Jan 6th they accidentaly shipped it to a different city. January 7th it got shipped back to the correct city and now my new expected delivery date is Jan 11th despite it having arrived in the correct city Dec 22... Customer service state there's nothing they can do and it can't be expedited even though it was their error.
"We had a letter containing a gift card stolen by a Canada Post employee during the holiday season. This is very disheartening and frustrating as Canada Post states they are 'sorry' it didn't arrive at the destination.
I have lost faith in the process and will resort to other means next time."
"I purchase a lot from amazon. Amazon uses Canada post to ship most of time. Last year, over 50% of my packages were delayed, or lost in transition. Each time I have to call Amazon for the replacement when the delivery time is due.

This situation turned bad to worse last month. All of my purchase in December are delayed or lost. All the tracking messages stated a consistent and exact same message:
""Delay in delivery due to external factors, WINNIPEG, MB CA"""
"Canada post is a joke. They were handed my package on dec 29 at 9:30 am in mississauga, they have yet to scan it. So it still shows a International tracking #, so canada post can't do anything. So more then likely won't see that. I have all so not been able to get in my mailbox since dec 22, I called them I was told 3 Business days, but he would put a Rush on it. We are now on jan 6 and still can't get in to mailbox. Canada post can't do anything. They should just be removed and let ups amd Purolator do delivers. Anyone gettomg a package by them are getting it on tome. Not waiting weeks later."
"Canada Post hides tracking information when it misdirects mail. When my package was reported to have been sent to an unexpected location and missed the standard date, the customer service person told me that they did not have any more information than I did on the web site, that it left Mississauga on the 24th. When I insisted to speak to the supervisor, she told me that it was last scanned in Ottawa on the 30th. So why can't I see that on the tracking website? Because Canada Post is run by imbeciles who hide evidence of misdirected mail. Pakistan, I kid you not, has a more reliable postal system, because they have employees who take their jobs seriously."
"This is me still waiting for my package to be delivered by Canada post, more than a month after paying for priority shipping. I still don't have a date for delivery yet. Last update Dec 7,2020, itemed shipped Dec 2,2020. I wish i could give a negative rating not even 1."
"Canada post does not deserve 1 star. Been waiting for 5 days for a package that is in my home town and ""out for delivery"" for these past 5 days and yet nothing has come in the mail can't even call customer service since it's all robots now. I can't slam the dislike on Canada post harder this is far from the only incident as well It also seems many people on this very site agree with me."
"Been 12 days since the package left the sender. Status seems to be stuck at ""sender has created a shipping label"", yet the tracking site still says ""expected delivery today"". I contacted a customer service rep and the ""help"" I recieved was absolutely useless; ""give us a few more days"". Like thanks a lot for that really great advice I never would've thought of that. I've been waiting for almost 2 weeks just for the package to SHIP. Super worried because it contains $100 worth of goods. I understand that the holidays are busy but this is unreasonable. I'd at least like to be updated on where the hell it is."
"Hi,

Second time writing a review. If I truly had the time I‚Äôd have at least 100 reviews I could write how many times canada post is so bad. But this one is hilariously bad hahah i gotta share. So I ordered something December 11th. Its holiday season I expect a delay. My package was coming from atlanta and it arrived in Canada December 21ist. It eventually made its way to Richmond, BC December 28th. The package is coming to Vancouver Bc which is a 15 minute drive. I waited all the way to January 2nd then i decided to call canada post and pick up the package. I went to the canada post and they told me my package was in transit and it would b delivered the day I went. I went home and waited and waited. It‚Äôs currently January 6th... The package has being in transit for 4 days... and its a 15 minute drive away. What am i supposed to do"
"Slowest joke of a service I've used so far. I am not a Canadian but had the unfortunate opportunity to use an online shop in Toronto while in NS. 20 days in and they just keep pushing it back further and further. Check out how the USPS operates, aim for that standard. Letting private companies whip you on every front is sad and embarrassing. I now cancel orders/return items if they're CP, end of story. I don't have a month to wait for each one. Amazon's delivery service on the other hand is lightning quick by comparison, hope they switch fully to that in fact. CP needs to learn a lesson."
"On Dec. 18 time sensitive documents were sent via Xpresspost for 1-2 days delivery to Winnipeg from Victoria. The cost was for Canada Post's priority service. The next day 'expected delivery' was going to be 4 days, Dec. 24. Then 'expected delivery ' was changed to Dec. 29, then Dec. 30. On Dec. 30 the 'expected delivery' became Jan. 4, a total of 17 calendar days. On Jan 4 delivery became Jan. 5. On Jan. 5 tracking showed an ""unexpected delay"" while a search was on for the package. Today is Jan. 6 and tracking shows expected delivery by end of day today. Maybe. We'll see. Parcel post moves faster most days. 20 calendar days for a premium priced priority delivery!!! How does Canada Post justify charging premium fees if they know they are incapable of fulfilling their agreement for timely delivery? Now I will use a private courier. Not Canada Post. And Not Purolator. Incompetence does not earn business."
"I don‚Äôt think I have ever had a parcel arrive when it‚Äôs expected. It costs me nearly $100 to send a small package to my boyfriend in Norway (which is robbery). The tracking never seems to be accurate, I don‚Äôt know why I bother looking. It‚Äôs tragic when my orders from Amazon are to be delivered by Canada post."
"The worst and most tribble experience that I ever had with a mailing services is with Canada Post.
The supervisor and agents are very rude and incapable to follow up. They hide behind their policies(if any policy exist at all). My father health became critical as the Canada Post lost our medicine package and no one is responsible even for refund.
Strongly recommend to use other curriers."
Super pissed off my tracking info said my package was out for delivery oct 9. and 'rerouted due to processing error' no updates and no delivery no package 3 MONTHS later.
If I could give minus stars I would. I've been waiting a month for some things and a item 5hr away took two weeks to get to williams lake but not to our place. Said the item was out for delivery but never received it. Says it was changed to a different address. What the hell!!! I understand that there's covid but no excuse for any of this. You still have a job to do just like everyone else.
The lady who delivered my package just today was just thrown it in front of my door. This is the second time she did that. We already complained about her behaviour but seems like she didn‚Äôt get her lesson or she is naturally RUDEüò°.
"When I see my packages shipped by Canada post, I cry. I'd give it negative stars if I could.
They never deliver my items to the 24/7 concierge at my building and claims that they have left a notice card for me to pick up. I get no notice card at all, and neither does the concierge who just sit in the lobby all the time. UPS, DHL amazon, you name it, they all deliver without a problem. My BF day purchases has yet to arrive in January from Canada post.
+it's impossible to reach customer service :)"
"Unfortunately the service is always HORRIBLE. Consumer service never has any answers for you, even the script before them, cant even follow it. Waiting time always above 30min. I hate it when online stores ship with post Canada. With in the city the package got lost. Delivery not on time.NEVER.
Thank god for Amazon. It sad because small business pay the biggest price since we are pushed to shop with amazon instead."
"Garbage in every single way. Im originally from Somalia. The delivery service in the most rural areas in Mogadishu, Somalia is 10-20 times better than this.

Drivers NEVER deliver parcels/packages to doors. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a call from them, they will INTENTIONALLY hand out half of your package, ONLY if you come downstairs, *if you‚Äôre very lucky*.

I saw the second package with my own eyes, with my name written on it 10-15 mins ago in the drivers mini van. He said he only has 1, and that I should go to Canada post tomorrow to pick it up. 0 stars.

Worthless, unworthy, disloyal, uneducated, impatient, unprofessional, lazy, painful, and stressful are just a few words that come to mind to describe Canada post. I‚Äôve been unfortunately enough to deal with them for 13-14 years now. They‚Äôve only been getting worse."
"If I could give Canada Post a lower rating I would. I am constantly waiting for packages that are sent to me. They are always sorted at the postal outlet in Richmond, BC. Canada Post will send me a message saying that the parcel will be delivered on a certain date but it never is delivered. Then they will revise that date and when the revised date comes up, the parcel still is not delivered. You cannot get any help from the people at Canada Post. Canada Post should have been privatized years ago. I worked for Canada Post years ago and I have seen how lazy the workers are. Because the workers are union, they cannot be fired. Customers continually pay more and more for shipping and the service gets worse. The only workers that I believe should be praised are the outside workers who deliver the mail."
"Horrible and absolutely terrible company with the name CANADA post.
You should change the name DELAY POST.

Since I ordered something and tracked my order, I saw they came with Canada Post, I immediately knew, they would be late with some excuses."
"Consistently getting ""attempted delivery, card was left"" with any packages i get from amazon that canada post delivers. Each time the supposed ""attempted delivery"" took place, there have been numerous people at the residence including myself and never a knock or doorbell. majority of the time the doorknocker slip wasnt even left to tell me where or whats going on. I've had to call, wait on hold for extended periods of time, then wait days longer to have to go pick up my packages myself that i have already paid for to be delivered to my house. at this rate canada post is costing me time and money for every package it ""ghost delivers"" to my residence. A quick google search shows this shadiness has been a problem with them for years, and nothing has changed. Its obvious they dont want to deliver packages, so why dont they outsource parcel delivery to a competent company that will value its customers"
straight dog shxt never again
Horrible company run by incompetent people. They had over 9 months to get ready for the xmas rush knowing full well what covid was doing. They fail on every level. Over 35 days waiting for a parcel from across my city. This needs to be shutdown. Never going to buy a product from anyone that uses Canada Post
"Absolutely ridiculous! Not only has my parcel been delayed until further notice, their garbage virtual assistant won‚Äôt connect me to a real person either. I really love RISE.ca products but not worth this headache, never ordering from RISE, or any vendor that uses Canada post"
"Canada Post doesn‚Äôt deserve 1 star. Order something through any other carrier and it will come faster. Blaming delays on covid all during 2020 and still couldn‚Äôt get it together before the busy season. Sorters work 2m apart from each other in the facilities anyway. They pulled the same thing in 2019 when there was no covid at all. Also had almost a year to prepare for this and just told everyone to Buy/ship in October... Completely tone deaf to the pandemic and THEY WERE NEVER EVEN SHUT DOWN. I dont think taxpayers should be on the hook for this garbage service, zero accountability. It happens time and time again."
I don‚Äôt even want to leave the 1 star. Canada post needs to honestly just shut their business down it‚Äôs awful and only getting worse! Why give a delivery date if you never ever deliver on time?! Like NEVER! It doesn‚Äôt matter where you order from never ever on time! I had to threaten Amazon and let them know I will pull my prime membership if they send anymore of my parcels through Canada post. There has never in my life been a time when Canada post has actually delivered a item on or before the expected delivery and it‚Äôs never 1 or 2 days late always a whole week and guess where it‚Äôs always sitting for a whole week? Somewhere in Mississauga. Get your crap together Canada post and don‚Äôt blame COVID either you guys were terrible long before the pandemic
"Terrible service, they said that they make an attempt to deliver my package but there is not footage in my cameras.

Liars."
"Canada post is a joke. The ""covid"" blanket excuse isn't going to cut it. I run a small business and im getting my ears full of ""wheres my stuff? And then customers posting in groups asking if mtmy company is a scam because canada post is completely useless and the dates for deliver are 2+ weeks delayed with no tracking updates. Are they under-staffing themselves to line their pockets with all the parcel cash and holing they will just get caught up eventually? They sure as hell won't hire more people to help with the increased workload. What a $#@# company the Ceo should resign. I wouldnt want them managing a mcdonalds"
"When you are the country's brand name courier and you are so far behind all your other competitors, I don't understand what Canada Post's management is doing... All the large stores have stopped using Canada Post to avoid customer complaints now, i.e. Amazon, Costco, Walmart. I ordered from each one of these shops, everything delivered within a week, some even 3 days during December.

I just had an order from Amazon, shipped by Purolator, ordered and received within a week. So glad Amazon has given up on Canada Post."
"What a waste, only information provided is "" Item delayed ‚Äî stay tuned for updates "" this was 15 days ago. Absolute bullocks. I could bike to and from where The package was sent from faster than it is taking to be delivered."
"I have 3 packages coming from Winnipeg to Vancouver Island ,expedited with tracking ,one has made it to Richmond B.C and sat for a fu#**n month , the other still in Winnipeg 28 days ,and the last in ‚Äúin transit ‚Äú Just a complete failure from top to bottom ! Maybe the head person at Canada Post ,we won‚Äôt mention thier name ,should take part of that apparent $500,000 a year salary ,and go get an education ,on how to move something from one place to another ! The local McDonalds drive through manager surely would do a better job ,I‚Äôm sure that he or she would understand that when you get busy you have to work ,first off !! Also that the deal is not done once they take your money ,they still have to get the food from the grill ,to the window ,and into your possession in a reasonable time , could you imagine waiting an hour to 3-4 days for your burger , that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd get with C.P. Management ,now if Canada Post was a hockey team you owned you‚Äôd see they are a horrible disgrace , so you‚Äôd fire the manager , or coach , players ,or all above ,you guys SUCK !!"
"Got an email from Canada Post that my package has been delivered at 2.31 pm. I live on a condo building, there is security personnel at the front desk. I went downstairs at 3.52 pm same day to retrieve tha package from my letter box, and there was none. No note was left by Canada Post directing me to pick up the package at a Post Office. No key was left in my letter box to access the package in Canada Post lock box. No one held responsible. The 3 sterling silver chains I purchased as Christmas present for my grandkids are nowhere to be found."
"I mailed a parcel to the US on Dec. 16th with tracking, from Hamilton ON. It wasn't scanned in Mississauga until the 23rd. !!! How inefficient is that? Estimated delivery initially to LA was 22nd. Then it was rescheduled for delivery on the 26th...then rescheduled for the 29th. Today is the 29th and it shows ""in transit"".....still not delivered and my customer is so angry. It was still in Canada on the 24th. I believe all the delay was in Canada. What an inefficient unreliable service. I can hardly wait for the border to reopen. I would always take my parcels into NY state and mail them from there. Coast to coast in the US is 3 days...count on it with priority mail. USPS is so much more reliable. BUT wait...there's more. Sent a parcel to Vancouver from Hamilton Xpresspost and it took 10 days !!!! Unbelievable. And it isn't going to change 'cause they don't give a s***."
There was an issue with the address although the sender assured it was written correctly. Called customer server to figure out the issue and avoid the item being returned to sender. Was given no options just told to suck it up even though they still had my package in their possession. Then was promptly hung up on when I asked to speak to a supervisor to possibly save my package. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with in my life.
None of my orders came on time for Christmas even though I ordered well in advance (late November). One of my items sat in one of their facilities for over two weeks with zero movement. All that the customer service reps do is send you in a circle with no new information or help. Completely useless company.
"Canada Post is GARBAGE. I ordered a PC case from bestbuy and Canada Post showed me delivered today at 11:22 AM and I knew my package was coming soon so I was at the window waiting , I saw the deliveryman put letters and packages of other people around the neighborhood but nothing at my house! Besides that, the item said ""Do not safe drop"" and it's really pissing me off now because literally the same thing happened last year when I ordered a laptop. I DON'T WANT A CLAIM OR REFUND that PC case was on boxing day sale at an unbelievable price and now it's out of stock, stop screwing other people's holidays! I've been waiting for the PC case forever and now they've just launched a ticket, like I give a sh** of your investigation, why do you even deliver packages if you just don't wanna give our items to us.

Even if you have to spend 100$ extra for delivery via other options, do it and avoid Canada Post, trust me it'll save you time and a lot of headaches."
Canada post knew this virus wasn't going away anytime soon plus they knew there was going to be a huge surge in online shopping and what did they do about it ? NOTHING. Typical government run organization. USELESS. I've been waiting over a month for 3 packages. If I could have had them shipped by courier I would. I would even pay extra to avoid Canada post. A one star rating is way too high for these clowns.
I am very dissapointed with Post Office Mississauga. Package was never deliver at my from door (the security system didn't alarm that anyone was at the door at that time) the post office said that the package was delivered.I didn't get any notification that day of delivery but few days later. There was a package with Christmas gifts. I am not satisfied with to the investigation either saying that the package was stolen from my front door. Which is wrong. Ok think the package was deliver to the wrong address.
I try to be understanding with Covid and the Christmas season but the service standard despite that is totally unacceptable. Packages aren't being scanned so you can't see where they are but yet the delivery date keeps getting bumped! What are they doing to catch up on the volume? At least provide the public some type of explanation and some service standards they can rely on. I would boycott CP totally at this point if possible and use a reliable service.
"Been waiting on a package with materials for a project im working on for a customer. Shipped december 3rd, and has been sitting in missisauga since the 11th.. it is now the 31st. At this point i dont know if i'll ever recieve my package. They have one job: deliver mail. and they cant even manage to do that. Oh i also paid $60 usd for expedited shipping. Seriously canada post, just give up. This is laughable that youre an actual business in 2020 conducting operating this way. Children could design a more efficient shipping service."
I have been waiting for a package since the 17th. It is currently the 30th aka the day it was supposed to arrive. It didn't. I just found out that Canada Post isn't working New Years Eve with no warning. I am so pissed like this is absolute nonsense.
"It‚Äôs a fuming shame that they don‚Äôt for-warn Canadians they weren‚Äôt planning on working all Christmas season.

I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered anything had I known my product would be on hold in Richmond since the 18th of December. It is now the 30th, and while was certain I wouldn‚Äôt have received my package on Christmas; what I didn‚Äôt account for was they also weren‚Äôt planning on working on New Year‚Äôs Eve, they didn‚Äôt state it publicly until the day before.

I get that they need a break, but letting Canadians know ahead of time would save us all a lot of time, backorders on both our ends and headaches. I‚Äôd have planned to not shop at all through CP had I known they weren‚Äôt planning on working on both Christmas and New Years, especially during a pandemic where their services are more necessary than ever, and they leave us hanging like this with late information and little forewarnings of their intentions for their schedule this season."
"I had to select a one, because 'F' was not available. I have a package going to Granby that was supposed to be there Dec23. It is now the 30th and its been sitting the same place all this time. It says 'in transit' and 'item processed in Montreal'.
Say, what?? To say 'in transit' implies movement.
I paid a LOT for shipping...I am giving the sending company a copy of this and demanding a refund for the expedited shipping. Even via sled dog would have been faster."
"I‚Äôve had issues with Canada Post on multiple occasions. In two occasions they deliver to the wrong address (and to the same wrong one!). Costumer service tells me they can see on their side that the address is correct, but it‚Äôs only on their system so I can‚Äôt see it. And when I go on the site it says it was delivered to a completely different CITY! So I really don‚Äôt understand. The second time around after being on the phone for an hour they said they would open a ticket to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù the issue within 3 business days. After those three days if they don‚Äôt send it back to you they will take ZERO responsibility and tell you to contact the sender. By the time they look into the issue and go back to search for the package of course is going to be gone!"
"I ordered a package and it was estimated to come in on December 18, but it got delayed to the 31st. But its been in Edmonton for over a week now and before that it was in Missisauga for 2 weeks, I want to know why are you guys slowing down the shipping speed, i know because of covid, but i ordered a package in summer and it came in like 3 days, this is not normal."
"Canada Post is an absolute disgrace to the transportation industry in Canada, which is pretty terrible already. Time for the government to scrap this over expensive to tax payers absolutely pathetic excuse of a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. Get out and let the private sector handle transportation. They actually have a clue how to move packages 700 kms in under thirty days."
Do not ship any parcels to Calgary via Canada Post! They will steal it and due to obvious poor supervisors (or maybe they are in on it) nothing and I mean NOTHING will be done! We sent our daughter 3 parcels within the past 6 months and 2 have gone missing after they reach Calgary. In the future we will not be using Canada Post Services!
"If im ordering online, and I see Canada post is delivering, I cancel the order. I ordered a very expensive package from hudson bay, and it was to be delivery the following friday. Well that day came, no package. I checked the delivery time the next day, and it changed from that Friday, to the following Tuesday. Tuesday came, no package, now it's been two weeks since that Tuesday, and theres still no estimated time of delivery. Meanwhile, I ordered two different packages from different companys, with different delivery services, and both showed up within two days, on a sunday, before noon. It's been a total of three weeks since I ordered from hudson bay, and I still have nothing. This has completely tarnished hudsons bay rep for me, as a company that has been around for a very long time, they should be able to keep up with the forever free changing market, and throw canada post as their delivery service, in the garbage, where Canada Post belongs. Please, big company's, do not use canada post, as it is driving customers away"
"Lazy and useless! Gave one star because there is no option for a negative amount. Ordered printer ink Dec 6th 2020. Due to covid and other 'excuses' the delivery date was changed 3 times. Final delivery date given was Dec 29th by end of day. At 1:50pm on the 29th, myself and my wife were standing in the entrance to our home and watched as a Canada 'we do not care or deliver' van pulled in front of our house, driver got out with a parcel in his hands, took two steps towards the rear of the van, turned around got back in and drove away! Could not believe what we witnessed. The sidewalk and driveway were completely snow free, (I took photo's to prove it right after he drove away because I wondered if he might use that as an excuse) some packed snow on the road, he could obviously see how clear our (over size) driveway etc was as he drove towards it. 100% no excuse for the non delivery. Our front door is a few seconds from where he parked, he was even already out of the vehicle. This makes zero sense! We complained online to C.P. with an explanation of what we witnessed and all we were told is the parcel is ready for pick up at our local post office. No apology, no 'we will talk to the delivery person', no concern of any kind, seriously doubt that they even read our complaint. They basically just dismissed our concerns, they are absolutely ignorant and useless from the top down. It is bad enough that it took over 3 weeks for a parcel to come from B.C. to AB. but to not even bother walking to our door once leaving the vehicle is pathetic! With all of the people looking for work right now, you would think this employee would be grateful for having a job and if not, then C.P. should replace him."
"Canada post! Stop taking on packages when you can‚Äôt even handle the ones you have. I think you need to take a break and do some catch up! Yikes. This is the worst postal service in Canada by far. I‚Äôm still waiting on on Christmas items that were supposed to be here Dec 15th. I want to order my daughter something off amazon for her 3rd birthday, but I‚Äôm afraid that you will pick up the package and will disappoint her a second time. üòí"
"Time to go automated and electric. Humans aren't doing it.
Canada Post is obviously understaffed or overpaid. Let's get robots to do this work much more efficiently. I have 4 items ordered in early November, all from within Canada, none have arrived. I have items to send out, but I think I'll go through a courier. Probably less expensive and less stressful."
"I cringe every time I see an order is being delivered by Canada Post. Ordered items on Amazon arrive within a couple to a few days with any other carrier. With Canada Post - it‚Äôs a given that there will be issues. Twice before I ordered large ticket items with insurance. A dehumidifier and a portable air conditioner. In both cases the tracking showed arriving at the Mississauga sorting centre and then stayed there forever. Magically, they don‚Äôt know what happened to the items and I needed to use the insurance to get my money back. Last month, my son ordered a Bluetooth microphone. Again, tracking shows it got stuck in Mississauga sorting centre for weeks. After a complaint to Best Buy, it arrived 2 days later. Just now, ordered a Fitbit. It arrived at the Mississauga sorting centre and once again, it states it may arrive late for the targeted Jan-11 delivery date. It‚Äôs Dec-30. It takes 12 days to deliver a small box from Mississauga? Something is obviously up with the Mississauga sorting centre. Packages don‚Äôt magically disappear. Consistently terrible service."
"HORRIBLE SERVICE.....
My son sent me a parcel from Cagary Dec.11 to B.C paid extra to have it sent xpresspost. it should have arrived by Dec.15. Tried to track it and all it would say is departed Calgary Dec 11. Every time I tried asking my local post office about it all I would get is we don't know anything and it will get here when it gets here...nice thanks for your help. I have called multiple different numbers for Canada Post trying to get answers and all I get is excuses and sent to someone else and they send us back to the first one and so on and so forth. Tried to be sent to a manger the guy says okay a manager will be with you within 30 seconds ....Well 40 mins later still on hold..gave up. I finally called the post office that my son mailed it from and talked to the lady that actually remembers my son and she tells me it might have gone to a facility that got covid and then it would be there possibly for months...omg seriously. Finally I was able to speak with a very nice lady who is actually trying to help me... When i asked her about the whole covid facility excuse she said that she had never even heard of such a thing... proving what i already knew that they will blame covid for them not doing their jobs. I don't usually use Canada Post but i figured since with all the small businesses in Canada shutting down due to covid and courier services are mostly american owned i thought I'd support Canada.... So considering they had to know that they were going to way busier then any other Christmas seasons and knew so for a long time there is absolutely no excuse as to why they didn't have more people working to make sure everything was done properly and efficiently ... thoroughly disgusted by the way the Canada Postal Service and it's employees don't give a toss"
"I have a packahe that came to canada in Nov 25 (processing center), but today is Dec 29, no update, no delivery.
There is no easy way to contact canada post to ask abot my package.
I also had an other package that the seller confirmed my mail address is correct, but canada post deliveried it to the wrong address and told me that they deliveried basing on postal code. I asked if I can have the address of the receiver,, because my name will also be on the package, so I can come to pick it up... they told me they had no record.
what kind of service is it?"
If there was a - star you would get it.Never again will I send Christmas gifts this way.Horrible service for the price.
After 12 days after being processed in Calgary my parcel was sent to Edmonton (should have gone to Richmond) .The Horror story continues!
So today my 2 Christmas parcels have been sitting in Richmond for 3 weeks!! sent from Edmonton to Langley B.C and Powell River B.C!! I have also been waiting for parcels since Nov 23rd!! I can track it with Purolator till it reaches Canada Post then no tracking at all. What Canada Post has done to it`s customers is FRAUD!! They knowingly allowed customers to purchase on time guarantee`s when they knew that since March 18/2020 they suspended all guarantee's!!! I say Class Action Lawsuit!!!
"Two packages left Ontario on December 4th. Only one arrived in Calgary about a week later where it sat for 4 days before it went to Edmonton where it sat for another 3 days. The other package? Just arrived in Edmonton on the 24th where it appears it will sit for another 6 days! Put in a complaint ticket...got an e-mail that told me my package can be tracked online! No kidding!!! I am absolutely appalled at the lack of service. Due to COVID? Really? Tossing packages on doorsteps and ringing doorbells doesn't take as long as personal service! Face it Canada Post...YOU FAILED! As if you didn't know that due to COVID there would be more parcels than normal at Christmas time! What did you do about it in anticipation? NOTHING! Can you imagine going to a till with a full cart of groceries only to see a sign that says ""Due to COVID our tills our closed...please keep checking back.""! No consistency in service at all, not to mention delays and discrepancies in regular letter postage! By the way...this is not a slight against the many, many postal workers who worked tirelessly to deal with the influx, but is to the management of Canada Post who should be ashamed at the mismanagement of the season!"
I ordered 7 products and only recieved 2. Ordered late November and December 3 at the latest. All were expected before December 20th. Some have been in Richmond for over three weeks. Other are in Edmond for almost the same time. Christmas happens every year. It is past time that you look at third parties during peek periods or hirer enough staff like every other company has to! Enough of the excuses!
I had stopped sending/ordering gifts . One company shipped my parcel with Canada Post and you guessed it. 7 days to travel 200kms. My son did not get a Christmas gift. According to tracking it should have been here on 24th. Arrived on 29th. Interact transfers for all gifts now. Shame on you Canada Post
As far as all the shipping providers go I generally have the best luck for on time deliveries with Canada Post. Tracking has always been up to date when I check and despite the craziness of covid I've been fortunate to get my packages in a reasonable time frame
Close these dumps down. A package from Binwang China got to my place faster then an item from 3 hours away. Yet they strike. Bums
"Absolutely awful service, packages don't move for weeks at a time. Customer service is a joke. You pay for express shipping and the package takes even longer than regular shipping. Pathetic."
"Canada Posts so called tracking system is from a time long gone by as we had several different dates given to us for when delivery would come to our home and those dates have come and gone without delivery ... and we're still waiting.

It's also funny that I can send a package from Victoria to Scotland and they receive it within the week and I send a similar package from Victoria to Vancouver and it takes over two weeks to arrive. I guess the secret is to get the package out of Canada to have it delivered in a timely way.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix these issues soon or you'll be losing more than just us as customers!"
"Thanks for screwing up Christmas, Canada Post. Every year, but especially this one.
Can't wait until you guys are gone for good."
"Horrible service. Always some type of issues with packages, constant delays (way before any pandemics). Can‚Äôt deliver a package from Vaughan to Richmond Hill for over 3 weeks. Tracking is terrible and often dates makes no sense. So tired of this constant bs."
Terrible service no straight answers and I paid extra for fast service 3 day it says and it's been 3 weeks package arrived in the destination city in 2 weeks from ship date now it sits over 1 week Canada Post are slack workers really next time I do fed ex or Purolator real next day service Canada Post lies and never meets their own standard. Typical government incompetent workers
"I bought something on November 27th. The original shipping facility is Mississauga. I am living in Toronto. They shipped my package to Vancouver. I called them and they shipped my package back to Mississauga. After few weeks, they send me an email said they will ship my package back to sender. I don‚Äôt know what happened and they have no answer. They asked me to ask sender. I called sender, they have no idea. It is already a month. My package is on hold at Scarborough right now. This is a terrible service. I called their agent few times. They told me this is their shipping route. This is not make any sense."
"Sent a parcel from Thunder Bay on to B.C on Dec 7th Its now Dec 26 and it is still in wpg. since the 8th. Apparently others have been also had same thing happen. Parcels get to wpg. and get long delays there. If this service was privatized they would have been out of business a long time ago. The real problem is Canada Post Winnipeg. Whats going on there and why isnt this problem being fixed? We are talking several weeks in delays from there not days. Dont ship anything west past winnipeg, use another carrier. My family didnt get their xmas gifts even thou I shipped early. I and others deserve our shipping costs reimbursed and an explanation. This is not acceptable and a disgrace to a government funded institution"
"Disappointed with the service!! They should plan ahead of time since Pandemic started March 2020, people are buying online and the volume was increasing and increasing. I wonder what was the plan that was put in the table to accommodate all parcels? I ordered all my gifts online since November and luckily i have 2 arrived..so unfair!! Management should improve service and waste of money hiring more people. Just my thought!!"
"Well, I don‚Äôt know if my review will have an impact or not..considering all the poor reviews already posted, however I need to add my voice.
Even before the Xmas rush, I had 2 Amazon deliveries in 2 months that I was told were ‚Äúlost‚Äù. Fine, I moved on. Amazon refunded me anyway despite the items being marked as delivered (they weren‚Äôt).
Christmas orders started in November...I ordered items for my children and some were lost, some arrived but most were just really REALLY late..as in it is Christmas Day and I had to tell my kids what they were getting rather than physically give them their gifts.
Odd that I had tracking information from the US...detailed, day by day updates...then it hit Canada and all I got was a Canada Post tracking number and after a god damn week it still says NOTHING except to track my own package and that the call center has no additional information.
Canada Post, you have a LOT of frustrated customers. I mean, I actually opted to pay a bunch of money to Purolator my parents‚Äô gifts to them...because I TRUST Purolator. They got their parcel in a day. Intact. Not lost.
I dunno, maybe hire more people, motivated people who will do a good job and try to put your customers first going forward. Listen to your customers...you have had a truly negative impact on the Christmases of Canadian families across the country. Shame on you."
"Ordered Christmas gift for daughter November 30, 2020 from Sportchek. Delivery date was supposed to be by December7th. No updates on Canada Post site until December 15th and said it would be here December 21st. Today is the 25th and it didn‚Äôt come. Very displeased."
"I sent seven packages out on December 5, 2020 all across the country. Only two made it by Christmas day. Terrible service. Don‚Äôt care about excuses. I will use a private courier next time. Screw you Canada post."
Worst service ever. I shipped my bags from ON on Nov.27 and still waiting for the parcel. It is more than one month and there is no information about my bags where are they still in transit. Never use these services.
"My wife's Xmas present shipped Expedited Dec 7th from Ontario to BC. Did not get it for Xmas and have no idea where it is. I ordered items from the US much later and they were delivered well before Xmas! Canada Post...stop using the Covid excuse. You only had 1 year to prepare for the increase of volume and figure out social distancing on the sorting line. Also, if you can't deliver parcels and meet the deadlines of the more expensive shipping methods then just charge one flat rate. Charging for a service you can't provide is against the law. Anything government run is inefficient and that is why we should save OUR tax dollars and privatize that over priced inadequate service."
"If you don‚Äôt care when or if it gets there - use Canada Post, the parcel I sent in early Dec sat in Burnaby for 2 weeks, was updated to out for delivery on the 22 Dec and is now listed as delayed?? This means my daughter had NO gifts for Christmas. The stocking, Christmas pjs, chocolates and gifts in the box will not mean the same as if they had been delivered on time or in the over 3 times the expected delivery time frame."
"Sent parcel Dec 5th, Ottawa to Vancouver. It‚Äôs Christmas Day and it still sits in transit. Almost 3 weeks not to deliver a parcel. Ridiculous. My brother used UPS and sent a parcel to us in 3 days. If you can‚Äôt provide the service then get out. I will never use Canada Post again. Will put my trust with private couriers. This could have been such a successful business line. Fire the management team. It‚Äôs time to close this dinosaur for good."
"My son who lives in BC was not able to come home for Christmas this year. All the family ordered his presents early to ensure they would arrive on time. This year he not only gets to spend Christmas alone but thanks to Canada Post has NO gifts.

With Covid 19 keeping families apart, people feeling very alone and many individuals suffering financially this was not the year for Canada Post to screw up.

Putting out statements about an unprecedented number of deliveries has no merit. You already knew this would be the case and purposely chose not to be proactive and put a strategy in place to deal with the large volume of deliveries. Instead you decided that the customers could suffer. When you don't put the customer first then you don't deserve any kind of loyalty.

I found a posting which states that customers can request Amazon Canada NOT use Canada Post to deliver their packages but use one if the other delivery services. If this is true I encourage everyone to exercise this option going forward and where possible encourage other online retailers to do the same."
"Just a shout out to Canada Post. It seems like everyone has a beef with Canada Post. Well not me. I sent a parcel to my daughter last week, she received it in 2 days, YES 2 days. Then my daugher sent me a parcel on Sunday Dec 20th, later in the day, I received the parcel Wednesday Dec 23rd. She was told that it would probably not make it in time for Christmas, but it did. And no we don't live in the same city, we are about 350km apart. So thanks Canada Post for making both our Christmas's a little brighter. Good Job. Just know that some of us appreciate the job you are doing. üå≤üå≤üå≤üëçüëçüëç"
Why are they not out of business yet.. the worst courier company ever. Cant even expect up to date tracking on their website. So far 2 of my parcels have been delayed more than 2 times. Whats the point of operating a courier service if u cant even provide that service!!! Wish i could give 0 stars.
"Had parcel shipped Dec 11 that was sold as guaranteed 2-3 business days (Xpresspost from BC to Alberta). Online tracking showed delivery extended to Dec 18 but its now Dec 24 and still never arrived (nor is the tracking info updated). Don't sell a guaranteed service for double postage that you can't come anywhere near making the timeline for. Covid is used as an excuse for everything. I have filed a refund request and suggest everyone else do the same. Everyone can find the link by searching for Canada Post Refund. When it asks for a Business Name where you have to input something just put your first and last name. They'll probably say nothing is guaranteed right now but then they should NOT sell a service that they call guaranteed (like Xpresspost) and charge more than just standard delivery. They even list delivery cut off dates online that show Dec 17-18 as cutoff for delivery for Xpresspost... thats obviously not what they could make. We all need to make a fuss and not let them get away with it! I expect at minimum a refund between the cost of xpresspost and standard mail. May even go to media with complaint if they won't willingly refund as they have obviously done this to a lot of people. Every other parcel delivery service I've dealt with this month has made their delivery date within 1 day! Plus us and neighbours have not received any mail, not even a flyer, this week. There is no way we have no mail at all this week. Went to local post office and they claim the only day there was not delivery to our community was Tuesday when there was a snow storm... that doesn't account for the rest of the week. Another post office in the local Rexal said that lots people have complained about missing delivery slips and missing mail... Unacceptable!"
I believe we should take them out of business... PERIOD... who owns this corrupted company....bunch of losers.... The hell with all of you...
"They should just give the mail to a private company, then we might get our parcels on time, or at least get something. I have been waiting at home for 3 days for a delivery to Calgary that should have been delivered by Dec 12/20 . the shipping instructions says no safe drop, meaning I have to be at home when its delivered. The parcel has been in Calgary since Friday18th. The second parcel was ship on November 25, the tracking number shows its still in Winnipeg. I will never again buy from a vendor who ships with Canada Post, or they will not collect payment until it is delivered. The virtual assistant is just totally a waste of taxpayers money, it like the post office, completely useless.
Update: Still nothing delivered today, and no update since yesterday. So 4 days now wasted thanks the super service."
My advise is: if you can not deliver parcel on time do not accept it. Worse experience.
Very disappointed as gifts for two family members not received in time for Christmas with one of these being for a child. Tracking shows its been in Canada with Canada Post for several weeks. All other parcels delivered by other delivery companies were received in just a few days.
"Package status said delivered yesterday at 1:17pm...no one came to my door with my package. Went searching at a post office and was told the status showed delivered and to call customer service. Spoke with a rep who explained that the delivery person scanned it as delivered and that all she could do was open a ticket that will take up to the 30th to review. Explained that it has happened where packages are scanned as delivered and not actually delivered to the customer. Thus package help our daughters Christmas present which is the it thing she actually asked for. Thus is heartbreaking that packages are being stolen this time of year. Rep also said if I haven't received any news by January 2, I should call the sender and have them fix it."
"7 days ago I took a small PKG (1 foot square) containing Xmas gifts for my son and his wife to the Canada Post office in Bobcaygeon Ontario. It was to be shipped to Vancouver BC. The staff person told me I had 2 choices, pay $25 for standard delivery or $62.60 for ""4 day express delivery"". Because I wanted to be sure my son would receive it before Xmas, I chose to pay the ridiculously higher amount of $62.60.

I was given a tracking number and receipt. It took a number of days before any update on the tracking status. After the 4th day it indicated it would be arriving on December 23rd... 2 days later than was paid for but I was okay with that since the gifts would still get there before Xmas. On the morning of the 23rd the tracking said the package was out for delivery and would be there by end of day. I informed my son to watch for it.

This morning December 24, 7 days after paying for 4 day shipping, the package hadn't arrived. I checked the tracking number again and it had updated the status and said the package would now be delivered on December 29th... 2 weeks after sending Express. It also said it was still in Mississauga Ontario.

To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Canada Post, YOUR SERVICE SUCKS! I want a refund! You ruined my Christmas."
"I only reluctantly gave 1 star, 0 would be my preference. We ordered a Christmas gift online from a US vendor on November 28. It shipped Nov29. Tracking shows the parcel received in Mississauga on Nov 30. Our tracking for Canada Post says item delayed. Dec 13 item processed in Edmonton. Dec 16 item departed Calgary. Dec 23 item still not in Lethbridge. My guess is that it sits in a trailer somewhere with a sign on the door that says ""Do not deliver until after Christmas"". Other years I have observed Canada Post deliveries being completed after hours and on weekends, not this year. So they had a delay in Mississauga. Why does that delay need to be in effect after Edmonton? Why is it still in effect after Calgary? This is totally unacceptable, no wonder the courier companies are growing. Canada Post has to shape up or they will be out of business."
"If I could give zero stars, I would! awful awful awful experience. Not only my parcel 'was delivered' 12 days past its date but they never came to deliver it or leave a notice at the door and I live in an independent house, there is no chance someone took my notice paper. The status only changed online saying, they left a notice, what notice? the postman did√†t show up, I was home for the whole day! How convenient is that for the person in charge of the deliveries?! Tomorrow is Christmas, I hope the post office will be open, because if I have no present for my loved ones I am going to be furious! I can't believe this is the professionalism of this country, of 'Canada Post'. No wonder each single one of these reviews has one stars, shame on you Canada Post, shame on you!"
"Very very disappointed in Canada post
I‚Äôm so disappointed with this Canada post service.I will never ever use this again.My sister send me parcel on 23/11/2020 whole they way from India to get me before Christmas.I was waiting their for months ago today.I didn‚Äôt even receive yet then I call customer care they said it‚Äôs already arrived on 18 December which is on Friday I was there waiting for my parcel.but this guy keep lie me.so disappointed unprofessional work Canada post üí©üí©üí©üí© I hate for my whole life"
"The disrespect and Lack of customer service is beyond me these guys should not even be a company how are you called Canada post and can‚Äôt deliver a package on time in Canada, you don‚Äôt even update people on proper times, you give us a tracking number to track what the lies you tell us and truthfully so you guys are playing with my money I need my package, they been lying to me from Friday December 19th Telling me my package has been held back this and that. one of the worst companies I do not care never and I mean never go to these guys because these guys don‚Äôt care about you they lazy whack and ignorant anybody that works with them I really hope you get fired and I hope the business shuts down suck your moms.
Your most hated customer"
They've had my package for a moth with no update. By far the worst company to handle your parcel.
"Canand post and money gram two company combined . I am waiting 7 days for e transfer send by Canada post for money gram to me.
Contact money gram after all the talking i was told money gram dont do e transfer... not even an email for my inconvenience."
"We moved near Simcoe, ON 10 years ago. This small town is well known for its beautiful Christmas Panorama of Lights. Just 2 blocks north lives the Christmas Grinch, aka Canada Post. Before the Pandemic, all was well. We have a PO Box for regular mail and larger parcels were delivered to our door. In June a parcel was Returned to Sender, Not Known at this Address, without an attempt at delivery. In August an Expediated Parcel marked ""leave at the Door"" was taken to a Postal Outlet 2 blocks north of the Post Office. We were notified by email. Why not Knock, Drop and Go? (House too far from Road) was the excuse. This is how CP ""helped"" two senior citizens, caregivers for a son who is immune suppressed. Since March 13 we have been self-isolating under doctor's orders. In desperation we applied for Accommodation delivery in September. CP has agreed to deliver our mail once a week if we put a mailbox 700 m from the road, but the delivery agent refuses to take the mail up a short grade to our door, for her Health and Safety. She doesn't care if one of us with mobility issues, ( the reason we are eligible for Accommodation in the first place) falls while we go up and down the grade to the mailbox. Because we couldn't rely on CP to deliver parcels to our door on time, we didn't even order Christmas gifts for our grandchildren on-line. In our opinion, the Union is making the rules or at least bending them. Our experience with other delivery services, including Purolator, and some voluntary, have been beyond expectations. Delivery agents should remember that if Canada Post goes public, the union and all union perks go with it. Canada Post and its employees job is to deliver the mail including parcels. Do It. No excuses!"
"I understand that with covid-19 a large amount of packages are coming and going but for my package to be sitting in Calgary, AB since December 1st (now the 23rd) and I ordered middle of November is completely unacceptable. There has likely been a huge increase in packages coming and going since the pandemic started- hire more people if needed. When I asked about my packages (Christmas presents for my small children) at my local post office I was told that when the warehouse is full theY park the semi trailer in the lot until room is available, they forgot about this trailer so anyone who ordered packages in the last 2-3 weeks of November are having this issue because the semi was never cleared, again unacceptable.
I contacted Canada Post and they put a ticket out. I received an email saying they have put their ""investigation team"" on it. After 6 days waiting for this email saying they havent received any further scans for this item- UM thanks I can see that via online tracking- thanks but no thanks..

If I could pick ANY other carrier, even if I had to pay significantly more I would just so I didn't have to ship through Canada Post. Absolutely ridiculous!"
"I am so disappointed in the Canada Postal service. I will NEVER use them again. I shipped two parcels from Aurora Ontario on December 11 to my daughter in BC for herself and her 2 boys for Christmas. I paid extra for them to arrive they said in 5 to 6 days. I checked the progress and it stated that the parcels had arrived in Mississauga on December 18. Is this a joke???? Seven days to get from Aurora to Mississauga. It then said on route and would be delivered by end of day on the 21. It now says ""been delayed"" and stay tuned for updates. Now my family will have nothing under their Christmas tree on a year they have suffered so much. So sad. Going forward it will be UPS or FED EX to get my parcels delivered for the date they promise."
Wish that I could give this company negative stars. Delivery times are never accurate which is absolutely f√ªƒák√Æ√±g ridiculous when you are paying so much money for domestic shipping. If you are looking to ship any product please go elsewhere this is the worst company in the world. F√ª√ßk you Canada Post
"Im sorry, but where the heck is my package. I‚Äôve tried giving this company the benefit of the doubt but seeing the other reviews just lowered my expectations completely. Please work on that."
"Canada post is the worst in service, pay very expensive express mail and supposedly it is 1-3 days and it goes 9 days and they still do not deliver it and they made a mistake and left it in another city, this is incredible."
There is seriously something wrong with Canada Post. Without a doubt they are the worst shipping company in Canada. My parcel sent from Mississauga to Calgary has taken over a month to arrive and still not here yet in time for Christmas. Pisses me off. The tracking information is so out of whack and not reliable. Word of advice - DO NOT USE CANADA POST.
Worst service!!! My orders blnever came! I‚Äôve been waiting for 3 weeks now and I need those before Christmas! I suggest you close your company!! Such a garbage! You don‚Äôt have a customer service that can help us with this matter which really sucks!
"I would like to write a review about a specific employee! Her name is Linda, she‚Äôs in an Edmonton post office (bonniedoon) & she is amazing!! I was having a hard time finding where my package was sent since it wasn‚Äôt at my normal post office. She called Canada Post for me and found a phone number & address for me. I had struggled to find this info for 3 full days and she went totally above and beyond.
Thank you Linda, I am so grateful for people like you, who care!!:) merry Christmas!!"
I now hate Canada in general thanks to canada post having failed to deliver my package ordered a month ago. You people suck and do nothing about your god awful postage service that is government ran.
"Two weeks small parcel delivery from Montreal to Ottawa. Deliveries from other services routinely within a couple of days.
Simple conclusion. If you can‚Äôt handle the load, get out of the parcel delivery service and let others earn a living in the delivery business, who can."
where the fucc is my package bro its been 23 days
"We bought 2 items on Dec 5,2020. In beamsville into. We have been waiting and called Canada Post and found out that they sent our package to Calgary. They didn't notify us. They didn't even put a rush on it. Called today. DEC 22. They say it's in Mississauga and still saying it's delivery is expected to arrive on Dec 29. They still wouldnt put a rush. We are only 40 mins away. I said I will drive there and pick it up and she said the facility isn't equipped for that. This is Canada's post screw up and they are not even trying to fix the issue. They just say they are busy. No compesation of any sorts. we are very disappointed with Canada Post. Poor service. Poor handling of their screw ups. They just don't care about the people."
"Canada Post is toooo slowwww!! I ordered some maternity clothing from a well known brand and they shipped my items through Canada post. It's now 3 weeks since the items were shipped, I was supposed to receive the mail a week ago. I live in BC, and my package is stuck in Montreal since a week ago. Now I wonder if the clothes will still fit me when they get to me. Horrible experience.
Why don't they hire more staff if they are overwhelmed with the amount of work?"
"Horrible customer service & way over priced to send things. We Sent our Christmas stuff Dec 9th and they still have no update on there horrible website about the tracking. They just keep saying its a busy time of year expect delays. Its Christmas time of course its busy, shouldnt they expect that. Its been 2 weeks to send a christmas card local mail and our family still have not received them, this company is a joke."
"Ordered a package got to BC on dec 8 got released from customs dec 18 and now dec 22 no update on file called customer service they say its waiting to be picked up by Canada post. Wow so 5 days you just don't go get mail for Xmas time? And then I say it was to be delivered by dec 22 and they say well call back if you don't get it by dec 30. To little to late for Xmas time when you just let it sit there for no reason. I will never buy anything knowing it gets sent by Canada post again
Update. January 5 talk to post office and it is now lost. Thanks"
I have several packages that I thought I ordered well in advance (a month prior to Christmas) and still not here on Dec 22! No updates to the tracking. Frustrated that Canada Post did not hire enough workers for their busiest season. Wish I was given an opportunity to use another carrier with the items I ordered. These packages are only coming from Edmonton (to BC)! I received packages from the US that had to clear customs quicker than this. So frustrating! Use another carrier if you can!
"The worse company ever!!! I could not even believe that something like them even exists! Whenever I see my packages are supposed to be sent by them, I immediately know I will never receive it! There is no scanning, no updates and nothing! Their website is a joke and customer service is terrible! I don‚Äôt know why so many companies use their awful services! This doesn‚Äôt even happen in third world countries! They should be shut down for the sake and mental health of the people, getting paid for nothing, while so many hardworking people have no jobs! Disgusting!!!"
"I bought an item and paid for shipping with a tracking number. The parcel was turned over to Canada Post on December 1 with delivery expected on December 11. I have heard nothing since December 11. When I see a map of it's journey, it doesn't seemed to have moved at all. I think it was turned over to Canada Post and has just sat somewhere since December 1. I need the parcel delivered and a refund for failure to supply the service I paid for. I also have a parcel coming from Hong Kong. No problem with Hong Kong. It has ""been in the air for nine days"" - just not logged in. Beyond poor service. Would not survive as a private business. We need alternate mail service competition."
"If they could get a -10 that is what they deserve. Canada post the most horrific service on the planet. They charge a fortune and cannot deliver anything on time. In the 70s', as a kid in a third world country, the mailmen rode bicycles, they were prompt. enough said."
"Wish I could rate them lower than 1 star. Canada post is an embarrassment. They should be ashamed of themselves. Countless orders are ""delayed"" with no updates in weeks. It seems like when an order hits Richmond BC orders mysteriously go missing... 6 Amazon orders to be exact, within the past 2 months... Customer service is non existent. I will never ship with Canada post again. I will ship Purolator or FedEx or a company that actually knows how to deliver parcels. I get that it's Christmas time and its busy, but get your $hit together you bunch of lazy fuks"
"Less than one star. My Prepaid post boxes were delivered to my address, I was the SENDER!! I live in Calgary and one box was to go to Ottawa, the other to Fredericton. Dropped off again at post office. Canada Post has been no help. Mailed them out December 7, received at my address Dec. 9, take them back to post office and remailed again Dec. 9 with the clerk printing in red ink ‚Äúto‚Äù and ‚Äúfr‚Äù (even though clearly states to and from on claim ticket) and putting ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù in red on the box!! It‚Äôs now Dec. 21 and they are back being processed AGAIN in Calgary!!! Receivers addresses correct, under the weight restriction. Almost $60 for that ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù service. As of this minute, I have no idea where they are to end up next. I mailed them early to get there before Christmas.
Phone number at Canada Post is useless, they have no desire to help anyone."
Complete garbage company. No accountability and no response to enquiries. Will not use this company to send or receive anything ever again.
"I would rate this service a -1000 if I could. My Parcel on amazon says it has departed Richmond, Bc on the 6th of December( it is the 21st today) and I live in Alberta. I know it does not take over two weeks to move from BC to Alberta. Disgustingly awful service, I do not recommend."
If I could give Canada Post zero stars I would. In fact I would give them - 1000 stars. They are the worst company. They are an embarrassment to Canada.
"Tell me how my package goes from out for delivery to ""oh things have been delayed and will update you when we feel like it"". Their customer service also basically compromises of answering machines and robots. Embarrassment to have as a national postal service."
"Terrible terrible carrier to have your parcels order through, takes for ever, do not up date the tracking info, hard to contact, it‚Äôs stupid,
Shouldn‚Äôt even be a company! All the other company‚Äôs no issues delivering on time or just having decent customer service, I hate it when I‚Äôm scheduled with Canada post for a delivery, you‚Äôll never get it or you‚Äôll be in a grave by the time it arrives."
Parcel says it was delivered but was no received or found. Tried to contact but they make communication impossible. Tried to create a service ticket but would not let me get past step 1 and would not tell me why. How are they even a professional company??
"I ordered my daughter her birthday gift for her 18th birthday by Canada post. Shes 2 right now. Should arrive just in time, 16 years from now."
Pretty sure they lost my package never got processed and I ordered it over three weeks ago. The rep I talked to was good but very disappointed with how long my other package is taking and the poor care put into taking care of my package as they have obviously lost it.
"Here on my street we see Puro , Intelcom , UPS etc. All after 5pm and on the weekends too...why my order is taking more then 15 days to arrive, and still not there is unbelievable"
What a horrible experience with Canada Post and their staff at Spadina. I don't understand where and how they get these people to deal with customers. Never again.
Once again I am deeply disappointed in Canada Postal Service! I send a parcel to Vancouver by express post and it still has not arrived at its destination.I send it last weekend to have enough time for it to arrive.It is since the 18. December in Richmond Hill/BC and won't arrive til Tuesday at its destination.Seven business days via express? I am very disapointed and appalled.They call that express post?Shame on Canada Post!!!!
"Too bad one can not rate below 1 star. Our friends in Markham are still waiting for an envelope that was mailed from Ottawa 3 weeks ago. Never thought of hiring a walker or Pony Express which would have been faster. The service is horrible or perhaps even horrific. Too bad the crew is unionized as the ""I don't give a ""damn"" attitude is definitely showing thru."
"Take more than 10 days to deliver package from Toronto to Ottawa, and their forwarding feature doesn't activate before 5 business days + cost 60 bucks. What a lame delivery company. Got a package from NYC to Ottawa in 3 days with DHL...
Edit : we are now 3 days after the review, the package finally arrived to Ottawa, but left to Toronto again the very same day without even trying to deliver it at my house or a nearby post office. üòÇüòÇ I think Canada Post is trying his best to f*** up Christmas. Really a garbage company."
Poor excuse off a company at all. As an internet company I am receiving multiple requests daily for tracking. On buying expedited postage the comment is still item should arrive on time. Many items still show as not going beyond the scan of my local post office although they have been received? Some items are making it to destination in days while others are many weeks late? As if the COVID crisis has not been hard enough on small buisness Canada is now dropping the postal support that on lines rely on. The irony is if customers complain and return item late cp likely gets another sale! Glad that most of my clients are understanding but guessing this will do irreversible damage to Canadian online companies.
"Terrible service, I realize this is a busy season but have 3 parcels from Amazon delayed for no reason. Picked up over a week ago in Calgary to be delivered to Carstairs, carrier pigeons would have been faster. I was being told delivery by tomorrow, now it‚Äôs an unexpected delay. This is not acceptable."
"Slowest courier. I understand it‚Äôs busy during holidays but there‚Äôs been no updates since my parcel left a processing centre over 16 days ago (ON to BC). There have been two estimated delivery dates removed due to unforeseen delays. I‚Äôve had other parcels shipped after this order and delivered on time by different couriers. Unfortunately I did not have a choice in the delivery service otherwise I would have never chosen Canada Post. The only items they deliver on time are flyers.

Update: Finally updated status to out for delivery (22 days since item was shipped)... unfortunately it‚Äôs been 3 days now and keeps getting delayed for next business day. How do they even update the status to out for delivery for three days in a row but still hasn‚Äôt been delivered?! Wow, this company is run by fools."
Worst company to be employed by. Anyone with a disability whether it being mentally or physically management does not care what so ever. It's well known that the reputation of Canada Post is diplorable and the corporation is run by useless and weak management whom see it's employees as a commodity that is disregarded and being disposed of regardless of being unionized. . Anyone with any sort of self respect and self worth should avoid Canada Post as a career or a employment possibility.
Freakin thief's refuse to take accountability. Have 2 packages in Mississauga on the 11th 1 is delivered the other hasnt moved! Pieces of garbage is what they are I would rather pay I respected courier then trust Canada help your selfs to others property
"Worst services ever!
They had delayed my packages for almost 3 weeks. It took more than 3 weeks to ship from QC to Toronto!!!!"
"Canada post has always been a very poor service. i have a parcel that was picked in bc and has been in their processing facility since the 9 of dec 2020, however, their tracking information say its been in transit since then longest trip to Edmonton for expedited parcel even the mule express would be quicker."
One star is waaaay too much. the tone of the voice of the lady wasn't too friendly and I got an impression she was doing me a favor she talks to me. Not helpful at all.
BELOW 0000000. They are the worst company ever
this company is disgusting they will take your package and steal it without even refunding you for the delivery fee. warning do not use canada post they are the least trust worthy delivery company in canada.
I have had problems over and over again with Canada post with the delivery lady throwing my stuff on the stairs accusing me of stealing and now I have waited for a package for over a month and I can‚Äôt seem to get a answer from Canada post on where it is
Horrible shipping your lucky if you ever get your stuff still waiting for mine to show up over a week late.
"Embarrassing excuse for a delivery service. My package was picked up at the sellers location on Dec.3 last update was on the 9th saying it has been delayed. No one at Canada Post can tell me where it is or when to expect it! It is now almost the 18th and 10 days past ‚Äútheir‚Äù delivery standard date of the 8th.
I‚Äôve had packages from Europe ship after this one and arrive yesterday.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just embarrassing Canada Post.
If you were an employee of mine you would be terminated immediately."
What joke of a postal service. I have lived in many cities around the world and Canada's Postal service is by far the worst. Their delivery guarantees are rarely actually honoured and when they are it is like some fluke
"I ordered a package that had expedited shipping, coming from Calgary to Edmonton. About 3 weeks later and after they changed the delivery date at least 3 times, I finally phoned them. They put an inquiry on my package and told me to wait and someone will contact me in the next few days. A couple days later I got an email from them. They had finished the inquiry, and the results were in: package has not been delivered! I was told there‚Äôs nothing else they can do for me and to contact the seller. Good job Canada post on losing my package and then doing superior detective work into finding the problem! What a joke of a company."
"Awful, unknowledgeable and unfriendly staff. My parcel is 4 days late, and they can‚Äôt tell me if they have it, let alone when I can expect it. I waited 45 mins on the phone just to find out they don‚Äôt know how to help me, other than to keep checking online. At one point the customer service representative said: ‚Äúthere are orders from over a month ago that are still being held back‚Äù... how is that helpful to me?? So there‚Äôs no way to know if I can expect it in a day, a week, a month, a year??? I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would work with this company."
"placed an order for computer parts on black Friday and the last time any information was updated was on the 8th of December. I have passed 3 estimated delivery dates, i have spent time on their useless phone service that repeats the same information over and over and literally just restates the website, and i have tried to create a support ticket but it tells me that i can't make a ticket because they havent recieved the item yet. The error message from trying to create a ticket gave me more information then i had ever recieved from them. It still says it's gunna come today but the ticket said they haven't recieved the item yet."
"They have 2 of my orders from Amazon that haven't moved for a whole week. Another one of my orders from Walmart is apparently in transit but doesn't even show tracking info on the Canada Post website. My Walmart order has been with them for 7 days and they still haven't sent it or updated tracking info. I guess my order from walmart doesn't exist it says ""we didn't find an item associated with this number"". Don't use Canada Post shipping for anything you won't get it when it's expected to be delivered."
"If you ordered from Amazon and it‚Äôs shipping by Purolator or UPS you are in luck, and not only will the tracking be accurate you will get your package on time (if not early)....if it happens to ship by Canada Post, well, get ready for ‚Äúdelayed due to external factors‚Äù, no updates for days and days, and just plan on your Amazon order status line to immediately go purple that it may show up late the moment it ships...it‚Äôs like Amazon knows that if it ships by Canada Post their system might as well just flag right away that the orders are going to arrive late (if at all)"
Thieves I‚Äôm sure. Where are all the lost packages? Yes you get your money back but it sucks.
How are they even charging such ridiculous prices for shipping still? I am still waiting on an expedited parcel that has been sitting at the sorting facility 20 mins from where I live. Its been there for 3 weeks.
"Aside from some random issues over the the years I have had no issues with Canada Post. They deliver my cannabis on time, my mushrooms and everything else I order. I've only had one package not get delivered because of a stupid temp worker who can't read addresses. This package was sent back to the US...it was a Christmas gift....O_O

All in all Canada Post has been really good for me."
"I'd give 0 stars if possible, Canada Post is the worst mail service in Canada period.
I ordered an item online a couple weeks ago its a few hundred dollars, after a week of the tracking saying its been picked up and is in transit I called to find out just whats going on.. they act as tho they know nothing and blame Covid and Christmas... I told them that somthing coming from 4 hours away does not take a week to get to its sorting destination, all they would say is they can open a ticket on the package... and then watch it and see what happens..BS... after a day or 2 I get an email saying in x number of days I can call them back and they will tell me the next steps... BS.... I call back now they want to launch an investigation... ha ha ha... they admit its lost in there care but guess what.... they won't pay for the item that they were entrusted to deliver... nope... they pretty much told me to bad we screwed up deal with it... your loss we tried our best what more do you want from us... I loathe Canada Post... fortunately for me the company I ordered from put insurance on my package and sent me out another.. but this time through a Real Courier.... Never ever entrust Canada Post with your packages... and if you have letter mail your probably better off using Email to ensure whomever your mailing will actually receive your letter..
Never again will I use their services... liers and thieves that only care about their money not their customers or their customers packages/mail ect..."
Canada post has become so terrible even before covid 19 its taking 6 weeks for something to come from montreal to kelowna .. just terrible üòû everytime i get something by canada post its super late ups quick dhl quick pitney bows quick but no not canada post what the hell is your excuse
"We have ordered many Christmas gifts this year from Amazon and without an exception, the only negative issues we've encountered are the items shipped via Canada Post, They don't arrive!

Does the Canadian government not listen to the hundreds of customer complaints about Canada Post's lack of service? CP are a joke and the customers are not laughing. Any other delivery service would be out of business by now and deservedly so."
I never want to use this slow garbage postal service again. Absolutely horrible and a big waste of tax payer dollars. Hire people that actually enjoy their job and hire people that actually care. I hope all of the employees are reading these reviews. It's actually sickening and I'm tired of this nonsense.
"Well this review won't help me to get my package but the venting may help me feel a bit better. Why does Canada Post ALWAYS just leave a pick up card in our mailbox to pick up our package???? We are seniors and home a lot and when tracking says it's out for delivery, we make sure we are home all that day but they never ever attempt to deliver it. Next thing we know tracking says delivery attempted, no one home, notice left!! Funny how the notice doesn't get left until the next day too. We are seniors and especially don't feel like waiting 1/2 hour in line to pick up each parcel...especially during COVID!! They need to revamp the whole company, fire everyone and give jobs to people who want to actually do their job. Merry Christmas everyone!"
I ordered my package in MID NOVEMBER. It is mid December. A month? I ordered packages last week using different services and they arrived on time or even early! This type of stuff makes me want to stop ordering from companies such as best buy because you guys don't know how to properly ship item. My item is going back and forth and is now just sitting in Mississauga. Either get yourself together or you and other business who support you will begin losing customers. This is ridiculous.
"Would like to share the email Canada Post sent me as an answer to a ticket/investigation I opened for an item not received/delivered.

""Dear Customer,

Our investigation into your request indicates that no scan has been uploaded to the Canada Post tracking system to indicate delivery of your item.

We appreciate the concern associated with this shipment. At Canada Post, we strive to provide exceptional service and the best delivery experience possible and security of the mail is a top priority at Canada Post.

Any further action must be initiated by the sender of the item. If you have still not received the item, please notify the sender and instruct them to contact Canada Post if they wish to initiate a claim.""

As I do understand the Canada Post must have some good people working there, and have no intention to offend anyone - how far does incompetence go ? Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone !"
"Day after day of ""will be delivered by the end of the day."" then suddenly ""your package is delayed."" Originating delivery point half-hour from my home. What a POS non-delivery service."
"So I ordered some items on Amazon, all great reviews, and valid purchases, (not from like, China). I have ordered from Amazon in the past, and have gotten my things through FedEx and UPS, great experiences. This time it was being sent through Canada Post. I live in Alberta, and I have tracking for the packages. They all arrived in Airdrie, so it would only make sense for it to arrive quickly, right? Well, apparently not seeing as 1 went to Mississaugua and 2 went to Penticton?? They were literally in Alberta, it makes no sense!! What reason would there be to send them, after they were already only 2-3 hours away from they were supposed to be delivered, to a whole 3 provinces away!!??
TL; DR:
Canada Post sucks and delivered my package to the area I live, and then shipped them to the opposite side of the country and won't let me know how long my packages are delayed for."
"After 20 min waiting on the line, an agent answered the call, got all the data during 15 min and told me will pass me to another agent and I had to wait about 45 min and the new agent asked for all the data again and put me to wait another 15 min then he gave me a ticket number and to wait 10 business days."
"I am sick to the stomach and here is why. I ordered an item for my birthday in July and the seller used Canada Post, I waited 5 weeks for this item that was shipped from Ontario to Edmonton, only to be told item was lost. Fast forward to November, I ordered an item for my boyfriend's birthday, seller used Canada Post again, birthday is over without receiving item, I suspect my item is missing again because tracking shows ""Notice Left"", there was NO notice left anywhere! I work from home, there was no attempt at delivery. I reached out to customer service, they said my item can be picked up at Shoppers, they gave me a notice number and pick up time, I have gone there twice already, my item isnt there. This is so painful. I wish and pray sellers can boycott this company, I will pay 100% more for an alternative."
"Would prefer Negative rating possibly
I received my letter after 3 loooong weeks, which should have been here in 2 days. That too burnt!!!! Yes, BURNT. In a plastic bag stating ""We sincerely regret"" and you can call this this number. Ofcourse just to be on hold for long time. I mentioned to them just let me know what happened, because they are not going to do anything - get answer ""Why are you calling us then?"". Girl I just said, atleast let me know what happened!! The final answer - ticket have been submitted to investigate, but I will never know what happened
What am I supposed to do with this letter, which has most of the information burnt out.
I just don't understand one thing. If everyone knows that Canada Post is this bad, Why don't they CHANGE PROVIDERS??? Stop using them, causing so much grief. I guess we customers are ok paying a little more money to ensure that our mail/package gets to us, rather than loosing our stuff or receive it in an unusable condition."
"Canada post is the worst mail delivery option that exists.
Their website rarely works, and when it does is so horribly configured and put formatted it looks like it is a website from the 90s and it works about as well.

Canada Post milks excuses for all they are worth. Their phone message warning about the high call volume should just say, ""we always experience high call volume and refuse to hire more staff or audit the staff we do have to make sure they are working so it is going to be a ridiculously long wait. We probably wont solve your problem anyways so don‚Äôt call back.‚Äù

Canada post is the only company that goes out of their way to make their services difficult to use. You want to reprint a document? Well you had better remember not only the tracking number but also the date it was sent and the type of shipping document that you want to print. Canada post damages/ destroys your package? Well be prepared to jump through tons of hoops to get only the cost of postage back instead of the value of what was damaged.

Save yourself time and money in the dend and ship with any other courier. While Canada post may trick you into thinking that their service is cheap and reliable, it is not.
Canada Post should not exist anymore since their employees seem determined to do as little as possible on their govt. wages.
Canada Post please update everything about your crummy business or shut down and let the other good courier companies have your infrastructure like PO Boxes."
"Worst service ever. They ""lost"" my package, even though they confirmed the correct adress. Then asked me to wait 3 business days for them to investigate, only no one ever gets back to you or provides any kind of update. I contct them and wait 49 minutes to be connected to someone and they simply say contact the sender we cant find your package and disconnect the line. The absolute most unreliable service you could imagigine. This is the 3rd package they have lost this year."
"I ordered a package, got the slip telling me where to pick it up (at a Shopper's Drug Mart. Pretty standard).

I go there - the package number doesnt exist. Canada Post never scanned my package. I tried calling them several claims, but their customer service has literally been trained to attack me personally and hang up, when I insist that I have a package slip from my mail box. Ridiculus.

This company should be shut down, filthy scammers."
"Horrible experience. I understand there may be small delays with Christmas and Covid, but I was encouraged to pay Priority to send a very important scholarship due on Dec. 15th and was guaranteed it would arrive on time. The date kept pushing back in time until it eventually said it would arrive AFTER the deadline of the scholarship and guaranteed date. $35 spent for my item to arrive 5 days later than it's supposed to when paying priority! Waited on the phone over an hour for customer service. Terrible service and terrible company."
"I was going to be nice and give you three stars but this company is not capable of doing a proper job. I'm not surprised at all to see all of the one star reviews, they are honestly very deserving. I don't blame anyone, Very unreliable and slow. I order stuff from BC fairly often and it's usually at my house in two days (Alberta) which is perfectly acceptable and expected but any longer and it's a big inconvenience. I've learned to avoid the expedited shipping and only use Xpresspost. At the time I'm writing this review I've been waiting on package from BC and it's been a week. Changes have to be made, too many people are having problems and nothing they say or do is justified. Get it together or people will start using other services, services that can actually be counted on. When it's good it's good but when it's bad it's really BAD."
"Canada Post has some of the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. This isn't the first time that I have physically been at home and had the delivery driver drop off a delivery slip instead of the package without even knocking on the door. I literally have no clue what the purpose of getting something delivered is if you have to leave the house to go pick it up anyways. This feels extremely lazy. I haven't ever experienced this with any other delivery company, and have been receiving multiple packages from companies like Amazon over the last few months."
"There's a scam running out of Richmond with Canada Post.

Reading other reviews and through the simple fact that TWO purchases, this month, from the same clothing store shipped to me, have disappeared in Richmond, BC.

This seems to be the common denominator for December 2020, that anything of resale value passing through Richmond is at a high risk of going missing. Check your damn employees!

Regardless, horrible service. Horrible customer service. Fake Xpress post. Undelivered mail. High rates. Dismissive and disregarding of anything important. Careless service. Poor security.

I'm also disappointed to hear of the 25,000 square foot warehouse that houses all our ""lost"" or stolen items, which Canada Post then sells off at a later date. Shameful."
Absolutely horrible. I have no words to describe how bad Canada Post is. I can only feel bad for everyone that has to associate themselves with Canada Post. Ridiculous.
"i've been waiting for almost 1 long month now, i placed an order on 30 Nov 2020, it was suppose to be delivered in 2 days. I've called them, the agents kept hanging up on me, i went to their online chat and 2 of the employee's also closed the chat on me, but the 3rd person helped after i told her i will be complaining about them and leaving them a review. It was like that with Canada post before the pandamedic began, my packages from them never ever come on the delivery due date, it's always 1 to 2 weeks behind. I took screen shots of my conversations and also the screen shots for the shipping which kept changing the date so i won't be able to open up a ticket, also the agents i spoke to, 2 of them who were terrible with no help, one of their names was LOLA, the second's person name was RAGHUVEER, neither of these 2 employees had a last name available so you couldn't even complain about them. I'm sure the only excuse they give you is that the chat got disconnected which is a lie, people love to lie now days. If there was a way for me to post the pictures here i would do that, but i don't see any options for that so i decided to just leave them a review by explaining as much as i can. BestBuy need to switch over to someone else for their shipping method, Canada Post is pure garbage and does not care for their members, their staff refuses to give you what you want and make you wait for even longer periods of time, so here i am leaving them the review they deserve, nothing less. I just thought everyone should know how they are, not like anyone will be able to do anything but atleast with the reviews people should have a heads up, so they don't end up waiting like i do for days and days before the arrival of your product."
"Truly awful claims service. I shipping two guitars, one in 2016, and one in 2020, both arrived damaged. One was even shipped in a flight case, and arrived with a shattered headstock. Both claims were initially denied. I fought for weeks to get the second claim covered. The first claim which I had purchased $1000.00 coverage for they paid out $100.00, after literally months of dealing with them. If you have to make a damage claim, be prepared for a long, difficult battle."
Time to privatization
Had a package sit for more then a week in calgary. After one week the tracking said expected delivery the next day. The next day it not says they dont know whats going on and hace no updates for another week. How does my package tracking go from delivery in 24 hours to more then a week of waiting for an update?
"Order an jacket from Moose Knuckle November 18th it was shipped and out for delivery on the 20th of November,2020 in Pickering Ontario that‚Äôs where I live. On December 9th, 2020 after several attempt Canada post confirm the package is now lost. The tracking shows the barcode last scanned in Montreal Qc. It was Suppose to be a birthday gift for my Son."
"Over the past few years I have gotten several hundreds of packages delivered to multiple addresses from a number of delivery services. Canada Post is by far and without doubt the worst company by a long shot. They routinely deliver late, miss track and loose packages. Avoid using them if at all possible."
"Ordered an item, shipped out of Ontario. Instead of coming to Nova Scotia it arrived in some backwater cow town in Alberta several days ago and ... that's it. Ridiculous. This after the theft of an $1100 item -- tracking shows nothing after drop-off at the post office and it has been 3 weeks."
"Terrible. Their tracking of a very important, very large and expensive package was completely over looked, and the parcel is now 15 business days overdue, with absolutely no record or where it is, or when it will be delivered. The last notice is when I dropped it off at the post office in Campbell Rive 3 full weeks ago. Their tracking is NOT 100% accurate at all! I have had more than a few issues with parcels with Canada Post. I paid extra to make sure the parcel was signed for, and delivered within 4 days, and apparently that is of no consequence what so ever. i was sent an email saying that a ticket had been started, and would hear from them by today. No surprise, I have not heard from them. Their idea of an investigation is to email the receiver, 3 weeks after it's over due and ask them if it arrived."
"Work from home and got a delivery notification for today and never got a knock, only to find a note sitting pretty in my mailbox for pickup. These guys are the definition of laziness."
"This is fast becoming a slackers paradise...excuse after excuse and CP doesn't even know exactly where my package is. Just groping in the dark.
Sad really, since this is yours and mine paid for by our tax dollars.
If they anticipated a busy Xmas, then prepare! Every year it is the same whine...""due to heavier than normal"" ...well duh, its christmas season...stop sniffing the label glue and get with it..jeez!"
"I‚Äôve ordered items online twice now, and each time Canada Post takes their sweet time delivering it. They don‚Äôt update the tracking information so I am left clueless as to where my package is and when it will be delivered. They are a garbage delivery service and don‚Äôt know how to follow simple instructions. I live in a basement suite that is accessed from the back door and they did not attempt to knock or leave the package at my door (its only a few clothing items) and then I was forced to pick it up at the nearest Canada Post for a fee resulting in over $15. I will never understand the incompetence of this company."
I understand there are issues with COVID but I bought two packages and paid the maximum shipping cost to make sure I get the items in a reasonable time. One item sat in Ontario for 9 DAYS before finally moving. Another one is in the next city over and it's coming on day 5 sitting there and not moving. It is a scam to charge people more for shipping but have item shipped at the lowest cost move faster. Their whole system is broken and I wish companies would stop using them. STOP ACCEPTING PACKAGES WHEN YOU AREN'T ABLE TO HANDLE THEM!
There delivery service and standard has really gone downhill. They don‚Äôt have a clue where any package is and 10 days over delivery standard and counting. This is absurd.
"Unreliable, incompetent, , unskillful, not trustworthy, useless, pretenders, like EVERYTHING else in canada."
"Just learned today that some random bureau of clearly garbage statistics has rated Canada Post as the #9 national delivery service in the world.


Curious what world they live in, and how do I go there?
Because in this reality, the steaming pile of hot garbage that is Canada Post is so god-awful that the only time I ever get packages from them is when I want things that aren't on Amazon - so like, once a year -
And Canada Post's service, quality, and speed are lacking to non-existent.
Every.
Single.
Time."
"Extremely poor and deceptive business practices.
I think north Korea has a more reliable and considerate postal service.
Canada Post will just deliver your package whenever they want. Forget about checking tracking, it's entirely deceptive. I have had a multiple packages with tracking that told me it was being delivered ""that day"" for 4 business day's straight.
Pure laziness and tyranny. That's what Canada Post stands for."
"Its been now 12 days canada post hass lost my computer graphics card ... i cant even trace it , if you have the choice , choose intelcom/fedex/ups , they are 100% more trustable !"
"My order was coming from Ontario, and later it went to BC (I don't know how) and I live in Calgary. I wonder why it says ""item delayed"". After 13 BUSINESS DAYS, I still had no expected delivery date. I called to see if they can call me as soon as my order comes to Calgary so I can pick it up myself, and their word was check online and call us back once it says the item is in Calgary. Mind you the online update happens a day or two later as per my honest observation. They wont even cooperate for those who want to do their job. Once it came to Calgary 15 days later, I gave them a call and they told me I can only come and pick it up once they are unable to deliver it! How annoying and frustrating can they be?"
terrible delivery time its now been 15 days it shows it has been in richmond for the last 5 days but no delivery and no telling when it might be delivered use the professionals fedex or ups
"The worst shipping company in the developed world. Im sure there are couriers in Africa that have better service than these fools. They define lazy, don‚Äôt give a single care about their customers yet take as much money as they can from you. I believe they are corrupt and are probably getting large kickbacks from the government. Canada post is essentially organized crime."
"i was supposed to get my package on the 8th, it got delayed until the 10th. now it‚Äôs delayed until the 15th. i‚Äôm seriously so annoyed."
Late delivery and extremely expensive. being scam by your country services is fun
"Ordered same day on Amazon two orders One order arrived as per schedule by Intell Courier 3 day delivery the other by Canada Post 6 days in Local Postal facility and counting Despatched 30/11/20 from Montreal arrived Halifax 03/12/20.Still waiting delivery.
Canada Post you're useless as a chocolate bbq and if were a ghost you couldn't frighten a toddler."
"Delivery time is absoloutely disgusting!!!! DONT EVER USE THIS JOKE OF A DELIVERING SERVICE! has been in transit for over 1 week now. the expected delivery was updated to ""tomorrow"" ever since! It says my parcel has been in my city for the last week. So c onfusing and dissapointing stay away from this."
"While taking out the garbage this morning (about 9:30am) I saw the letter carrier and said ‚Äúhello.‚Äù We had a short pleasant exchange and I jokingly asked if some of the packages he was delivering - immediately next door - were for me. He said ‚Äúno‚Äù and we chatted about getting coal for Christmas and laughed.

Not 10 minutes later I went to collect my mail and there was a delivery attempt slip in my mailbox. I just spoke with the man! And my car was in the driveway!!

Now I have to line up, during a pandemic, at the post office to get my parcel. Guess who‚Äôs going to be taking to you bright and early tomorrow morning..."
"I try to avoid Canada Post when I can, but we have no choice as to the shipper some retailers choose. My parcel's expected delivery date has been pushed back three times now. It has now been 9 days since the parcel information was electronically submitted by shipper, 7 days since parcel was picked up. Still waiting......Calgary---->Lethbridge!"
"DON'T EVER TRUST CANADA POST. They ""lost "" my watch. Actually, stole it. Oh, and here's another thing the reps do, they gender discriminate. Yes, they do. I get it every time I speak to their crappy reps on the phone. They're incompetent. They have no clue what the f you're talking about when you ask where's my parcel? 3 weeks later, STILL NOT HERE. NO UPDATE IN SITE AT ALL. NOTHING. THEY LIE. the only thing I recommend, TAKE IT TO THE OMBUDSMAN."
"Disgusted with their training.

Trainer only sometimes would put his mask on when taking but never had it on while at his desk not far away from the trainees.

Seven days of computer b.s. To them never use one again. So very company like.

Get the people who are on computers all day to write up a training program for outside work. Terrible.

No on job training means I did not get through as I needed it for the hand service they use.

Got ripped off by Canada post because they shorten and paid less for training at their busy time every year.

One week in the field for training was not available they said. Lol

Gives me two days to know every button on their hand device without even looking at it.

What a joke. Glad I moved from that horrible ordeal. Rude staff, unhelpful hr.

Not a good place to work said a couple of the employees there I was talking to.

Getting a lawyer involved to get more compensation from them.

Shorten training but not the testing.

Disgusted at Canada post"
"I would give zero stars if I could!
Sent an expedited package to an address 2 hours away and 8 days later still no delivery. Every day they change the ""expected delivery"" but haven't updated tracking since I dropped it off at my local outlet.
Terrible company! Not the only issue I've had with them but if this isn't resolved I will go out of my way to use other carriers."
"Horrible. Once an item arrives at the black hole known as Canada Post just go ahead and tack on an extra 1-2 weeks to your expected delivery date. Nothing and I mean absolutely nothing arrives on time. Your tracking status will get set to an infinite ""In Transit"" designation and it will stay in that status for weeks with no explanation and no means to inquire. It's unacceptable so I recommend avoiding any merchants that use their services."
"My beef with Canada Post, is their atrocious tracking system. The tracking used to have only 2 messages: Item picked up, and item delivered. With no updates in between.
It has now changed to guessing or lying about the status of the package. I have had 3 items delivered in the last month by Canada Post, and they are really peeving me. Every single one of them say they will be delivered by dated X. They are tracked to the ""out for delivery stage"". On the expected delivery day, I receive my regular mail, but no package. Late in the day the status will change to unexpected delay, with no specific delivery date. Then the package show up 1-3 days later, with no further explanation. Did the package get lost in the delivery truck? How else is it out for delivery, then unexpectedly delayed?
Actually, one of these packages turned out to just be a delivery card, stating that there was no one here 'sorry we missed you'. BS. I was working by the front door and no one came to the door, but my mail was delivered to the mailbox. Nothing like paying to have something delivered, then you have to go pick it up. It kind of defeats the purpose of delivery."
"I waited over the estimated period 2 times for a package over 400 and still haven't received it. Absolutely ridiculous, i still placed orders with other companies like UPS and received my package on time."
"The worst way to send anything, always late then lie. Dropped off after 4 means a week late in their minds. Insurance is worth nothing because they just don‚Äôt respond to your claim, same with complaints!"
The Haliburton branch is by far the worst example i have ever seen for being reliable. It seems some people cant tell the difference in numbers . I think there is a difference between 1453 and 1960. A daily pick up would be nice also. Hard to run a company when they dont bring me my information. When i called they simply said they were busy and choices had to be made as far as what areas they delivered to daily. If i had of done that with my job i dont think i would be employed very long. The worst branch ever.
11 years of temporary mail forwarding and every 11 years problems. Some of the years I would spend 10+ hours trying to fix. Now I trying again.
"Once again Canada post does not deliver on time ! Package has been in Calgary since Thursday night , today is Monday and expected delivery date was Friday and I still don‚Äôt have my package ! Thanks again for not doing your hob Canada post! They should not be allowed to deliver anything but standard paper envelopes. Anything else never comes on time ! Waste of tax payers money!!!"
"My sister sent me a package that she worked hard on and spent a lot of money on shipping and items and made food. Canada post said it would take 6 days to deliver, they held it on the border for inspection and kept it a week extra , all the food expired and got moldy. Canada post won‚Äôt say anything on this and they wouldn‚Äôt give us teaching info. She worked vary hard for this package and Canada post basically threw it away. When she called to ask where it was they didn‚Äôt respond."
"Canada post has deleted my apartment number on very package I have ordered in the last three months. I make sure I include the number every single time have something shipped by them, and they screw it up every time. They won't even let me correct it before the package has shipped, you actually have to wait for them to try and fail the delivery, then you can make a request and wait SEVEN days for them to do something about it. Sometimes the package just gets sent back in that time. Oh ya, and you're not allowed to pick it up from the depot like you would be with every other postal service. This company is a totally useless government funded waste of tax dollars."
I would like to mention that I am a loyal and trustworthy business man that sells on eBay and I've recently encountered problems with shipping with Canada Post. I gave a package mail to ship within the United States and my mail was ripped open by one of the delivery people. I am not pointing fingers but this led me to lose my item and also lose money on my eBay sales which was not reimbursed in anyways because this was regular shipping. Unfortunately since eBay has a weird policy that if no tracking or shipping is provided the buyer gets 100% their money back the seller loses everything here... I'm sorry to say but this system is unloyal and I couldn't believe my eyes that people from the post mail have the decency to steal items that have no tracking whatsoever on them just to gain a little bit of money. I am most displeased also with their method of helping me as this is for sure something that can atleast be semi-refunded even if not fully refunded...
"If I could rate as a minus one I would. Canada post has to be the worse postal company I have ever used. I order from anywhere in the world and track it, takes a few days only to travel over seas or the states but then as soon as it enters canada, and goes to the processing facility (which is only 30 mins from my home) for onward delivery to my address it then takes weeks. You would think during a pandemic where there is lockdowns and everyone is ordering they would hire more people. Pandemic is used as the perfect excuse for them to be extra slow and lazy. It's a DISGRACE"
"Postal delivery from Hampton, Ontario is the worst. Lies about 'attempted delivery'. Just fills out the slip and the package never leaves the post office. I have the screenshot of the timestamps for proof.
Fresh snow on the driveway, and no tire tracks or footprints, PLUS, I WAS HOME!
Canada Post protects and rewards lazy, indifferent employees. Doesn't care that I can't get to the post office because I work during the day and I can't get my package!
The whole point of mail delivery, is to deliver it!! The postal carrier claims they don't want people coming into the post office because of Covid; but refuses to deliver the packages and we have to pick them up???!!!
I work from home, so don't tell me you filthy LIARS that you 'attempted delivery', I work from home, fresh snow on the driveway; no tire tracks, no footprints, none even on the road! Your employee has done this several times. Lazy, incompetant and a liar! How proud you must be !
Canada Post Unions do nothing to their employees clear incompetence, lies and laziness. I know alot of unemployed people who would gladly do your job and with a good attitude!
You had another postal worker before who so nice, kind, competant and hard working.
Shame on you Canada Post for protecting employees like this. No wonder you have a horrible reputation and are losing market share...you brought it upon yourselves by refusing to punish the bad and reward the good.

Woe to you who call good evil and evil good!"
"I have never had a package come on time. I had a packaged being shipped from 30 minutes away (Mississauga, ON) and the day it said it was supposed to arrive the sent it to Quebec! How does that make sense. When I contacted them, they said that they didn‚Äôt have room in their facility so the send packages out. So instead of sending it to my house that‚Äôs 30 minutes away, they send it 6 hours away. What a joke"
"CP is horrendous, not sure why it takes a month to deliver something from Toronto to Edmonton. Any other company 2 maybe 3 days. My parcel sat in Calgary for a week then off to Winnipeg cuz that makes sense. sits for another week. Out for delivery, then delayed to next business day. It's Friday. .so I get to wait till Monday. F***ing tards. No standards. Just pathetic, just like our government. Shameful"
"I ordered a package of lights. The order is being shipped from Mississauga and I live in Mississauga. I order my package over a week ago and it still hasn't arrived. It has been in ""transit"" for at least 3 days, why would a package being delivered in the same city take over a week."
"I live in Germany and I'm still waiting on delivery since 23.11.I get same informations over and over saying package is on the way.For a charge of 175 Canadian dollars this is outrageous service.Dont use Canada Post,they should be fined"
"There should be an option for negative stars or at least zero. These overpaid bums should all be fired. I shop exclusively online, CP consistently is slower than EVERY other carrier. As an example orders from China arrive in Canada within 4 days of being ordered, CP then takes at least another week to get them to me. Well over 10000km in 4 days, the last 600km takes at least a week, do the math. CP you are the worst."
I have always experienced excellent service from the woman postal employee that delivers my parcels and mail in the Northumberland County/Baltimore/Cobourg area.
"0 Stars

I would post 0 stars if I could. I paid for express shipping on November 14. It is now December 4th and my ""delivery date"" has been changed 5x (first Nov. 23, Nov. 30 Dec. 1, Dec. 2, Dec 4). I understand that this is a busy time, but it makes no sense when I ordered through USPS, Purolator, and Amazon and got my stuff faster than Canada Post within days. When I called and spoke to someone I was told ""be patient"" and ""it is what it is."" Can you not just provide one delivery date and deliver on that like every other company? I've seen my package be in transit for delivery for over a week from your Mississauga location and I live in Etobicoke."
"Paid $108.00 plus tax to have mail redirected on Nov 11 2020. as of Dec 4th we find out our mail has not been redirected and no refund or answers to why. We waited 1/2 hour on the phone to find out nothing, We went to the old address to get our mail."
My package should have delivered in 3 days also I have payment for delivery but they did not even take my package from sender. Today is 3rds day. Slowest cargo company. Choose Amazon or Purolator these are more faster than CanadaPost!!!
"I had my delivery preference set to ""deliver to post office"", yet they delivered it to my Apt. WHY? I have a locked mailbox because of security concerns and it only has a slot big enough to fit thin envelopes. I had something fragile being delivered in an XpressPost cushioned envelope that I knew wouldn't fit. So on top of disregarding my delivery preference, this moronic Postman crammed my package partway into the small slot (damaging it's contents) and left it there for anyone to steal! REAL NICE Canada Post, I'm really not surprised 95% of you reviews are 1 star.."
"On Wednesday I have garbage pick up the garbage guys put the empty can infront of the mail box, some how this past Wednesday they weren't competent enough to reach over it like other Wednesdays. And left a note about how they ""couldn't reach the mail box"" I've had before them say I didnt answer the door when in reality they were to lazy to come to the door for a signature but not even attempting to get it in the mail box because of a single empty can? That's a new low."
Why take 2 day service when they are so incompetent that they take over a week to deliver....and its still not delivered has been on limbo since the 26th of Nov!
Phones then 2 different time both time the call just ended and I had to wait on hold forever again only to find out they won‚Äôt let me pick my own package up they have to deliver it. Never again will I go with Canada post UPS had no problems and they let me come get my package up if I want
Still waiting for an order. Going on a month now. Usps had NO issues! So why us canada post so bad????
"if there was an option of giving them a Zero Stars I would do that. they are so fuked up they don't even answer or respond to reviews bc they are under the wing of the government and they just there for benefits. they don't care about us. well, I hope one of their employees or head office people one day will not receive the pkg on time on critical time and learns how others feel. service sucks as our government. half-brained fuktards working there!!! end of story!!!"
"Never use Canada Post services, I mailed registered post on 4th November,2020 morning and still did not reach the destination , everytime I track it, says 3-7 business days from past month. Lost Hope's of registered mail delivery."
They are unbelievably slow and bad. They managed to lose track of a registered letter from Ottawa to an address in downtown Toronto and just shrugged their shoulders - ‚Äúdelivered to recipient‚Äôs delivery partner‚Äù a week ago who they won‚Äôt identify and ‚Äúit will arrive sometime‚Äù after already a full week of waiting. They had initially promised two working days at the post office. Three weeks to send another standard delivery item from the Toronto area to Ottawa.
"Canada post is by far the worst delivery service in Canada, if you want your package delivered weeks / months past the assigned delivery date. Or possible. It delivered at all and dropped off at the wrong address (happened to me 5 times in 3 months) Canada post you are garbage."
"So I send out a parcel via air and confirmed with the front desk personnel after waiting outside for more than half an hour and inside another half an hour. The clerk took his sweet time to do sip on his coffee, turning on the radio. I get it, he is a person too. I appreciated his service and went back home. After a few days, when I started tracking my parcel to Japan, I realized that my parcel was registered for surface service instead of air shipment. I paid for Air but now I have to wait for my parcel to be delivered not before Christmas but sometime next year. I am really pissed and tried to call the customer service. But all are automatic and does not provide me with the option to speak with customer service reps. Really really pissed. What kind of service is this? I checked even with the clerk and he said yes it is an air shipment. But yet it has been registered as a Surface shipment. And it will take not 10 days but 3 months to reach Japan. Seriously angry!"
They never drop off the mail at a decent time. Most times I don‚Äôt even get my mail. Sometimes it‚Äôs not in the correct mailbox. Parcels aren‚Äôt dropped off to the correct house and my parcels constantly go missing. For instance just yesterday and a couple weeks ago my extremely expensive parcels have gone missing. Incapable of following direct instructions. A lot of times the driver complains about the weather and decides they can‚Äôt drop off even though my rear wheel drive has no issues and there almost always driving a 4x4. People still go to work in those conditions and they should have to as well. They also do this in perfectly fine weather where it‚Äôs nice and sunny and conditions are actually very nice.
I wish I had a positive review ... Four days to go less than 300 km is not a feather in a cap anyone would want to wear ...
"these frauds wrote some number like 11509 for the amount due on my package...
and the person at office said i owed 1000$ for my 100$ package playing dumb as if thats not clearly fraud absolutely outrageous and if it was customs thats also fraud doesnt matter, but im sure it was CP seeing how shady they are apparently, why would they write a f u ck ing 5 digit number on there how ridiculous that is seems like they are running a scam to me and should be investigated in ontario candada post all the way to customs for whoever wrote that complete bull shi t oh and apparently you can do reassessment:
How do I request a reassessment ?

After refusing delivery, ask Canada Post to return the goods to the CBSA.
Canada Post will take your telephone number, provide you with a form and return your parcel to the CBSA.
The CBSA will contact you to discuss the assessment.
If the CBSA decides no duty or taxes are owed, Canada Post will deliver your parcel;
If the CBSA decides duty and taxes are owed, they must be paid when Canada Post delivers your parcel.

i asked old lady there if theres anything i can do about the ridiculous amount (post office worker at 420 veterans drive CP) and she lied to me said i couldnt dispute unless i paid for it, when clearly theres a reassessment policy, probs too lazy to fill out the forms... she always constantly gives me a hard time when i go she should be fired for being uncooperative and imcompenant

WOW get a load of this....
https: //infopost .ca /make-it-safe /canada-post-named-the-most-trusted-brand-in-canada/ (put spaces cuz cant post link)
CEO claims that canada post was named as the top most trusted company in canada, are you fu cking kidding me, look at these ratings for that same trust that is claimed false advertising to straight up lying complete fraud..."
"The rating should be 0 (zero)
DO NOT SHIP BY PROIRITY POST , IF YOU MISPLACE YOUR TRACKING NUMBER YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK !!!

A courier company can track your package by number or name , Canada post only by tracking number !! we have a 30 million $ company we will never use Canada priority post , a government origination that is unable to delivered a package how can we trust then with giving us a vaccine for the virus . WAKE UP CANADA !!!"
I wish there is 0 star. Pathetic service and always late.
"When it's a Canada Post package delivery from Amazon I already prepare myself to pick in the Post Office - It never gets delivered.
I ordered 8 items in the internet. 2 were late and/or sent to the Post Office. Both were from Canada Post, all the others arrived.
I am working from home, there's no way the delivery have not find me."
"Whenever a company ends up using Canada post I let out a groan. I already know what‚Äôs going to happen. Mind you, Canada post was like this before the pandemic as well. As soon as something hits that Mississauga station I know my package is going to be held hostage there for who knows how long."
"I have shipped 2 letters by International signed for from the UK Mid early November, both have left the UK and just stopped in Canada with a projected delivery date of the 13th February 2021....what. UK post is still being delivered on time what on earth is going on 1n Canada?"
"Why can't the carriers knock on the door and leave the package, instead of just leaving it without a knock. I waited all day for expected package, only to find it at the door the next morning. I wonder how much theft of packages would be reduced if they just knocked."
"I had an order coming from Amazon with Canada Post, due today. This morning I found a notice from Amazon that my order had been returned by ""carrier"" and I have a refund. It never even said out for delivery so did not even make it to my local post office...why???"
Never deliver on time
"Pathetic, plain and simple.

They falsify attempted deliveries and just mark it while sitting in their vehicle and leave no notice card so you have to call customer service, wait 25 minutes on hold to be provider the pick up number that isn‚Äôt available until the following day after 1pm (spoiler, it wasn‚Äôt even there after 1pm)

Then I got to pick it up and wait AN HOUR because their system ‚Äòcrashed‚Äô for them to tell me my package hasn‚Äôt made it to the post office yet...

So disgusting that these workers make so much money for doing the absolute bare minimum. I have no idea why any company would willingly associate themselves with Canada Post!!! How embarrassing"
"Will not use Canada post again. I ordered from Canada to Australia and it didn't make it past customs (product matter was 'unmailable'), although I've never had a problem ordering these exact products from the same retailer many times past. It took WEEKS for it to get to aus in the first place. Retailer then resent items with DHL and got here in less than 5 days no problems! Never again."
"Mailed a 500 gm envelope of printed matter to Edmonton from Ontario on November 19th, 2020. It was not checked out until November 23rd with an expected delivery date of November 30. Of course it is still not delivered on the 30th. They no longer have any information where it is. Cost with tax $16.77.
Amazon can deliver the package in less than a week at a fraction of the cost.
Why are Canadians paying so much for so many highly paid people to do so little?`"
"Lazy ass workers who don‚Äôt even MAKE AN ATTEMPT to deliver packages or your door! That‚Äôs what you get from unionized public labor!!!
I will go out of my way to never use Canada Post again!!!!"
most useless shipping company on the planet. packages either come extremely late or on time but just a notice. my package was out for delivery and i was home all day but never heard a doorbell but a notice was left.
Paid for express shipping. My order was 5 days late. Didn't even deliver it and just left a notice. I was at home the whole day. Didn't even knock and I had to pick it up at the post office. Cheers. Worst delivery service in Canada ever.
"Canada has been adapting to COVID 19 for 8 & 1/2 months. But not the postal service! Trackable parcels sit in limbo for days or weeks with no explanation. Delivery attempts are falsified (no delivery is attempted in reality, but records indicate delivery was attempted.) Other companies have managed to deliver large volumes in a firmly manner. Canada Post accepts payment for services that they simply do not provide. They should be making a profit from the millions of orders being shipped around the country but they have instead refused to plan and alter their operations to provide the services people are paying for. In any other business this would be a breach of contract."
F$^% YOU CANADA POST. Lazy good for nothing delivery service.
"My roommate with mobility and respiratory issues ordered a small parcel that would easily fit in our mailbox. Canada Post decided instead to leave a slip and take it back to Shopper's. I am the only person my friend can rely on for anything day to day, especially with covid, but unfortunately I don't have any valid ID (I never go to the doctor so forgot to update my health card). The lady at Shopper's immediately stonewalled me despite me calmly explaining my friend is unable to come herself and I am in fact the only person nearby able to do so. They offered no recourse and coldly and flatly stated ""no"" wjen asked if there was a possibility to redeliver. I shouldnt need to say this (but due to the existence of jerks I should), but I was polite and calm the entire time so her rudeness felt pretty unwarranted.

So thanks, Canada Post, for being unable to drop off a box the size of a waffle, and for your customer service rep having the charisma of a cracked brick."
Worst service ever take useless delays never deliver on time. Other services are far better than this. This has happened with me so many times I have experienced delays not reliable at all. I personally say please try another services rather than this ridiculous!!!!
"Inquiry - Item not delivered
Tracking Number: 8102198799887704
Ticket Number: 0138516740
Submitted: 2020/11/26

I have been experiencing very bad service provided by Canada Post for a long period of time. The simple reason for this I presume is that ""THE CANADA POST EMPLOYEES DO NOT BOTHER DOING THEIR JOBS DILIGENTLY AND HONESTLY"".

I have been expecting a parcel from China, which as per the tracking number provided, the Canada Post picked up the parcel and scanned at item at Mississauga on November 05, 2020 at 3:49 pm to be delivered to me by on November 09, 2020 between 10:30 am and 2:30 pm. Since they did not deliver it to me on the expected date, I started following it up with them but in vain. Today is November 27, 2020, and it is over 18 days of actual delivery date, when I contacted the Canada Post, they were beating around the bush and put a blame on the Pandemic for the delay. I have been receiving parcels from Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot, AliBaba and Wish kind of Chinese online vendors from overseas. But, the inland service provider Canada Post takes epoch to deliver or they don't deliver it at all."
Delay in delivery due to external factors. Delay in delivery due to external factors. Delay in delivery due to external factors. CANADA POST SUCKS!!
"Took 14 days for their 1 to 2 day shipping to send a cellphone from Toronto to Montreal, i needed it pretty urgently for business purposes, if id known 1 day shipping mean 14 days, i would have just driven to toronto to get it. On the tracking 12 of those 14 days the phone seems to have just sat in the warehouse doing nothing. Then they wonder why they are going bankrupt."
The worst service in the world. My passport was to be delivered from montreal to toronto and guess what they lost it. After waiting for 20 days I get a call from there head office saying that they have lost my passport and can‚Äôt do anything about it and they are very sorry for my loss. Canada post sucks even pakistan post is 100 times better than them.
Worst postal service in the world! I always have to pick up my packages and it will take them 8 days to deliver normal packages!
"Just plain horrible. They keep using COVID as a excuse for not getting express post anywhere close to on time. Had a package that usually only takes 2-3 days took 10 days and refused to refund yet DHL can get my package from China to me in five days even with COVID , weird how that works. On top that they keep charging the same price ."
I ordered a package that ships out of Quebec and was told it would take 7 days max to reach me as I live in Halifax. The package first shipped out of Quebec which is what it's supposed to do. Then 2 weeks after that It landed in BC then 2 days later they realized their error and it left BC and it's been 2 more days and still no updates of my package. No matter who I talk to from Canada post they keep blaming the error on Covid delays. Going to try my hardest to not use Canada Post anymore.
there was a package supposed to arrive to me 2 days ago and the sender paid to get it here quicker and the package has still not arrived these guys have the worst service in the world I much rather pay a bike messenger to bring my stuff to me these guys are ridiculous they expect you to pay extra to get it here make all these promises and then say oh we are sorry there is nothing we can do after we get the money. this is the worst service I can get this is why its easier to use dal and purolator Canada Post sucks for being such a huge company
"The delivers didn't follow the delivery instructions all the time. If there was a -5 star, I will choose it."
"I'd give them 0 stars if it was possible. I honestly could drive to get my package and drive back in the time it takes them to deliver anything. It's pathetic and I won't be using their services in the future. A country's postal service should be the backbone of the nation, not here. This is the land of lost and never delivered parcels"
Canada Post will never have your package on time. You can pay for expedited shipping and they‚Äôll delay it to make the same as regular shipping. You can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone who ever knows why you‚Äôre delayed. Every other shipping company in Canada works better than this joke for a company. If you get them handling your package DONT hold your breath on the day or week after it‚Äôs supposed to arrive. Absolute trash.
"My package was meant to arrive two weeks ago but it was stuck in Mississauga for a good while. I initially thought that because of Covid, there's a lot of people doing online shopping so they would have a heavier workload to deal with.

Fast forward, my package has been delayed twice. Now it's somewhere in Quebec. I live in Ontario. Mississauga is in Ontario. I could've just drove or even take transit to pick it up."
"MAKE THAT 2 PARCELS GONE MISSING FROM CANADA POST. DO NOT WORRY CANADA POST MY ITEMS YOU LOST, AS I WAS REFUNDED, AND ITEMS RESENT! MAYBE YOU WILL NOT LOSE WHAT WAS RESENT! AT OTHER BUSINESSES COST! I HAVE PARCELS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THEIR HANDS SINCE NOVEMBER 20 BEEN AT CARSTAIRS CANADA POSTAL OUTLET HAVE NOT BEEN DELIVERED! MAYBE ITS A PERSONAL THING SINCE MY LAST REVIEW"
"I went to Canada Post Vanderhoof to get all my parcels. I waited patiently in line. During this month til next month, there's always a long line up so I decided to get my parcels all at once to save time. Unfortunately, I was told by the staff that she can't find my other parcel and I needed to go back. She said she did not have the time to look for it because of the line up and because of the thousands of parcels at the back. I was very disappointed. I already waited in line, why not ask for assistance if she needs one. The thing is, I am reducing my time to go to different places because of Covid-19. This season is busy, they should employ more people to accommodate the long line up."
"I have had it with Canada Post. I really don‚Äôt know why they remain open. According to tracking, my package has been in my city for 5 days and has still not been delivered. They are a poor excuse for a service. Just as bad as government owned CBC who doesn‚Äôt know what the truth is. I have had it."
getting worst with tracking and when they set up investagation you never hear back from them keep getting a run around .i have had 4 parcel lost by canada post in one year they are not trust worthy
"The worst company to use for shipping parcels. They are so far behind you will never get it to you expected delivery date on time, and when they do deliver they can't even deliver to the right house have the time, their employees are lazy half of them dont even want to walk to your door to deliver the parcels, or complain to their supervisors that your steps are to big, stick with FedEx you'll be much happier"
"bad delivery guys and bad customer service so they cannot help you at all.

Delivery guys do not respect your time and wont deliver your item properly.

Then customer service cannot do anything about it.

Just a bad loop overall. VERY BAD COMPANY. VERY BAD SERVICE"
"The only reason there is a star in my rating is because it won‚Äôt allow me to leave zero stars.
Canada post is seriously lacking customer service. You can‚Äôt leave a review with Canada post itself, there is no easy way to contact customer service. The company is using covid as an excuse to really suck at doing the job they are required to do. It‚Äôs sick.
I ordered an item from ITALY this past Sunday. DHL just dropped that item off at my door in BRITISH COLUMBIA. Canada post has difficulty transferring me an item from Richmond BC over to Cranbrook BC. I‚Äôve been waiting longer for something to cross the province than it took me to shop, pick out, pay for AND RECEIVE FROM ITALY!!! C‚Äômon and get your poop in a group Canada Post"
Absolutely embarassing excuse for a postal service. This is the company we rely on during elections? How hard would it be to make Purolator the new Canadian postal service? They get my vote.
I HATE CANADA POST!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!! PACKAGES R ALWAYS LATE
"We live near Carvel, Alberta and have the best Post Lady ever!!! In the past we had problems with mail being put in the wrong rural boxes but she's been excellent, we only get our own mail now. She even recognizes us if we're at Beach Corner Store.
Thank you so much!"
"Canada post is the worse postal service, unreliable, they are hiring scammers and thieves or they can't read, to deliver people packages, I have been going through hell for the longest while almost every week all my packages has been going to other people addresses before my very eyes, while I am tracking them after receiving notification from both the seller and Canada post also my full address is on the site, call Canada post and they cannot give me any explanation for my stuff, I am tired of filing disputes to get my money back from the sellers,because they decides to steal my stuff,what a shame, thieves!!!!!!! I do not recommend (Canada post)"
They don't even attempt to deliver. They just leave a notice and now I have to go all the way to the post office in the middle of a pandemic.
"They say delivery times for internation registered mail is 5-7 days. I can understand that it could be delayed to 10 or 12 days. But now its been 20 days and i don't even know whats going on with my registered mail. Not delivered yet.
Most of the people have same complaint delayed delivery. But now they got an excuse i.e. COVID-19.
You must look into this."
"Once again, as a small business I am EXTREMELY disappointed at late deliveries when I pay for expedited. Now they say that they have suspended their postage refund program for late deliveries. How convenient for them. In the past I sent parcels from Canada to the US and the United Kingdom. Both packages were weeks late and one was lost for 2 1/2 months. Terrible service and even worse accountability."
Worst shipping company ever lost my package and didn‚Äôt compensate for anything do not use them .
"My package has been sitting at a delivery outlet since Nov 12th and says will be delivered today or tomorrow. I am not allowed to pick it up until there is an attempted delivery, this seems like a flawed system as now I am completely in the dark and unable to acquire my package. If my delivery were more time sensitive this could cause an incredible issue. Canada post needs to update this policy or make an alternative more obviously available."
always late i got my order before time in ups fedx
It is extremely difficult to contact Canada Post and sometimes the tracking will say delivered even if they still have the parcel in their vehicle. I hope they have more options on delivery preferences.
"I feel that I am in these 3rd world countries, almost lucky if I ever get the package. These ppl from CanadaPost don't care. My package cleared customs and sat there for 1 week. Then travel for 1 week to Vancouver, 2 wks later from Mississauga and still NOTHING.

So many times, I got someone else's package. Not my address, close by 1 or 2 numbers.

They don't give a crap; they don't care about their job.

Don't tell me COVID, it's an excuse for being lazy, more than ever**.**

I don't want to be prejudice, I lived in some of these countries, ppl from there messed up their system there and I feel our system is going to be just like that.."
"I live in British Columbia. My package somehow was sent ""out for delivery"" in Ontario. I don't understand how they could screw up that bad. Now I have to wait an extra week (minimum) for them to figure out their mistake and get me my package. Always very dissapointing service."
"This is in reference to my first experience with Canada Post Office, specifically on 119 Spadina Avenue. I do not know why Amazon.ca gave my shipment to CP to handle but it is the first and last time I will ever want to deal with them. The employee just flat our refused to give me my package, even though I provided my passport, credit card that I used to pay for shipment, and of course the pick-up code, sent to my e-mail. After arguing with her (and her colleague next to her who couldn't offer a solution either) she tells me that she needs proof of residency, a utility bill, phone bill or some sort of proof that I live here, but the issue is I do not live in Toronto. What does it matter if I live here or not? But she wouldn't budge, even though I provided my id and credit card, which the shipment name is under. Canada Post is pathetic and those two employees on 119 Spadina need to find another job...no job! But this seems like the standard at Canada Post. But this is not it... it took forever for the shipment to arrive."
"I dont even want to give them one star. 6 Packages in a month and paid for express post and not one is even close to on time. This last one has taken three times longer then what i paid for, should have been three day shipping max it will be day 9 if it makes it when they say it will.No refund nothing because of covid but yet they have no problem charging the same price."
"I had an order for 3 months waiting and was told I get it on November 17th.even though I live an hour away from the Mississauga location. But to add on top they had to ship my package to Winnipeg. For some God damn reason. To top that, customer service told me they knew what the mess up was said they were shipping back right away and it will come for the 17th. But of course it's almost 8pm and nothing. Thanks for the lie and stop using black Friday as an excuse when this was purchased and shipped on the 12th."
"So I am up north in Nunavut working and I fall in love with the Inuit art up here and start buying quite a lot of it. I like the stone carvings best and I start to educate myself on the prices and artist and such. I realize that I am very lucky to be able to buy directly from the artist and may be able to pay the artist better and make a few dollars myself. I discuss what my intentions were going to be with artist and tell him I am going to put it on kijji and see if they sell. First one is a 30 pound 14 inch 4 way dancing bear, it‚Äôs on kijiji a couple days and a couple from Edmonton buy it for over 2000$ and the second one I put on was bigger at 18 inches and over 50 pounds it sold a couple days after and was destined to Montreal. I have never used Canada post for any such transactions or to mail a valuable item until the one week. The first bear I boxed well and took pictures for the receiver to show I was shipping it and the post office told me about the insurance so I figured I wouldn‚Äôt need it and should be no problem but I put 1000$ on this carving, which would be appraised at about 3-3500$. The second bigger one I take and ship it 4 days after the first one and I put only 2000$ on this carving that was sold for 5200$ and figure it should be fine and thought I had found a pretty good way to make a few extra dollars and help the artist. So a day or two goes by and the couple in Edmonton contact me and send pictures before they even open the box and it‚Äôs damaged, start the insurance claim and do all they ask and they deny it for reasons they can‚Äôt back up I was told by Canada post there was no appeal process but there is and I appealed and stated reasons why I should receive my claim. The ombudsman does more investigation and comes up with I can‚Äôt show proper receipt of what I paid for it but they give me 200$ after a month and a half. The second one it makes all the scans to Montreal and then scanned out for delivery and does not make it. I call they tell me not to worry it‚Äôs busy but they are sure it will get there. After weeks of calling and asking where it is they tell me they are investigating on what has happened. The give me same thing for almost 2 months then lady from Montreal post office calls me and tells me the parcel was delivered, I ask her why it wasn‚Äôt scanned delivered and she says the battery ran out on the machine that day. I said ok then why was the signature taken from receiver like I had paid for, she says do to covid we did not do that. So I asked her why it was scanned on the 11th September at 10:55am our for delivery and then again at 1:53am on Saturday September 12th and that was computer clinch. They didn‚Äôt mind taking the insurance service you can pay for at the office but I know that they do not pay put too many claims that I am almost positive of. I asked for information on what they did for an investigation and have not got any answers, I lost a piece of art worth about 7000$ and think it was stolen by one of their own employees and they give me no reason or explanation, and after months of back and forth I think now are going to pay my insurance but I have paid the artist more money then what I insured it for and that was my stupidity but the rest is Canada Post. My money making adventure that started so good at the first turned into a nightmare quick and Canada post put me out of pocket 4000$ plus. It is almost criminal the way they can run a corporation like that."
As others have stated. Sits for days in my delivery city saying processed. Wat thee fuk Canada post!!! The only thing Canada post is consistent with is delayed deliveries. What a joke. 95% of the time I use a different and more reliable carrier. That other 5% is when I don‚Äôt have a choice.
"Package arrived on Sunday night with ‚Äú Item processed
Kelowna, BC‚Äù.

Then it sat there for 2 days. It‚Äôs Tuesday now and it still hasn‚Äôt moved from the facility. No ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù yet and the customer support is a zero, ‚ÄúI can look up your tracking to give you the most up to date update‚Äù and then rambling the cliche excuses they‚Äôre given.

How helpful, it‚Äôs as if I didn‚Äôt type in my own tracking number to see the most up to date info before wasting my time on hold.

Amazing job Canada post, way to treat an ‚Äúexpress shipped item‚Äù, just keep pushing the expected delivery date back."
"Was told that they put my package to community mailbox, but never got it nor the key to get it. It's been four days. This federal run business is a joke! The delivery workers are either unreliable or a bunch of thieves! Will never trust this company again for my parcels/items.

-Winnipeg, Manitoba"
PS5 launches Nov 12.. Mine still hasn't arrived as of Nov 16.. God know when it will arrive.
"Just horrible preorder PS5 to get on release date half the time I had no idea where my package was, then told me it‚Äôs 2 hours away and called them and they tell me it‚Äôll still
Take a week or two to get delivered two hours away? The customer rep was just rude and arrogant towards me. Avoid at all
Costs."
"I recommend to any person or company that sends or sells to Canada; to do their best to avoid Canada Post at all costs. If possible choose another delivery service. Never had those issues with UPS, Fedex or other companies.

Problems I had: Got a notification my parcels are going to arrive but no one came. Same thing for the next day. Didn't even got a note or e-mail that could tell me if it could be at a post office.
Waited another day, still nothing. Went to the local post office and asked and they didn't had anything. Where is the delivery?
Another problem I had was a parcel sent by a friend from Germany. Arrived delayed and looked like it fell from the truck. There was also a massive hole (as if someone tore out a roundish part from the box) and had some of the stuff inside missing (I knew what had should been inside, because my friend told me).

And good luck trying to contact Canada Post to get your problems solved. Unless you like wasting time and like the feeling of anger and the possibility it leads to nothing."
"Worst delivery service ever, package was sent early to make sure it comes in time and now delayed even more....marked as out for delivery and delayed to the next business day multiple time.....used to be able to pick packages up but now its not possible for some reason, package is located 10 min drive away and I have to wait for the entire weekend now when its been there for 2 days and usually supposed to come on the same day. Extremely unreliable will try to avoid this service from canada post at all cost absolutely terrible."
The worst package delivery service anywhere anytime. Customer service is even worse. Avoid at all costs.
"Canada Post completely failed. Don't trust them.
send a parcel and create a ticket that's it.
I sent my passport and of the other document months later but no updates. saying because of Covid it's delayed.
My question if it's covid how come Amazon and DHL are working.
My Ticket num 138055600.
IF YOU SENDING ANYTHING MAKE SURE TO USE PAIN KILLER FOR HEADACHE."
"Ordered a PS5 months in advance, and am being informed that it will be arriving at minimum a week late. This has happened with most if not all packages I get, Canada post is absolute garbage."
"I will start by stating the reps I dealt with are either good at what they do or just conditioned to putting up with the amount of complaints and harsh HARSH calls they must deal with on a day to day basis. I recently ordered 6 items online, 4/6 were shipped through ups and I received them the day after release. Then for reasons unknown, the two other items are being shipped through this joke of a postal office (Canada post) and they are delayed for up too a week minimum.. when I contact the service and offer to drive out to the facility and pick up my parcel personally, I was told I would be told to leave or have the police contacted to remove me. Really professional.. NEVER order anything if it‚Äôs being shipped by this joke of a company that is a disgrace to be confident enough to use Canada in its name."
"Instead of delivering a package to my door, they put a notice up in the community mailbox and made me go pick it up 20 minutes away. They could have left the package in my mailbox which was 20 metres from the community mailbox. LAZY."
Worse service ever!! I shipped something over a month ago in the same city and it‚Äôs still not there. I even escalated the matter and the manager said they would call me back because their phone line is super busy. I never got a call back. This is just the worse!
"I specifically pre-ordered a PS5 to be delivered on release day and by the way the delivery notifications are going it won't be. Worst delivery system ever. My brother ordered an Xbox and got his on release with good speed on delivery with 2 days apart.

I'd give Canada Post less than 1 star if that was possible."
Best mail service thus far. Thank you for amazing services.
"If you want something shipped across the country expect it to be there in 2-3 days, shipping something from Montreal to Ottawa though, it'll take a week maybe two ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è idk what kind of drugs they're on, but it sucks they ain't sharing"
It‚Äôs actually sad that I have to give 1 star... there really should be negative stars. Canada post is deplorable.
Worst company in Canada. People need to start a class action lawsuit i believe they actually keep your parcel if you do not pay for tracking and they only send it if you do pay for tracking because i had several parcels never delivered because i did not pay tracking. This company needs to be removed and out of business they are theives!
Canada post is constantly LATE and NEVER on the date they set for delivery. Even when its just a city away to deliver from and even BEFORE covid. Terrible service. They obviously don't care according to the thousands of negative 1 star reviews. Here's another.
"Even with the fastest of shipping it usually takes minimum of a week (for what other companies can do in 3 days). It's like it's they give the illusion of choice just to suck a couple extra bucks out of you. Not only that, but be prepared for them to delay your package over literally literally nothing. I kid you not I had a package out for delivery on a day when it was snowing maybe a foot or two of snow and my package got delayed 2 days for it."
"Ordered an item three times and each time they say they can't deliver it because of an incorrect address. Amazon got in touch with them and they said the label was ""damaged"". I know their management system is horrid so let's not go too rough on their employees who understandably want to go home early (and don't want to lift anything heavy as my package was 60 lbs)"
Worst service ever!! It must be nice to have a union so strong that you can be poor performance and never get fired! I blame more the Government of Canada for letting theses clown hold us hostage. Imagine being blind having one of those old post boxes were you don't get packages. I need to walk 2km to the post office and 2km back to pick up a package. To add insult to this my door is 25 feet to the post box. Useless service you would pay for this in restaurant why do we have to pay clowns? Time to make run like a business and get rid of these freeloaders.
"It is a shame for Canadian post to be part of the fraud in american election 2020.
I am ashamed to call myself canadian.
This is a disgrace."
"Canada Post's package delivery services is so inconsistent and slow. On the tracking service, I saw two packages were picked up on the same day in Mississauga from the same vendor. One arrived in 8 calendar days and the other one arrived in 16 calendar days. Ridiculous!!"
"I have dealt with postal services around the world, and never have I worked with a company so unwilling to help customers. Priority shipping is completely useless, as they do not refund deliveries outside of the 3 business days, and are rarely on time. I would suggest using DHL, FedEx, or carrier pigeon for a more professional and timely service."
"The worst mail delivery company/system in the world. Even India‚Äôs mail distribution process is 100 percent faster and more reliable. Canada Post falsifies their delivery standards ‚Äúpriority‚Äù isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs advertised to be. For example, a priority shipment 100 Kms from its destination took 4 days. I could have walked faster to pick it up. Don‚Äôt fall for the CP lies."
They obviously don't care and put up reasons that don't make no sense
"Parcel has been just sitting at the final post office for 2 weeks, they just are refusing to do the last leg of actually taking it to the house. Buyer got a refund and canada post fked me out of 50$. Think I'm going to start using Purolator or something, never again"
"My lord these guys are painfully slow...
Package is in Prescott to be delivered to KIngston
They send it to Ottawa, then Belleville, then KIngston???? Where is the logic in that.. I could have driven to Prescott in 45 mins..LOL"
"Canada Post has one main job to do- deliver a package to the address on the label. It's what they do! They can't even do that right. I watched them deliver my package to my neighbors house instead of mine. A different address than what was on the label, across the street from me. The label had clear instructions on it specifying which door to leave packages at, and under the carport. The house they delivered it to doesn't even have a carport! I reported it to them through proper channels online and they said they would investigate, which could take up to 5 business days. I never heard from them again and never saw my package. No accountability whatsoever and what's more, no one there could care less. Often when they do actually deliver to the right house, I get boxes that have been crushed and torn apart, and crudely taped back together. Half the time parcels get lost and then found and rerouted from who knows where. WORST DELIVERY SERVICE IN CANADA."
"If I can leave no star, I would. Service is slow at the post office. Incorrect information given and when calling their customer service is totally a joke. All agents give you different and wrong information. Why do they still exist? Worst postal service ever!!!!
Trying to get a refund for false information given to send a non-mailable item that was returned was even a bigger joke. Everyone tells me different thing and was rude to me. Will use other mailing service instead, rather pay more than getting false information and rude services. It‚Äôs not about not able to get a refund but the frustration of getting wrong information and it‚Äôs not the first time and I can guarantee it won‚Äôt be the last either. Thanks for nothing, Canada Post!"
"If you want your package to arrive real late, I mean real late send it threw the what a bunch of #$$#%$$"
Horrible service. We are rural and have had issues the last 6 months. This week we have received mail Monday and Friday. Poor customer service. Rude response from post office. Overall not a good review.
The worst mail service i‚Äôve ever seen in a first world country. Its so pathetic its almost funny. But its not.
"Ordered on Saturday night. They took my money and confirmed my delivery by Sunday evening.

It is being shipped locally less then 4 hours away from me. Been a week now. And still hasnt updated on the website. It went from Abbotsford. To Richmond. It oiginated from Richmond.


Now I can order marijuana online. And have it delivered in less then 24 hours. Free.

Lol garbage company is beyond garbage. 1 star explains it all. Imagine trying to defend this company with anything more than a 1 star review. 95% of folks arent as dense as them. Thank god."
"Canada post has to be the worst for customer service. Not only can they not adhere to their xpress post service they repeatedly emailed me to be home to sign then didnt show up. They came the nxt morning and kno1 was home and now i have to wait till after the weekend for my package. When i got in contact with them they literally told me ""to bad theres nothing tht can be done"" after telling them whats inside the package is for medical reasons they told me ""go spend the weekend at the hospital then"" using the pandemic as an excuse to justify the terrible service... and on top of all that they didnt even try and go to my door.. the notice was left on the front door of my building. The lazyness is disgusting. Canada post needs to shut down and let the companies who actually provide the service they sell do their jobs!! Fk canada post and the over paid workers.. zero consideration for the customer"
"Canada Post NEVER delivers to my door like they are supposed to and paid to do. All my deliveries end up with a door knocker notice in the community mailbox which proves they haven't even come to my door otherwise they would have left it hanging on 'The Door Knob'. Then I have to go pick up my parcel at Shoppers Drug Mart where they do drop off and pick-ups. The people who work there also complain about how the delivery guys don't deliver the packages and overwhelm them with all the deliveries for them to deal with. They have givin me the 1 800 number many times to call and complain and I am told that it won't happen again but the very next parcel shipped with them, you got i, same scenario again. These are the laziest pieces of garbage that work for Canada Post and I agree with the other 95% of the reviews they should just shut down and get off our roads cause their service isn't worth it. Amazon, DHL, UPS, and Fed-Ex are all far Superior. Not to mention deliveries are never on time and all this was the same before COVID-19 so that is no excuse either. Incompetence on a whole new level."
"saskatoon SASK - residential - over past 3 years I have complained to can post about mail delivery (specialists) WALKING on residents lawns - NOTHING CHANGES -OCT 29 2020,, caught the "" glorified monkey "" walking on our lawns AGAIN-- WASTE of TIME COMPLAINING because Im ""thinking"" that canada post employees are UNTRAINABLE --- MAYBE robots OR monkeys as replacements"
"Have read the negative reviews and the positive ones. I've never had any issues with receiving a parcel from Canada Post. I've ordered items from Amazon.ca, Etsy.com, Walmart Canada, and ebay Canada. My parcels arrived to my home in a timely manner. And a couple of my parcels got to my home ahead of time. Perhaps, it's the city where you live in. And remember that we are in a pandemic situation and all postal services are backed up with sorting of packages and getting them out to their customers. I got a package in September from the States and it was delivered to me ahead of schedule to my address in Canada and via Canada Post. I've also spoken with agents at Canada Post regarding a USPS First International Parcel Mail Service regarding the time it would be arriving to my home. I bought the item from a seller on ebay Canada from the States. It was mailed out on the 23rd of October and has already cleared customs and I will be getting it tomorrow on October 30th! 7 days! :) I am very, very impressed and very, very happy. :D My Canada Post postal carriers always deliver my packages to my door. I live in Owen Sound Ontario. I've also sent packages via Xpress Post and my oldest nephew in Ottawa got it in 3 days from the date that I sent the parcel and this was in the first week of October 2020. Every company including UPS is not perfect and there are problems. But, let's be fair to them. Delays are to be expected during Covid-19 and even the days without the pandemic, human errors do happen and let's not forget computer error too. In my honest opinion Canada Postal workers work very hard at their jobs and are now even working on weekends to get the parcels out to relieve the backlog. A friend of mine in Toronto got a parcel from Canada Post on a Sunday. This was on October 11th. He also very pleased. :) I just got my parcel from ebay Canada from a seller in United States. Way ahead of schedule! From Florida in the United States via USPS First International Parcel Mail Service. Sent out on October 23rd and I got my Boyds The Wizard of Oz ""Dorothy"" Bear with ""Toto"" to add to my The Wizard of Oz collection. I just opened my parcel a few minutes ago when I went to look in my mailbox and my parcel was there. Very, very happy! :-D WELL DONE CANADA POST! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ ‚òÜ"
"Every single time it's canada post there's a problem, UPS and fedex always delivers with no address problems. I always put unit # on second line and seems Canada post didn't care to include that on the label so it gets returned to sender. They don't contact you if a delivery is missed nor do they try to knock or any type of notice. It's near impossible to be able to talk to an actual human online or on their phone. Worthless company it should be dissolved."
"I paid USD70 for Xpresspost International
Item shipped 14 October 2020 and untill now (29/10/2020), my parcel hasn't reached my country.

I contacted via Twitter and these are their replies
Which is obvious, unkind and inconsiderate:

Hi there. We haven‚Äôt received any update for this item. As of October 15th, the item has been forward to the destination country. We suggest allowing time for its arrival and time for its clearance. We rely on local postal services to share tracking information. We will update the delivery information when it becomes available. We suggest that you continue to track the items online to get the latest update. Thanks.
Oct. 15 International item being forwarded to destination country Richmond, BC


Your tracking number shows delivery in 4 to 12 business days. Your shipment is on its way.

I'll never choose Can Post
Don't offer Xpresspost international services if you can't fulfill it"
"Why would anyone use Canada Post? Amazon has set the bar and Canada Post isn‚Äôt even close to being competitive. Tomorrow I‚Äôve got a scheduled delivery of a time sensitive item. Knowing that I wouldn‚Äôt be home, I contacted Canada Post to try to make arrangements to have my wife accept the package in my place, thinking that I had to show ID and sign off on the parcel. Their response was, ‚Äúas long as she has ID that confirms the same residential address as mine, there won‚Äôt be a problem.‚Äù Great! Problem avoided. But then the CP rep stated that my wife would receive the parcel ‚Äúcard‚Äù and would then need to go collect the item at the Post Office. Wait, what!? Whether I‚Äôm there or not, there would be a card left and I would still need to go collect the parcel. So what‚Äôs the advantage having my wife wait for the CP delivery? The customer service rep then stated, ""Don't stress, you can usually get the parcel later tomorrow."" I had to laugh! Of the few hundred parcels I've received via Canada Post, every time the pickup date was the next day! Or on the Monday if the card was left on a Friday! Never was the parcel ready for pickup the same day! Again, this is a time sensitive item and needs to be in my hands before the end of day tomorrow. The CP customer service rep tried to explain. Due to Covid, CP drivers are not collecting signatures for the parcel but only the card. Wait! Even with Covid, Amazon, Fedex and UPS give you the package, while keeping social distancing norms. This is service! Canada Post could do the same and still protect their employees. Canada Post is running their business like we are in the 1980s.
Horribly archaic service! We need to boycott Canada Post. They need to be out of the service business so that companies won't have the option to use this pathetic company. I will gladly pay more for service to my door. Get it right or get out of the game!!"
"experience has never been bad, and when my parcels were missing, they were found in a matter of one business day."
"I live in a neighborhood that has a speed limit of 15 kilometers per hour. I have observed the Canada Post delivery driver nearly every day going much faster than 15.
I would say they drive nearly 40 kilometers per hour and going over the speed bump in front of my home so fas the vehicle comes down with a very loud bang"
"Paid for 3 day express delivery with insurance and signature required. BC to Alberta. Took 3 weeks, was told conflicting stories by CP. One agent says it is being held since Oct 16th, but can't say why or where. The 2nd supervisor actually called and said it was delivered to the door of my previous address and accepted by a teenager. After getting police and my previous landlord involved. I found there was no deliveries on the 16th as confirmed by surveillance reviews. Was denied the insurance based on the old address and their assurance that it had been delivered. Although tracking still says its being held since oct 16th. My landlord checked the mailbox and found it in there. So much for CPs story about it absolutely being delivered to the door. All BS because they didn't provide the service paid for. How does it get signed for when they toss it in the mailbox? Too lazy to walk up a flight of stairs or buzz the apartment to fulfill their obligations. Just a pathetic display from Canada Post!"
"Speedy service.
Very happy.
Great job Canada Post üëåüèª"
Post office clerks tell you one thing and the canada post refund people tell you another. If its 2 day delivery guaranteed plan for 3!!! Even 4!!
Every time I see a package coming via Canada post I realize this package won‚Äôt arrive for 2-3 months. They are soooo slow it‚Äôs pathetic
Worst company ever.......useless lazy and rude. Item comes from overseas and opposite from all other shipping companies that send you a duties owed notice when item enters Canada and you have time to pay before delivery.......canada post don't even drops a card to go pick at the post office and pay there all same day. If i wanted to go to the post office and contracted Covid-19 i would have choose that option!!!! i paid for delivery.
"I contacted them about arranging for a parcel to be sent to a pick up location but all I got was ""Unfortunately we are unable to intervene"". One of my parcels hasn't even made it to Canada yet and the other is still at the sorting facility but I still got the same reply. Parcels aren't able to be forwarded so I'm basically screwed. I didn't get any suggestions for what to do. Thanks for nothing."
I don‚Äôt wanna give even a single star for your service. I never get my parcel delivered to my address. They never call to ask if i am home or not. They just put their piece of paper on my mail box and ask to pick it up from their location. Such a lazy staff and super annoying service.
"My package used to take 2 hours to go through Sudbury... Last bunch has been 3-6+ days and still not moving. Got there fast, and no updates about delays in Sudbury. Terrible system they have. I think a monkey can run it."
"Please Canada Post, change your name to Garbage Post or Blackhole Post or something. That's more accurate to reflect your service. Don't use the word Canada, you don't deserve it."
"I am considering cancelling my Amazon account, as I thought it would be better for me to order from them as I work from home. However anytime they have to sub Canada post as a shipper. They always send me a notice that Canada Post tried to deliver but no one was home which is total BS. I also caught the driver once delivering a package to my neighbour which was mine and I needed it that afternoon. I asked her if it was for my address and she did not look at the paperwork just the green address sign and said no it is for them. It was for my address and I didn't end up getting that package until later on that week. Canada post is a prime example of how when a government runs something it is horrible service and not what we should get from paying such high taxes in Canada, just like our health care system in which I have been waiting for just a call to arrange an appointment with a specialist for 5 months now. Close CANADA POST."
Canada post always make me angry based on the lazy behaviour in work of their delivery staff. I can't not imagine I am living in a developed country.
"Please keep 'zero' stars available. A letter sized envelope was sent from BC to Ont and I received it 2 weeks later. I made an order from BestBuy on Oct 15th (Quebec) and received the package Oct 21st. Six days, unbelievable.
I spoke on phone to a BBQ company in the U.S on the 19th at 12:30 pm regarding a defective part. I received the part on the 21st at noon. This package came from Colorado and it took TWO days using UPS. TWO DAYS !!!!
Keep away from Canada Post"
Registered Mail with Rate Code 206 is supposed to be AIR MAIL and its been 30 days I am waiting for my Passport Mail. The rep at Store miscommunicated that it will be delivered in 3-7 days And it says same on their website tracking page. Reached out to Ombudsman and proceeding with Legal action now. Enough is Enough! Someone must take responsibility for such awful service and inability to do their job.
"A over a $2000 dollars package üì¶ from bell Mobility is gone a package that I never received, I was expecting a package from Canada post On October 19, 2020, it‚Äôs says online tracking number that my package has been delivered which I never received my package, I seen the mailman the next day on October 20th,2020 where‚Äôs my package he said I left your package on the floor mail room floor that‚Äôs what where doing leaving peoples packages on the floor with out a signature and no left notices cards I never received a notices card in my mail box, it says online signature required, just because COVID-19 go leave peoples packages left on the floor mail room floor, I reported to Bell Canada about this matter and I called Canada post too where my package it does says online tracking number that your package has been delivered I told Canada post I never received my package since October 19,2020 I told Canada post I reported to bell Mobility the sender Canada post lady kept saying I‚Äôm so sorry üòî what happened to my package that‚Äôs not save just go leave my package on the floor mail room so anyone can go take packages I live in a apartment building it‚Äôs in a investigation here I‚Äôm so upset here I‚Äôm crying üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ my address is 180 bold street apartment 1502.

Best service. Received my camera one day prior
"if there is 0 start i will give to the awful service, imagine you call to know whee is your item that you paid for and someone who work there tells you exactly we have no idea and there is no much we can do you have to wait what the..."
"They are not even trying anymore. Package said ""Out for delivery"" at 7:46am, and then ""Attempted Delivery"" at 7:47am... They now are saying I must go pick it up from the post office. I don't have a car and the package is large to carry. This happens everytime I am expecting packages shipped via Canada Post."
"Terrible. I paid for delivery because I have just had surgery and have mobility issues (both my wrist and my leg are in a cast). I didn't think delivery would be a problem because I knew I would be home and we have a giant Canada Post mailbox in our lobby. This was a package containing something I need medically. Instead of delivering it, they put a delivery notice in my mailbox. I have absolutely no idea how I will get it now."
"Item said delivered, left in parcel locker but there's no key in my mail slot. Told 3 days for investigation when its urgent medication thats in there. Maybe pay your workers more so they are more likely to perform the job, how hard is it to put a key in a mail slot?"
"Horrible! I ordered a phone online and they stuck it in someone else's mail box, now I need to do a stolen report and order a new phone. They don't even care! It's apparently not their problem and it's my phone companies problem even though Canada post was the one that funked it up."
"Absolutely pathetic, package has sat in transit in one place no updates for 4 days now , made it over half the trip in first 6 hours of delivery and has sat almost 5 days not moving"
"They deserve 0 stars. I never been so mad for a long time until today due to their delivery service. The guy was too lazy to push the ring bell properly and returned with the item. Now, I have to collect the heavy item from the post office. I paid for the delivery to avoid collecting it at the post office. They are not just lazy but stupid. Amazon delivered so many items , and always smooth and easy. But, post-canada has really to make some efforts."
If I could give them zero star I would . Horrible service if you want your stuff lost get canada post to deliver it ... never again ...
"It is incredible that we still use Canada Post, most unreliable and inconsistent service out there. I've actually declined purchases because the vendor uses Canada Post as the only delivery option."
"Blames everything on something else but their own service. Covid, traffic, weather, etc. No idea where my package is. Government subsidies continue and we suffer. Defund this dinasaur of a company and let others just take over. With email and alternative package deliveries, just let this thing die already.

Update, spoke with delivery person who will not knock or ring the door bell because of covid, so signature required package will not get delivered. So F&^k up. WEAR A GLOVE and do your job properly."
"You would think that they try their best to have your international parcel delivered as soon as it leaves their Richmond hub in BC, only to make a mistake and deliver it to another sorting facility which is like 2 to 3 cities away from the intended local facility. Incompetent if you ask me. So sad.

Update: So after a full day of no movement in the status, i exchanged messages with an online rep. All they can say is that they feel sorry. They said that i should contact the sender and have them initiate a claim. WHY would i do that when the delay was obviously YOUR fault Canada Post?!?!?!?!? I was told that it was part of the service that Thai Post provides. Sure....have somebody else clean up your mess. So near and yet soooooo far.......seriously a pathetic waste of money."
"do not pay extra for tracking as the lazy workers do not scan ur item.when it reaches different destinations/citys,have recieved multiple items that were broken and or dented,horrible customer service there lucky there the only real mail service in canada or im sure theyd be out of buisness.terrible attitudes aswell"
"Terrible always delayed for no good reason as far as I am concerned, no company should use them as means of shipping valuable items!"
I would like to ask where is my parcel ? I sent from Europe two months ago and still not delivered !
Tried to use Canada Post for my small home based business but the site is difficult to maneuver and there is NO customer service. They false advertise on their web page - saying there is Free shipping for small business accounts on Tuesdays in October - lol - if you ever get it to work. I finally had to go to the post office and there were 2 other customers there asking the same questions - why the small business Tuesday they are advertising online does not work? The workers had no idea what any of us were talking about. Then they said they can't give us the same rates. Back to UPS and Fedex for me until Canada Post gets their act together.
"Talk about convenient! Logged in, created a label, paid and printed, drop off to my closest CP outlet. Compared to Purolator who gave me inaccurate info on the phone so I wasted my entire lunch hour."
they do not even try even till they get paid more have more benefits then the competition they don't give a crap about how important that package is too you or your mail ... that type of attitude corrupted the whole system and now it needs too be shut down and privatize its a waste of tax payers money
Very service we got made fools of and were told our order would arrive today but it didn't and I recommend some private company we lost $800 in airplane tickets. Never i see garbage service like this canada post is very dirty service now i changed my ticket and pay$375 panelty than I make to call Canada post and ask them how is responsible they said sorry we can't do nothing.
I lost 400$ because they didn't take a signature and just randomly drop the item in the middle of my appartment complex. The delivery time is also extremely slow. I have only two words: Useless and incompetent.
"""On the way, but it may be late
Your parcel can still arrive 16 October
We're working to get your package back on track. Please check back later for more delivery info from Canada Post.
Was expected 16 October"" This seems to be par for the course lately. Amazon....flex your muscles!!"
"My mother recently sent me 2 packages for my birthday. One was an express package that was supposed to arrive the next day. It did arrive to Edmonton (where I am), then for some reason the driver couldn't find my office for days. The tracking kept saying 'delivered' then 'held till next day' and 'business closed' (it wasn't).

My mom had to contact them when they said they left a pick-up card (they didn't), so they gave her the # of the card and the post office reluctantly gave it to me. The package contained food that was just a lump of mould by then. The issue was that she didn't write the unit # on the package, but the business name WHICH IS JUST AS VISIBLE AS A UNIT #, was on it. They didn't even try. My phone # was also on it, but nobody bothered to call.

The second package was regular speed, and had THE EXACT CORRECT ADDRESS ON IT, and went through the exact same issues. They didn't even try once to deliver it. My mom paid lots of money for the shipping and this was just a horrible experience.

Get it together Canada Post. Seriously."
"I sent my boxes days before I relocated in Halifax in the hope that while I‚Äôm in isolation my boxes will arrive in my place. But alas Canada post disappoints me. Not only did they hold the deliver of my two boxes for days, they also decided that all my boxes should be picked up in the shoppers drugmart. Which is ridiculous because I already called their support and told them that I am in isolation and doesn‚Äôt own a car because I just relocated in Halifax. I even told them that I need my boxes delivered this week because all my formal clothes plus my work clothes are inside those boxes. This is very disappointing service."
"The have lost my passport and they refuse to give me a declaration about it so that I can apply for reissuing my passport. All they say is just to wait. It's been 2 months, still nothing..."
"Yet again Canada Post has failed to deliver my Express parcel but said they did.
Online it says attempted delivery and a card was left, neither happened. I was home waiting. I had to call Canada post to get a pick up number for the postal
outlet, I hope it will be there. This is not the first time this has
happened. I have had neighbors delivering my parcels to me because it
was dropped off at their address. They are getting worse but uses Covid for all their excuses. I'm sick of it."
"Xpress post speed in Canada Oct 1 item scanned in BC Richmond, Oct8 scanned in BC Richmond, Nice, Thank you I believe this is not service but a joke. Honest review I come from India our postmen deliver 2nd largest populated country with massive traffic ON A BICYCLE and speed post in India says less then 5 days and done before 5 days. Cannot deny the fact that your scanning crew is so lazy they barely scan items maybe 1 out of 10 order is scanned properly on move. 1 old postman with a cycle in a very busy country does 10 time better job. to improve start with scanning your items and than focus on responsible deliveries. feels like teenagers are working in ca post."
"horrible , worst postal system in the world"
"Absolutely pathetic. Was there ever a time when Canada Post was reliable?
Can't wait for their yearly strike to demand more for doing a terrible job!"
Absolutely incompetent service. The website told me this morning that a notice was left at my door and there wasn‚Äôt and it said it was at my local post office and I had to wait around for an hour before the office opened only to be told that the package wasn‚Äôt there and that it was out for delivery and I missed it and a notice was left and there was no notice. Absolutely last time I‚Äôll ever do business with them ever again. Total disgrace for a national postal service.
"Canada post is terrible. The employees at the desk are kind and helpful to a degree.. nothing against them. The company itself, has horrible customer service. Their website and business centre is a disaster. They are unhelpful. Every time I needed to report an issue or get help there had be 0 resolution. I am a e-commerce business owner, I send lots of packages weekly... one of my customers received there package completely ripped open with permanent marker all over and the items broken. Who other than Canada post would have done this? The item is irreplaceable and super expensive. I do write FRAGILE on every box I send out. Canada post compensated me
$9............. what the hell am I supposed to do with $9. Your employees are responsible
For this damage and it‚Äôs not the last time this has happened.

Whenever I need help with my personal business account I wait on hold for 25 minutes to find out you literally can‚Äôt help
me at all.. and i can‚Äôt help myself cuz your website sucks.

Why even have a website, a call centre or a business at all? Get it together."
"If there‚Äôs a 0, I‚Äôd give them even less. Everyone does contact delivery except for Canada Post.
I filed a complaint that was unresolved about the mailman REFUSING OVER AND OVER AGAIN to leave my delivery in front of my suite door in a secured building where I buzz him in for access. In times of COVID, deliveries are contactless except for Canada Post. My health is not the best and Canada Post is forcing me to compromise my health by not providing a contactless delivery system. I have left clear directions on my address info of where to leave my deliveries. Why is this postman REFUSING to follow directions?! I have Chefs Plate deliver to my suite door every week. Amazon, UPS, FEDEX other food delivery services have contactless deliveries. It‚Äôs a SHAME Canada Post is not considering the health and safety of their customers! What a disgrace to Canada!"
Shame on you for not ringing even attempting to ring my buzzer when I was home all day and to get an email saying a delivery was ‚Äúattempted‚Äù. Called customer service today and the guy said that this is the protocol due to Covid. Umm...to not even attempt to ring a buzzer and just leave a delivery notice and then sending an email saying an attempt was made. Complete bs.
"Awful experience. Everything I order comes in either broken or bent. Also, $60 in extra hidden fees."
can these morons be replaced with drones already? they absolutely suck and they need to listen better. Why in 2020 do we not have the option to choose who delivers our mail and packages? Canada post should have been out of business a long time ago. get with the times
it doesn't work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ordered a bag from walmart canada post told me it would be delivered two weeks ago and still isn‚Äôt here haven‚Äôt heard from them since even after emailing
"Canada Post should have some some decency and tell the customers they just don't know how to mail internationally. I sent a package using their service and AFTER 25 DAYS, the package HASN'T ARRIVED YET. I repeated the process but now using DHL services and the package arrived in ONE SINGLE day."
"Worst experience ever. Unhelpful and unreliable. Not able help just excuses.
Two weeks from Vancouver to Victoria. Shameful service"
Candad post tracking delivered my package already OPENED and thrown into my mail cubby staining the shirt that was sent. Horrible service!!!!!!!!!! Fed Ex or Purolator ALL the way!!!! They'll deliver your packages unopened at least!!!
"Canada post will only deliver packages that fit in the small mailboxes of my building, any packages that are bigger have to be picked up at a post office. I have mobility issues and cannot go to the post office, so consequently I am screwed."
"One star is too much for Canada Post! Two Registered Letters that we sent mid August had not been delivered by late September and were ""investigated"". There was no response for the investigation on one of the letters; COVID was blamed for the delay on the second letter, though no one could even tell where the letter was. (Everyone else seems to be working during COVID.) One service ticket said they expected to resolve the matter by December! Unacceptable Canada Post!

If you have important documents, pay the extra for a courier and save yourself a lot of time and headaches!"
"Looks like Canada post is worse business in the whole industry
And the solution to fix any problems is to send you back to the sender with some worthless number.. What is missing still missing who gives a....
Dissatisfied
Disaster...
Where is my parcel where is my money
Who is responsible
O wait.... No one...
Crap
Just look at this rating OMG
JOKE NOT A BUSINESS"
Lost my package guys... not even one apology. Avoid this service.
"Ordered a Large Dog bed off of Instagram, First Mistake! Watching the Tracking Number Slowly moving from China. Finally Arrives in Toronto. Two weeks later it arrives to Post office and Says it's out for Delivery! At the end of Day it Says Delivered to community Mail Box! There's No Way this Package will fit in a Mail Box! Of Course I Check my Mail and it's Not there. So I guess that's That. Another Successful delivery. Thanks Canada Post for not Giving S#@t about your Customers and Doing Nothing to Find my Lost Package. You Suck!!!!"
"Canada Post is the absolute worst. Here is my tracking number for you canada post union workers. PG538883114CA. Paid extra to have my items shipped from Montreal to Kitchener. No far right? Regular post is generally 4 business days. But on the fifth business day Friday night my parcel had not arrived after being scanned in Kitchener on the Wednesday of the third business day. Called the call centre and of course the agent was of ZERO help. No information, no help. "" Oh i can enter a ticket"" Useless. How about you refund me for the poorest carrier service in Canada. I am embarassed that people paid so much money to handle mail, can not provide service like UPS or FEDEX. This review is probably just a waste of time because what can you really do with lazy union workers. Maybe use UPS so Canadapost has to lay off all of their workers.

Tyler
905-299-8899"
We tried sending a letter express post from Guelph to Ottawa. 10 days later the tracking still says verifying address. We call the 1-800 and they say they cannot find the address. They also say they didn't have our contact info to check with us (after confirming our tel and email to ensure our correct identity!!!!). Then we corrected the address over the phone - which was about 10 doors down the street from the original address. They said it would be delivered within 5 business days. 4 days later we got it back with an extra charge of $15 for return delivery. So we paid twice and it is still in our hands after 15 days crossing Southern Ontario.
"Unfortunately even if there is 1,000,000 negative reviews, no change will happen ever.
Ticket for delay or no ticket, clients will ALWAYS continue to have delays on a good day."
"Canada post is the worst delivery company on planet earth. Their employees, from my experience, are unwilling to go off script, and have this strange arrogant entitlement that must come from decades of incompetency due to public subsidization and zero accountability. We must all do our part to use other modes of shipping, and insist that our vendors do the same. In my 53 years of life, I cannot think of a single incident where a Canada Post employee went ""above and beyond"" or provided exceptional customer service. Example: today I called them because a xpresspost signature item was signed ""COVID"" by the letter carrier and delivered to the wrong address. The CSR kept saying ""it shows as delivered sir"" Good God. So she got a diatribe from me. I wish I had an old school rotary phone so I could have slammed the receiver down. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
"3 weeks for a LETTER to travel 25km across the city? Canada Post is Abysmal.
I only receive mail delivery maybe 2-3 times a week. Most days of the week I never see the postal carrier, nor have anything in my mailbox.
And parcels? Forget about it. Even with Express Post (1-2 day delivery) takes a WEEK minimum.
They were terrible pre-covid, but now they have an excuse to really be lazy overpaid sh#ts!"
"Customer service is AWEFUL.
It was and old cracky B**** I got put on the phone with. No help what so ever and RUDE!
I ship 20 parcels A day with them. losing my business 100%!"
Yay!!! fast shipping from outside (seller's country) then parcel goes in Canada and it takes 2-3weeks or MORE to REVIEW? HOW LONG DO YOU GUYS NEED TO REVIEW A PIECE OF DOLL? RICHMOND REVIEWING SINCE SEPT 1!!! NOW IT'S SEPT 24 AND THE BIRTHDAY HAS PASSED! WELL. THANK YOU. FOR NOTHING. POOR BDAY GIRL. AND WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT/DISAPPOINTMENT NOT HAVING A GIFT PROMISED TO A LITTLE GIRL. Covid. Weather. Smoke. What else??? Just close down if you don't want to send our mails. Then a more responsible courier could step in and actually deliver our packages!!!!!
"Expedited packages consistently late. Terrible tracking.
Packages from overseas take 5-10 days to reach Canada. Then they disappear into the Canada Post system for ten weeks (my most recent memorable experience).
Covid has turned into their latest excuse for terrible delivery times. Fed-Ex and DHL Packages have Consistently been arriving one or two days before their expected delivery dates.
Why does Canada Post continue to survive?"
"Poor services
My stuff is shown as delivered but I did not get it."
"I had very bad experience with canada post. I have sent 3 packages and i received 2 packages of them and they dropped it in the lobby , not even in the safe lock door, so any one can grab that. I lost my 3rd package which was 25kg and they said its delivered but i didn't receive it and they dont even call or give a ticket taht they delivered the package. I never use it again."
they never want to deliver to my door they just stick a notice card im my mailbox and i always have to go to the post office to get my packages.
do not send anything of value with them. They lost my parcel.
"Canada post lost my parcel arrived from France, and doesn't allow me to file a complaint, because it is international. The tracking clearly stats the parcel was in transit from Richmond BC for over a week...which only takes a day to arrive, so this is obviously lost. The tracking is the following LG025736357FR , and I paid over $80 with shiping

I understand there are delays but to not have sny communication or trace for it,it is unacceptable and means my parcel is lost, stucked on a boat, delivery van or simply stolen, and Canada Post allows it with no care!! Canada post cut all comunication with customers by any means...and washes it hands with it incompetence. Also no tickets are allowed to be filed on international parcel who are lost by them, in Canada.
This is unacceptable and should never be allowed, and they should trace the parcel or refunded to me .

I have lost over 3 hundreds in parcels lost by canada post and refused to do anything because I could not contact the sender, or they pocket the money and never contacted back...and despite the fact I paid for that , abx was able to prove it, they wash their hands and stole my money. Other time I got something on kijiji and was lost in the mail aldo from Richnond, and canada post refunded the sender and they never contacted me, so I lost the parcel and the money while sender gain it both tganks to stupid polucied of Canada post who allow theft. Shouldn't be allowed!! in 99% reciever is the one who pays for it, not the sender...so you incourage, and allow thefts.

Regulation should be in place that if sender can't be contacted the reciever, or if they can proove they paid for the item online, should get the refund, or something to keep us safe!

You are a joke Canada post and better give me the parcel or a full value refund!!

I stilk wabt yovtrudt tgat you are going to refund me or bring my stupid gift bag parcel with a FREE shipping coupon appologies!!"
tells me its out for delivery. never shows up. and tells me to pick it up with a notice. never got that notice. just lost an expensive item because of these guys.
Terrible service. Can‚Äôt believe this company is still around. Just had a driver tell me he can‚Äôt let me buzz him up and drop off my parcel ‚Äúbecause Canada post isn‚Äôt a billion dollar company‚Äù. Laughable excuse for terrible customer service that still thinks it‚Äôs 1999...
"Paying for express means nothing with this company.
They haven't delivered my package on time even when the destination is 10 hours away by drive. it must be one of the poorest service provider, there are company's that provide coast to coast overnight services, but this is just pathetic"
Ordered Some legal cannabis from a legal distributor run by the Government of Alberta. 14 days latter was told it was sent to a secure facility cause it smells of cannnabis and will be disposed of. now waiting over a month for a refund.......
"I received email from Canada Post informing the delivery attempt and letter left at the door @8:00 AM. I was at Home at that time and didn‚Äôt hear bell ring. There was not letter or notice left - I looked everywhere, even searched My front yard thinking it may be blown away by wind - NOTHING. I‚Äôm having strong suspicion that no one came at all. Had to call in, wait for a hour to get the pickup number. What a scam!!!"
"recently made 4 online ebay purchases...i live in an apartment building but despite that the first one arrived from australia without a hitch and in 13 days and was deposited in my keyed mailbox where it is supposed to go...the next 2 arrived together(also from australia)and for some inexplicable reason canada post attempted delivery and as i was not at home decided to return them both to sender...no pick up notice telling me to pick it up at the post office...just straight back to australia...and the most aggravating thing about that is in calling up customer service they themselves have NO IDEA as to the reason why...i have to wait for the sender to HOPEFULLY receive the return and it may be marked on the parcel why it was returned instead of being held for pickup which i thought would have been standard practice...the fourth and final parcel was shipped on august 6 and showed absolutely no movement on both the canada post and australia post website as of september 7 which was the last time that i checked on it...i check again 2 days later and tracking all of a sudden shows DELIVERED ON AUGUST 26 even though when i checked on september 7 there were still no scans...Hellooooo???...Calling Elvis...anybody there??...and this time instead of being delivered into my mailbox it was apparently left unattended by my door(or MORE LIKELY on the ground beneath the mailbox as the door to enter the building is locked)...and when i call up canada post to inquire why a parcel that i never received should be marked as DELIVERED i was promptly told that canada post policy allows for the mail person to just drop the item unattended at the entrance to an apartment building, regardless of the parcels' value...i guess they are hoping that everyone in the vicinity is going on the honour system and won't touch a parcel not addressed to them...what a bunch of morons...i now understand why another site that used to have them as a delivery option now ships exclusively UPS...2 purchases made on that site and shipped UPS went smoothly without an issue because UPS understands the usefulness of the pick up notice for any potential customer that actually has a job and can't stay home all day waiting for an inept postman...be a cold day in hell when i trust my business to these incompetents again"
"Website is glichy
very difficult to find any information
extremely long wait times when calling in.
overall just a terrible experience"
By far the worst company I‚Äôve ever encountered.
"Worst POS ever. routinely I get packages over nighted from about 3 hours away about twice a month. in 2/3 of the cases the package arrives next day normally. however 1/3 the time it takes a WEEK! a WEEK to get 3 hours away. Absolutely insane. Customer service is nonexistent, I've sent an hour on hold today only to be hung up on by the person that answered finally."
"Canada Post must be the worst delivery service on the planet. They never deliver on time as promised on their tracking site. Their tracking site is absolutely useless. My Amazon parcel is sitting in my town since Monday and still no delivery by Thursday. Now they announced no delivery in the Okanagan, BC, because of smoke?!? Kids are going to school, stores are open and people are working. Even the sun is shining here. What's wrong with CP? Even in the past with perfect conditions they never delivered on time. No wonder they are running a loss year after year. If I could I would give them minus 5 Stars.
T. M."
"My delivery was delayed by 5 day and today they update their site saying
""Delivery may be delayed due to extreme weather conditions Richmond, BC""

You know what are the extreme weather condition smoke from wild fire...fu ...kids are going to school normal ..everything is working normal.. wat is wrong with u"
ALWAYS DELAYING. FAT LAZY DELIVERY DRIVERS DONT CARE AB CUSTOMERS. üòêüòê STOP USING CP
Absolutely horrible. I searched so hard for info that ‚Äúis Canada post losing money‚Äù came up as popular search item. Turns out they lose about 100million a year. Not surprised. Package was said to be delivered Friday. Nothing. Then Monday. Nothing. Then Tuesday. Nothing. On hold 35 minutes no luck. Stay far far away. Canada post is trash.
"Their overall review is so bad, even their customer service gave up. I tried to contact their customer serivce several times about the tracking, everytime they can‚Äôt even answer my question properly and send me off to their website for the answer.............. if the answer was on their website, i probably wouldn‚Äôt have contact the customer service. Btw and thanks for no update on my package. Literally the tracking does not work at all"
"The most awful, frustrating shipping experience you will ever have in your life. Received a notice for pickup, Canada Post did not even attempt delivery of a small letter-sized package (we were home, watched the courier come and go on our door camera). Went to the Canada Post at the address on the notice, after the time stated it would be available for pickup. Item not available for pickup, clerk said it was ""still on the truck, come back tomorrow."" Came back next day, it was ""still on the truck, come back tomorrow."" Came back the next day, and, you guessed it, still on the truck. Then a weekend came and went, returned on Monday and holy wow, on the fourth trip (miles each way) they finally had it. Just one of many negative and rotten experiences with Canada Post. If it's the only shipping option I'll find another vendor, just to avoid using Canada Post."
I order a package from the UK and waited the regular 12-14 days I was told to wait I also regularly checked the tracking app to see updates which were next to none and after the 14 days I waited it didn't come I checked the tracker and it had updated to no status confirmed which basically mean't i had to wait longer which was another five days and then on top of that delay I didn't even receive my package even though they marked the status as delivered I checked around my neighborhood to see if it was delivered to someone else but no it wasn't I also checked my cameras and the Amazon guy delivered his package but no CP guy came the CP van didn't even pass my house I also contacted customer support and now I need to wait a additional three days to start an investigation on my parcel and nothing else was provided to help me.
"I don't think I will consider using Canada Post again.

I applied for a citizenship in an overseas country and purchased tracking to see the progress of my package. Estimated delivery was 7-10 days BUT it took nearly a month to arrive in the country (Jul25-Aug20). The package was not sent back to me for an additional 20 days after it arrived. My tracking was only updated 4 times throughout the entire process. Extremely slow.

Thankfully, DHL sent my package back when it was signed and ready to come home. The package took three days to get home (Sept9-Sept11) and they provided me with 25 updates! Extremely satisfied with DHL and will likely use them next time"
"Sent a package internationally on August 5th via Xpress Post. Prior to sending, I asked whether international service to Vietnam was still possible. Canada Post answered yes. Package sent via Xpress Post should've been delivered within 14 days. It has now been over a month with no tracking updates. Calling customer service is utterly useless as they have no additional information from tracking updates. Completely ridiculous considering I previously sent items via Fedex and DHL with no issues. Extremely frustrating."
I live in an apartment building! And Canada post has left my parcel in the lobby several times: without even buzzing me! And then when I go to my local Canada post the manager yelled at me! Because I asked where my parcel was!
"Paying for express means nothing with this company.
They always deliver my packages way too late and they are using covid as the reason.
Do your jobs you bunch of slackers.
Everyone is dealing with Covid and a lot of people still get their work done.
But CP they say 1-4 business days delay because of Covid-19... then that turns into 5 business days."
"Never delivers the package, always makes us collect it at the post office a day later. Deems it ""too dangerous"" to walk up to our mailbox because the incompetent workers can not even walk up to a door without ""slipping""."
"Almost every time I‚Äôve worked with Canada Post, something has gone wrong. Most of the time, the products are late or damaged, and no apology or refund is offered. They sometimes even come up with lame excuses that I know aren‚Äôt true. But I don‚Äôt know If other companies do this as well, so I haven‚Äôt bothered to write a review.

But now I‚Äôm pretty angry. I know that this can vary between individual employees, but Canada Post shouldn‚Äôt be hiring people like the person who we encountered today. I ordered a 50lb box of hay for my guinea pigs, and I wasn‚Äôt here to get it. My dad (age 63), was the only one at home.

Last time I ordered a large amount of hay like this, the delivery man put it at our doorstep and rang the doorbell, so we could pick it up at our leisure (common sense would tell you that nobody‚Äôs going to steal and huge box of hay). But this time, my father was working and was in a meeting, but the delivery guy would not stop ringing the doorbell. So my dad went downstairs (had to stop his meeting), which is bad enough. But then the delivery guy said he needed help carrying the box of hay, which isn‚Äôt that heavy, and instead of helping my dad to carry the box, he made him get the box out of the truck and carry it to the house.

My dad is 63 years old and the guy didn‚Äôt even help him take the box to the house.

Canada Post is horrible, and after the thousands of complaints, they haven‚Äôt done a thing. If you‚Äôre a business reading this, please do business with someone else, for the sake of your customers."
"Awful. Living in an apartment it has been impossible to receive packages. The system is flawed because the couriers are not held responsible for the problems they cause. I have had dozens of issues attempting to receive a package at my home. The courier can improperly notify that the package is en route, they can forget to put a slip in your mail and even deliver your mail to the wrong address. Then it's a scavenger hunt trying to figure out where your package is and how to obtain it. Once it has not been delivered to your house the courier will bring it to the post office which it won't be processed right away. It might take 24 hours to simply process your package after it's already been attempted to deliver. This is extremely inconvenient and it's a form of modern day bullying. Canada Post needs to be held responsible for the poor service they provide"
"I mailed a small parcel (eyeglass case) Canada Post Xpresspost from Belleville, Ont, to Vancouver on the 26 August 2020. I was told 3 days delivery so I paid almost 18 dollars.
The tracking shows Richmond BC processing it on 3 September and processing it again on the 4 September with Delivery for 8 September. Not delivered on 8 September so I went back into tracking and found it now showed in transit again with delivery date Pending. Xpresspost taking over 2 weeks and still not delivered or any indication when or even where parcel is. Save your money and use UPS. Doubt now if parcel will be delivered as they probably lost it and are blaming Covid 19.
What a useless organization. Will be bringing this to the attention of my Member of Parliament and Canada Post Ombusdman.

UPDATE: Took over 16 days for parcel to arrive. Asked for a refund and was totally ignored by CP."
"Took them 5 weeks to Recieved a package from Montreal to Calgary, one of the slowest services provider."
"1)
Hate Canada post, they sent back the package i supposed to receive from Russia , i was waiting months for this package .
2)
Another time i tried to mail something, they failed to mail it, sent the parcel back to me , but they partly refunded me even though they accepted that was their fault , so i had to pay for second time to mail the parcel,
They sent me a cheque after several weeks as refund That i can't deposit or pay my second package with it...

Very disappointed,,,"
I wait 7 days to get my package from Ottawa to Vaughan. they sent it to Hamilton and I made many calls until I get it
I hope that someday this Canada Post will suffered a karma and I will pray on thatüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
"Poor customer service. I sent docs and phone to my husband but then it was not delivered to him. They tell you they're gonna investigate but it seems nothing happens. Worst experience ever. Give my items back! You give us so much stress! Your just only good for letters. Otherwise, it's garbage."
"Worst delivery service ever. My parcel was out for delivery in early morning, and I spent the whole day watching out of the window(just in case they don‚Äôt ring the door bell and put the notice slip, which happens all the time). And now it‚Äôs 8:14, still no Canada post, no notifications. Probably have to wait until next Tuesday to get my parcel. If this company is on strike once again, I suggest just get rid of this garbage. Can‚Äôt believe people are still paying for such awful service."
"If your fetish is for a courrier to lose your parcel, look no further! Guaranteed satisfaction, or your money not back. Yes they will stall, and stall and make you wait and wait. Heck I‚Äôm still waiting for refunds on two parcels. Very expensive products, that I‚Äôm convinced the delivery person stole. Either way, stolen or lost due to mind boggling incompetence. Canada post is by far the worst courrier Canada has to offer, despite being a crown corporation."
"Worst postal service in the world. I ordered a purse from Spain and it was here within a week. Order something an hour away and it takes longer than a week to process and get here. My parcels said ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù since 9am. It‚Äôs now 6pm and still no Canada Post. And guess what? It‚Äôs labour day weekend so I won‚Äôt receive my items until tuesday. I am so upset at this company!
Useless and complete garbage!"
"Been a month what‚Äôs the point of tracking if they can‚Äôt find a package they have lost? Waiting on a second one and well past the date it should be here .... customer service is horrible, doesn‚Äôt help, loops you in circles, they don‚Äôt scan your package in and tell you it‚Äôs not lost yet a month later they can‚Äôt help you although you‚Äôve been calling and chatting with them for weeks with same crap. We need another postal service to start up because this day and age with technology packages shouldn‚Äôt get lost in transit and never show up, tracking is useless and you have to pay for it ... go figure."
PLEASE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WHEN I FINALLY GET THROUGH TO CANADA POST (AFTER 2 HOUR WAIT) THEY SAY THAT I CAN GET A REFUND ON AN UN CASHED MONEY ORDER AS LONG AS MY NAME IS EITHER ON THE PAY TO OR PAYEE.....MY CANADA POST IN MY TOWN HAVE NO IDEA AND JUST KEEP SAYING IT WAS NOT THEIR MISTAKE (IT WASN'T.. THE COMPANY JUST RETURNED IT TO ME BECAUSE IT WAS THE WRONG AMOUNT).. I GET THEM TO CALL THEIR HEAD OFFICE BUT THE WAIT WAS 1.5 HOURS..
"Canada Post is disappointing. It seems all other delivery services have it together, at least in my experience. For an example; I order a lot through amazon, I ordered a hoodie that is coming from Tennessee, it shipped yesterday and it will be here today via UPS, I live in Alberta ffs. I order something else that is delivered via Canada Post, and the first thing they will say is "" due to external circumstances, your parcel will be delayed."" Every. Single. Damn. Time. Package is literally 2 hours away, yet it is always late! It seems like they are using covid as an excuse, still. If they are so behind; my advice to them is to hire more people ( I'm sure a lot need jobs because of covid) deliver on weekends * shock * let some smaller delivery companies deliver the damn packages. It seems they are doing nothing to try get ahead. I dread ordering online, because I don't want to see that CP is the shipping company used, and when it is, I know to expect to hear the same excuse over and over. I wonder how long covid excuse will be used for? Honestly, any other shipping company is better. At least they deliver on said date, or even before. CP, I hope you read all these thousands of horrid reviews, and actually do something about it!! Though, I wouldn't hold my breath."
"Canada Post is terrible and so much worse with Covid-19, and when they ask for more money for services that is a joke. I have important letters coming for doctors appointments/tests for my husband with Stage IV Cancer and when they do come the date they were sent is weeks from date received and also his medical supplies waiting weeks and he needs them. They were bad to begin with but now worse then ever, I am ashamed for our postal service having the name Canada attached to them......terrible,terrible..."
Our Post lady here in burstall Saskatchewan decides that she's going to send back any package with our street address on it because she's too lazy to look in her computer for the box number. Most online sites that you order from don't take your PO box number. But she just is very ignorant and lazy so she sends everybody's package back because she doesn't want to look up the PO box number. This lady is never happy she's ignorant to everybody she goes as far as to yell at people. Canada Post you need to get rid of her.
"Delays, delays, delays. They lose shipments and mismanage them. Every time is the same with these guys!"
"Had a package dropped off at our store, the worker totally ignored my greeting and immediately left without saying a word to me. Found it awfully rude considering it's a business and that it was not professional ignoring me."
"Honestly a very bad experience with Canada post. I had sended a parcel to latvia, it was an express post. I sended my parcel on July 9th. It didn't even arrived yet. I had booked service ticket, called customer service around 15-20 times. No one is answering my questions or not specifying the date of delivery. It was a parcel worth $ 2300 dollars.....very bad experience..i will never ever go to Canada post for anything."
Not a good option for services when delivering computer/big parcels. Their delivery folks will not deliver to the unit (probably to teach us a good lesson for making them work hard) . I had 2 items on 2 separate deliveries that I had to walk 2 blocks to pick my parcels. I have black listed some vendors who use canada post. They get my thumps up for letter and very small parcel deliveries.
"I'm wondering why so many of these posts are negative. I've been in lock down since March, and every single parcel I've ordered through Canada Post has arrived. Yes, one or two were delayed, but that's to be expected with the current Covid-19 situation. Canada Post is dealing with a three or four fold increase in parcel volumes. It should be understood that delays will be a given. I've had exemplary service from them. I always insure my outgoing mail in case of loss or damage.
And understand that if the mail was privatized, don't expect ANY affordable service outside of major urban centres. You'll be paying more than you pay now, or won't get service at all."
"It took 5 days for an xpresspost package to arrive within one city, 30min drive from my place. On the 5th day (Friday), once I received a notice saying the package is ready I immediately went to pick it up. And guess what - they said to come back next business day which is MONDAY because the signature is not ready yet. The package was right there!!! Please, shut those clowns down already"
"Covid my back side. I have a parcel that was scheduled to arrive on a certain day - it was scanned in Quebec 4 days ago - due today. The parcel hasn't been scanned since it arrived 4 days ago. Don't tell me that you're doing all you can when the parcel hasn't moved in 4 days. Now it still has to move from Quebec to Moncton NB, then another day to get to my location in Saint John. They make us pay more for postage but don't provide the level of service that we're paying for. It's ridiculous."
"You don't even try to deliver anything anymore, you make people to go and pick up their packages at the post office all the time, very bad service."
"I ordered 2 items from Amazon. 1 item delivered through Amazon itself - arrived safe and on time. 1 item was delivered through Canada Post. Of course it was late and damaged. Pathetic. Take Canada out of your name, since you don't care about service. Let the professionals deliver packages. For shame!"
Customer service is non-existent with these as sholes.
They full out steal your packages.. do not use these lowlife carrier .... been over a week and still saying pending .. when you call all you get is I am sorry ... pathetic!!
"Well continsualy I've been let down by Canada post, taking months for packages to arrive, blaming COVID-19 for your own lazy workers. Have had a package stolen by Canada post worker either in the sorting facility or by a deliver. The delivery truck driver even went as far to sign off on the package ripped open item missing and stuffed in the mailbox. When contacted Canada post made me jump through all kinds of loops then wouldn't cover the damages or lost property. Was just pushed aside. The most useless mail service ever would recommend using any other mail service as long as it isn't Canada post. If possible I'd give -5 stars."
"It is no wonder that there is a great market for competition (such as UPS , Purolator..etc..) Canada Post is by far the worst delivery of mail in Canada. I recently had mail (at express prices) sent from Montreal to BC sent and my letter sat in a warehouse in Richmond BC for 4 days. It is supposed to be 2 days delivery ...what happened & when will I get my letter."
"Whatever happened to the Canada Post policy, ""knock, drop, and go""? I just went back and re-read the press release from March 24th, 2020, which announced this. Parcels were to be delivered to the front door. The delivery person would ring the bell or knock on the door and then leave. Not Once has Canada Post delivered a package to my front door during this entire Covid-19 situation. Even when I had 9 or 10 kilogram (approx. 20 pounds) boxes of canned goods coming by Canada Post, the delivery person crammed the box into the largest parcel receptacle in our community mailbox; and I do mean ""crammed""! The parcel was virtually the same size as the inside dimensions of the parcel receptacle. It took 20 minutes to get it out and then I had to lug it home which is almost a block away. At 70 years of age with a chronic deteriorating back condition it took another 30 minutes to get home! This same scenario has occurred twice. Here's the dumb part of all this; Before the Covid-19 trouble Canada Post delivered all larger or heavier packages to my front door... always! Smaller packages were left in my community mail box, which is fine with me. Now, after the announcement in March that they would deliver right to the front door as a regular thing, not one package has been left at my front door! I am fed up, and, yes I have made sure now that all my orders are shipped by courier. So far, I have had no problems with any courier services. As for Canada Post... it's useless!"
"I‚Äôm waiting parcel from Europe with some cosmetics products from may 27th. Then this parcel was transferred in Canada health service (1,5 month). Somebody knows How long Canada health services may check my item. It‚Äôs really awful."
"It is the third time that I send documents within the city, in Montreal and it takes more than three months for the delivery to arrive.
At the same time I have been delivering documents overseas with Dhl and it only takes 3-5 business days.
I don't expect Post Canada deliver at that pace but at least don't take more than a month if the receiver is in the city."
"Ordered two packages being delivered with CP, in the same week from completely different regions, in Canada, on different days and they both experienced a delay?
UPS delivered my ""expected delivery September 14th"" package August 27 - two days after placing the order and one day after ordering the first package that's been held up with CP.
So, it's lead me to believe one of a few possibilities: a nation-wide hold-up physically blocking ALL logistics, or both packages somehow found themselves on the same route, or Canada Post is so inept their entire infrastructure falters with one hiccup."
"Canada post is a national embarrassment, 3 weeks and waiting on a supposed xpress post parcel sent from Vancouver to Calgary. I‚Äôm sure pony xpress could have gotten my parcel to me by now. I‚Äôm sick of hearing the COVID excuse from your corporation, I worked and am still working straight through the pandemic. I deal with human waste and didn‚Äôt have any delays in my work. What‚Äôs your excuse?"
"Dear Canada Post, we all know there are ridiculously long delays and backlogs. Why don‚Äôt you deliver over the weekends if you‚Äôre so behind??? Hire more delivery people if you need to!! You don‚Äôt scan packages, no updates, poor customer service and packages being lost on top of that. This is fraud!!"
"DO NOT SHIP WITH CANADA POST ESPECIALLY INTERNATIONAL. THEY LOOSE YOUR PACKAGE, YOU A SCREWED. NO CHANCE OF REIMBURSEMENT. THEY LOST A 500 DOLLAR US WORTH OF AN ORDER AND ALSO CHARGED ME DUTY. THEY SAY TO GET THE REFUND FROM THE SENDER, WHO IS NOT AT ALL AT FAULT! ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH THAT THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN LOST/ STOLEN OR DAMAGED AT THEIR FACILITY HERE IN CANADA. USE UPS OR FEDEX. THEY DON'T EVEN EVER PICK UP THE PHONE AT MY LOCAL OFFICE. NOW I HAVE TO DO TWICE THE WORK TO COVER A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THAT NEVER CAME. THANK YOU CANADA POST FOR MAKING TOUGH TIMES TOUGHER!"
"a useless company. customer service will never actually fix any issues, just the usual ""please open a ticket and we'll look into that"" or ""ill send that to my manager"". I've had to open about 4 tickets for one package because no one there ever fills anything out. if you have an issue with a package then there's nothing that can really be done."
"Last year I ordered some xmas presents from Amazon. One package was last handed in Azilda, I live in Alban.
After a few weeks and no sign of parcel I reordered the item and received it. A few days later Alban P.O. called to say they have had the original there for a few weeks. Yesterday I was suppose to get a parcel (according to tracking). It never made it to Alban. According to tracking it's in Azilda. $400.00 parcel is on a tour of Ontario, how nice."
Will ever any postal service work properly?!
"Dropped two packages off on August 24th to be shipped from Richmond Hill to Mississauga, and Vancouver respectively. The delivery date to the Mississauga location was set for August 26th, and to Vancouver, Sept 2nd. The delivery dates for these items have been pushed back a day each. I suspect the dates will keep being pushed back reading other reviews on here. Honestly wish I just sucked it up and drove to Mississauga myself to drop off the package.

Additionally, I ordered an item from the UK on August 22nd. It was shipped from the UK August 25th, and arrived in Canada today (August 26th). There is no tracking information available from the Canada Post as to an expected delivery date. No clue when and if I will receive the package.

UPDATE:
Package shipped to Vancouver arrived to destination on September 1st which is pretty good.

Package shipped only 45 minutes away is lost in the abyss that is the Mississauga sorting centre. It has been ""Out for Delivery,"" for 4 days. Additionally, my item I ordered from the UK is tied up in the Mississauga sorting centre as well. The expected delivery date is pending.

FURTHER UPDATE:

Item from the UK arrived September 4th after arriving in Canada on August 26th, 2020 from the UK. Total wait time overall was 9 business days.

Still waiting on package in Mississauga to be delivered to recipient as of Sept 10, 2020."
"Honest, Helpful, and Constructive"
"absolute joke of a service every time i have to deal with these people ,...whats the point of having customer service if they cant help with anything. How does it take 3 weeks to deliver something that is a 30 min drive from my house........"
"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Can‚Äôt sign for something that I paid for. Because of ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù but yet people touch things 24/7 everywhere else and I can‚Äôt even use my own pen? Out of all the things in the world and I can‚Äôt use my own pen to sign and they can‚Äôt look at my ID without touching it? Then I call to complain and ask for the woman‚Äôs name on the phone incase something goes wrong and I need to bring it up to a supervisor, and SHE HANGS UP ON ME! She knew the call was being recorded and didn‚Äôt want me to bring up a case because of how she was talking to me. Called me a child over the phone and then hung up. I paid for expedited shipping and am getting NO COMPENSATION! Canada post is a joke!!!"
"During COVID-19: My only complaint is the lack of information. I have thousands of dollars of deliveries pending from countries from which the service was suspended. It has now been 6 months and no update on the situation. I understand the need for service suspension, but I would appreciate some information on how the suspensions are progressing (i.e. are some countries being resumed, or ETA on when and which country will resume service).
Before COVID-19: When I lived in an apartment, all too often I would find a ""delivery attempted"" notice on the door of the apartment, when I was home all day. There was never a true attempt. A few times my item would just get lost on a truck, and not return to the local post office, but end up in the processing facility again."
"I had same experience like the others, missing parcels and no responses...etc.
I am giving them one star because I had bad experience with one of their stores in Etobicoke that is close to my home, the man there has really bad attitude, I am now driving all the way down to Dundas to use their other store when I need to so I don't have to see this man again."
"items from aliexpress arrived here in Canadapost's hand, but they has kept for weeks, months not yet delivery"
"My package was processed JULY 19th and STILL NO UPDATE.. absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôve submitted multiple tickets and still just saying it‚Äôs a delay in delivery .... the package is in Stoney creek which is less than 30 minutes away from my house. I even asked to have it sent back.

Worst postal service ever. thanks for ruining a pregnancy announcement package.

I would give zero stars if I could."
"Canada post sucks, I was at home all day and it says that I have missed my parcel and they said left me a notice card, which is nowhere to be found. Now I just have no idea where my things went. Really? I would never use canada post again, it's unprofessional, slow, and incompetent!"
Terrible service if you can even call it service. They claim things are delivered when they are not. Lose packages all the time. Provide no answers. I have seen better service in third world countries.
The guys who work here are theives. I followed up on my missing parcel and they simply would not tell me what happened to it. Looks like there's a whole ring in Canada Post that has a side business stealing parcels. Why shouldn't they? No one's holding them accountable and doesn't look like they have a conscience.
"Canada Post in Barrie needs to hire people who actually know their job and work. I have read that a lot of people complain about not getting their parcels and state that they went to the distribution centre where all our parcels are being held hostage and no trucks are moving, doors are locked to customers and workers are sitting outside smoking! Sure enough, I live a few blocks away and drive-by Morrow Road on purpose and sure enough, I see people smoking outside all the time when I drive to the end of the lot. This is unacceptable! These people are overpaid for smoke breaks! If I could avoid Canada Post I would! It seems the supervisor doesn't know their job and afraid to step close to the union! I am a retired federal employee and there are avenues to hire temporary replacements but it seems the person who runs this place hasn't figured that out in the last 5 months!! DO YOUR JOB!"
"Same story as a lot of you. Ordered something from Aliexpress, that entered Canada back at the beginning of Aug. Got as far as Etobicoke....tracking stopped after that. Just says pending. 11 days, still no updates, and they keep giving the same run around about being patient and that they're struggling. They're struggling because their dolts.
Can someone please fire these morons and start a new corporation."
more than 3 months and the packages never showed up
"Extremely poor service as expected from Canada Post! They never contact you and then leave a stupid note to pick it up the next day, which clearly does not make any sense. Their customer service reps do not care (I am not surprised) and are useless/rude when spoken to."
"I'm so upset with the service, I already called and complained and they were super nice to me on the phone but I got a package in the mail that said ""do not bend"" and the package was folded in the middle and bent on the side. It was my Diploma. Something I worked 3 years for. With the pandemic it had to be sent by mail but I really wish I could have picked it up instead.. not too happy about this"
"Canada Post should be ashamed. It's this far into the pandemic and they still can't get there packages delivered on time. It was fine early on, companies need time to adapt but this is outrageous. If you can't keep up the the demand stop your service, simple."
"No stars I spend a fortune on ensuring a parcel would be tracked end to end from UK Royal mail as it was important and to be delivered to the MAYOR of Muskoka
I sent parcel on 20 May
He finally Received the ruined parcel on 14 August!
This is pathetic and totally unnecessary
I AM A FRONTLINE NURSE - you are just dealing with letters and packages
You ha e caused great upset a waste of time and my money
Shame on you - looking at your horrendous reviews how can a company continue like that??? So wine ya making money out of this fir sure"
"Excellent service. They delivered the product accurately on time. Very happy with the service. However, they should have knocked or called while dropping the parcel in front of the door! Highly recommended"
They lost my parcel that can't be replaced. They had no info for me and said I should contact the sender.
"Canada Post deserves no stars. I had an order from Ontario get sent to St John's Newfoundland. I live in Vancouver! I have yet another package coming from Ontario, shipped three days ago, according to the shipper. Try to track it today- item not found. Naturally, I'm paranoid that I'll never receive it. Bloody disgraceful."
"Unfortunately I had to give them a one star rating to write my review.
I have had an on going problem with receiving my express post packages. What is express post? It means that it takes priority and should be processed first!
I include my buzzer code every time.. and they are too lazy to punch in my buzzer code!
I have complained to their virtual chat about this and get told.. oh we will address the letter carrier and appropriate measures will be taken.
Really?
Is that why today when I tracked my package it said.. notice left.
But this time.... there was NO notice left in my mailbox!
And when I bring this question up in the virtual chat... where is my notice card?.... after 3 seconds... my message disappears so I get NO answer!
Oh.. and by the way... you pay a fortune to ship packages with Canada post and the employees at Gateway facility DO NOT take care of how they handle your packages. Most of the employees are standing around talking and watching movies on their cell phones!
This is what you‚Äôre paying for!!"
"I‚Äôm actually crying out of frustration of how FING IRRITATING YOUR PEICE OF SHI PHONE WAIT BS YOU ‚Äúhave‚Äù to tell ppl even tho it‚Äôs all common fing knowledge, how about you just play music or stfu like every other wait line, like GENUINELY crying out of frustration bro and on top of that you actually want me to beilive that there wasn‚Äôt ONE person to get the phone after 17 minutes???? It‚Äôs a fing post office how long is ONE phone call with anyone really gonna last, the worst fing service and I never even got to talk to a person, absolutely fing pissed"
"So I left off on Friday 14 August - parcel now been on its staycation (From BC) since August 8. Back from Edmonton to Calgary (its destination) but, oops, gone again this time to Okotoks. I am wondering if I will get a postcard from each place it visits like the kidnapped garden gnomes. August 17 parcel left Okotoks back to Calgary. August 18 parcel delivered.
In relation to the other reviewer who said his parcels arrive from Britain faster - I have to disagree. This parcel from BC took 9 days. Parcels from the UK either never arrive or take up to four months. From UK to Canada is speedy then the Canada snail picks it up and walks it across the country.
Wish me luck as I mail important government documents to the UK."
I dont know how this delivery service is still running. Ive gotten so many packaged over the years and whenever I find out im getting it from Canada post I'm extremely dissapinted. Not once has my package showed up at my door. They always leave notices and I need to pick it up. That IS NOT delivery. So many packages show delivered that I have not recieved. Everytime I get a package through Canada Post I have such a stressful time trying to locate it. I have filed so many tickets with Canada Post its not even funny. WORST delivery service ever!
"I MAILED A PACKAGE JULY 19th. The people at the post office I mailed it to you didn‚Äôt tell me that service was suspended to the area I was sending it to on July 10. It was last updated July 20 saying it wasProcessed and Is sitting in Stoney creek. I submitted a service ticket August 10 To see if my shipment could get sent back to me as this has very valuable items in it. No response. And then called again August 14 and Got another service ticket resubmitted. Canada post is an absolute joke, with no time management of help . I WOULD ATLEAST HAVE LIKED IT TO BE SENT BACK TO ME BEFORE AUGUST 30th but instead im getting the run around of they can only do so much. Very Pissed off."
My package was supposed to be delivered almost two weeks ago. It‚Äôs medication that I have to get online now because of covid. It‚Äôs in my city but on the day it says it‚Äôs supposed to be delivered nobody comes and it changes to delivery pending.
"Support Loop of hell

Phone us -> okay i do that
On Phone -> write US a ticket

Searching the effin ""create Ticket"" Option but it does Not seem to be there unless i have an effin Account.


I Just want to know AS a Receiver where my package is and No i Dont want to create an Account for that information.

I am working also AS Support and omg your Ticket statistics must be so nice, with all that , how many Tickets you get 1 per 10.000 Users ?


That a Joke and slowly i Beginn doubting the legal Side of that.

Pls Dont argue now with covid.

The parcel was meint to be delivered in 6th of August and since then i did Not get any Updates and the Auto Tracking Tool only resetten it self that my parcel is now in canada again ?


You are kidding me right ?"
"Yet another Canadian JOKE!!!

Six days from Calgary to Toronto (Expedited Post) then when I check the tracking number it says they left me a note directing me to pickup the item at the post office. They didn't leave a note and after checking my home camera...they didn't come to the house.
It gets better...they want me to provide ID having the address where the item was to be delivered to. I have 2 residences and my GOV'T ID shows the address of my OTHER principal address.
I cancelled my order...disputed my CC charges for goods paid for and not received.
In the future any Cda Post deliveries will be met with me simply cancelling the order and buying elsewhere.
CP...truly is a JOKE but seems to be inline with Purolators concept of customer service.
Interesting how I NEVER have these issues with US Mail/UPS or FedEx."
"Yes they do Frigging SUCK, second time now where EXPRESS POST never showed. Not sure what the POINT is in Paying Money to have S**T either not show or DAMAGED..

Last time they said the person delivered to the FEONT DOOR, I said oh ya considering I DONT HAVE A FRONT Frigging DOOR. LOL

I take Screen Shots of everything to do with the GOV, and on their ""Famous Tracking App"" you can specify where to have ot delivered, I SPECIFY ( SIDE PORCH FIRST DOOR ) WHERE IT SAYS ""SPECIAL DELIVERY NOTES""...

OH AND AS WELL AS A ""SIGNATURE"", NOW THIS WAS LIKE 6 WEEKS BACK, THE GUY SAYS OH NO NO WE DONT DO ""SIGNATURES"" SO I SAID THEM WHY IS IT ON YOUR WEBPAGE THEN.. MADE HIM READ IT ALL, GUESS WHAT IT ""WAS THERE"", JUST AS I SAID


This time who the HELL knows, I goto the post office 2 weeks back to open a P.O. Box Num figuring ok well this won't happen again..
The guy in the Post office takes my ID and clicke on the computer for about 3 seconds and hands me a Reciept THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WSS PUT OF A 70's CASH REGISTER lol, you know just a little paper.

I asked him if I pick up my Parcels here or the frigging Mall lol (I LIVE 2 MIN WALK FROM BROADWAY POST OFFICE ) because I normally have to goto the mall to get anything. He says ya you will get an Email or a Ticket to come and pick them up there ( BROADWAY ).

So Friday im not around and when i get home I get an email ( only recieve them on WIFI ) Because I really hate notifications lol.

Anyways i look for my 2 Parcels and nothing in site, first off why would anyone leave something at the FRONT DOOR if o D9NT EVEN HAVE ONE. LOL

OH AND AS FAR AS THEM KNOCKING THEN LEAVING DUE TO THIS ( SOCIAL DISTANCING BULL S**T), YA WELL THEY DONT DO THAT EITHER.

I have a Dog and so does the owner downstairs, and both go nuts over the Smallest of Knocks. So on Thursday I went to Leave and whats sitting their Blocking my Sreen Door, A Parcel.
Well I knew it couldn't me mine considering I only ordered my crap on Wednesday ( DELAYS AND ALL ) and I knew mine didn't even ship until Thursday with a DELIVERY DATE OF AUG 17, WHICH I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE WEEKEND..

Turns out it was the OWNERS, Both Downstairs ( Retired ) and ACTUALLY have a FRONT DOOR.

OTHERWISE I WOULD OF BEEN HERE WAITING FOR MY PARCELS..

Pretty funny I'm always getting My landlords packages and my Next door Neighbor gets 80% of mine ( HE ALSO HAS NO FRONT DOOR) LOL..

The FIRST TIME I never even recieved my package ever back in early July ( WHICH ALSO TOOK ALMOST 6 WEEKS FOR THEIR INVESTIGAION ) Jusy got RESOLVED last Tuesday..
Oh and nothing to do with CANADA POST EITHER, I've been ordering off THIS VENDOR from ""BC"" Now for 7 or 8 Years now.
My sales Rep was the one that just Refunded me and suggested for me to get a
""FLEX P.O. BOX #"" to solve my PROBLEMS.. BECAUSE HE SAID ( CANADA POST IS VERY UNRELIABLE ), and so thats when I went to the POST OFFICE to SET UT UP..

So Yesterday I PHONE the CANADA POST ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT"" she say yep I see you have a P.O. BOX NUMBER, but she also said you need to put that address in. I said well it might have been nice if the GUY TOKD ME THAT... hat if they dont have that option, because some places don't ( THE SOURCE ) BUT THATS A WHOLE NOTHER STORY.. LOL

So I told her EXACTLY what the Postal Worker told me when I opened my P.O. BOX # and dhe says well did he not give you a PACKAGE, and insaid to her all i recieved was an invoice from the 70's with a total of $0.00 charged, so now i have to go through all this again..

THEN SHE SAYS WELL ARE EMAILS WEREN'T GOING OUT AT THAT TIME, BUT NOW THEY ARE RESOLVED.
I SAID WELL ISINT THAT JUST FRIGGING GREAT, GLAD TO HEAR THAT. ALMOST 2 WEEKS LATER AFTER OPENING THE ""P.O. #"".

I SIAD AND IF THEY ARE NIT DOING SIGNATURES ( WHICH IS A LIE ) THEN HOW COME THE NIEGHBORS ACROSS THE STREET GET A KNOCK AND ALSO SIGN, THIS DUMBASS SAYS WELL ITS AT THEIR DECRESSION ( RIGHT AFTER SAYING NO SIG)

OH AND WHAT IS THE POINT IN POSTING DELAY NOTICES ALL OVER YOUR ""WEB SITE"" IF NOW THINGS ARE SHOWING DATES THAT DONT EVEN MATTER..


I WOULD IF NEVER LEFT IF I KNEW THEY WERE COMING THE DAY AFTER I ORDERED THE STUFF..

UNF****GREAL."
"The only shipping company I consistently have issues with; every single shipment is delayed by days to weeks. I can't remember a single shipment from them that was even close to on time.

Avoid if possible, support companies that get the job done."
If I can give zero rate would be perfect! Why f*** they close permanently for good.. worst express delivery.. been over 10 days waiting to deliver in same city.. why they don‚Äôt close so we can just move with other services.. fml
Brutal service every single time I send anything or receive anything. Laziest and most useless employees on the planet. Can‚Äôt wait for Canada to privatize the mail sector and put these losers out of business.
These guys are garbage... avoid shipping with these clowns at all costs. Pay extra for a 'guaranteed' delivery date that shows up a week late.
I recently puchase something online taking over a month to come still didn't received it .... canada post what is wrong with your services dont care if it covid or not....
"Delivery of mail is going to wrong adresses , parcels going to wrong addresses saying delivered then luckily the other people are honest and bring it to my home this is several times ,, just this week i got 2 pieces of mail on 2 separate days that werent mine ,, i just remailed into mail slot ,,, so how much am i not getting ?? Tried to question the incompetent driver while back about his poor service ,, he didnt really seam to care , not his problem but isnt it his job ... what a loser !! Its non stop horrible service,,, ive never had trouble with other delivery companies !!! Canada Post is disgusting,, maybe read the nearly 100% of negative comments and experiences and try better !!!"
"I loath everything about Canada post. From their bull crap lies, to them losing multiple packages. And when they do FINALLY deliver a package to me, one mail carrier leaves it at my door, the next one says they can't leave it outside my door due to COVID. Ok. But 2 days ago u delivered two packages to my door. I am pretty sure COVID didn't go away in 48 hours. Just be consistent. You all should be on the same page when it comes to ur slow ass deliveries and how to properly and safely execute them. I hate every thing about this joke of a mail delivery system. You expected me to leave my special needs kids alone to go to the lobby to retrieve my package. Drop it outside my damn door already. I am home alone with a special needs child, right in the middle of a bum change. You ever change a 6 year olds bum?? It's a process. Let me just stop what I am doing, leave her alone, so that I can go get my eyeshadow palate!!! Logic. FEDEX, UPS, DHL, USE ANYONE BUT CANSDA POST!!!!!"
Company is an embarrassment to be Canadian! I think COVID has become there go to excuse to work less and less delivered. Amazing that all other courier companies are still getting it done without the excuses! You are a JOKE! Hope the Feds sell you off!
"Recently i pay like $12-16 for ""Regular Parcel"" and they never deliver it. Their lies say it will deliver within 2 business days province wide and it's been another 7 business days (i understand delays from COVID) and it hasn't arrived like every day i look in my mailbox i see junk mail/flyers. I don't contact them anymore because before they just give me excuses and blah blah blah that's not even worth listening to. I mean with Amazon/UPS they give accurate delivery times with no excuses. This is the 10th time this month this has happened I only had 2 packages come within the delivery standard. Canada post is using COVID-19 to their advantage to not have people complain about long delivery times. Absolute waste of money"
"I sent out a package over a month ago and paid extra for express, hoping it would come as soon as possible. I was told that there might be 2 weeks delay due to covid but it's been over a month. I called customer service and went to the actual canada post near me and they couldn't even help me figure out where the package is. I am really frustrated because I paid more for express but it still hasn't arrived until now. I should have just went with the normal price if either options arrive at the same time. I will never go back to Canada post again, so disappointing."
"Bad Service as expected from Canada Post!
Sent a LETTER expresspost for Spain paid extra . Said 3 to 7 open days for delivery it's now 23 OPEN DAYS!!! Still not delivered. I understand with Covid-19 delays but this!!! A parcel from CHINA arrived in that time!!!"
"XPRESSPOST ISN'T SO EXPRESS.
JUST GIVES FALSE HOPE TO PEOPLE.
PAY EXTRA FOR SOMETHING DELAYED AND AGENTS ON CHAT JUST LEAVE BEFORE CONFIRMING ANYTHING NOT EVEN A ""GOODBYE""

MY PACKAGE WSN'T EVEN ATTEMPTED TO GET DELIVERED. DELAYED UPDATES ON LL FRONT"
"I don't even know why i am surprised, yet again, at CP's complete failures.

Expecting two parcels yesterday. (one to my home, one to the local post office)

One to my home. (Expedited): Monday 10th Aug - Said due delivery Tuesday 11th, 9am-1pm. When i track today (the delivery due date) - its ""Check Delivery Progress"" (With a note saying item delayed by one business day).

Item to the Post Office: ""Out For Delivery"" today (Tuesday 11th Aug). Now says ""expected Delivery Aug 10th"". THIS IS TO THEIR OWN POST OFFICE.

Im past disgusted. Im now at the stage where i see something is coming via CP, i just take it i wont get it.

This is the 11th package they have ""lost"" since Covid, and that's all they use as an excuse. Even when THEY lose something, they pass the buck back to the sender.

Amazon: Fine. UPS: Fine. DHL: Fine. FEDEX: Fine.
Canada Post: Due to COVID...... blah blah blah.

Its a complete joke. I hate you CP. I truly and utterly detest you."
"They can't even knock on a door to deliver a package, need I say more? Seriusly $1000+ valued package all tracked and needs to be signed for, waiting for it at the front door and they just leave a slip in the mailbox without even trying to deliver the package, not one knock; forcing me to wait all day to pick it up later. What an insult. They really need to get it together especially after having went on strike for their demands not being met in 2019, winning the strike then performing even crappier afterwards. I'm not sure if this is just how they believe buisness should be done but it's incredibly awful for the customer and needs to improve dramatically. At this rate you can't keep asking why people are switching to alternative slightly more expensive options such as fedex, purolator, loomis etc, when they actually commit to their service and aren't scared to knock on a door."
"Canada Post package delivery is just absolutely awful.
Packages are sitting in warehouses and distribution centres for weeks and often even more than a month,
I am expecting packages which are sitting in Mississauga for over a month, in Montreal for over a month, in Regina for over two weeks and nothing is moving. There is nothing one can do.
It is obvious that the pandemic is used as an excuse for not doing any work. If it is true that they are overloaded, then hire more people. There are presently hordes of people out there looking for a job.
As can be expected from a Crown Corporation, which is accountable to nobody, management of Canada Post is just sitting on its hands. Time for a serious shake up."
"Xpresspost shipping and yet my order has been sitting in a distribution centre 45mins away from me for nearly a week.

They have changed my delivery date twice; was supposed to arrive today, but I guess they think I want to wait for it to be bundled together with an order I made from China before they deliver (a practice they have taken up since this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù theatre began).

Doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a point to paying extra for xpresspost anymore."
"I understand that with COVID-19, things might be delayed which is totally fine, but the first time I have encountered delivery via. Canada post, I haven't had a package arrive on time. Other couriers that have delivered to me have been on time with no issues nor backups, except for Canada post in which delivery was backed up by 3 days, and I am still waiting."
"Ordered a couple of tshirts through a lady to support her youtube channel. She shipped them out and we thought with all the delays at the border this may have been what happened. Turns out Canada Post delivered our item to who knows on July 20, 2020. Last week we received a package for a house down the street along with our own package. We put their package in their mailbox as we could not locate the mail courier who had delivered the package. They take no care to read or check to be sure they are delivering to the right home address."
"Riping off people saying express post. I have choose express post (Paid - $72) for three days shipping, but the shipment didn't reach on time (Reached after 25 days). Now they say "" Due to Covid delivery may vary depending on the circumstances"". My question is if they can't keep up the promises why are the services still active and ripping of people pocket? When I can ship it in regular mail and pay less.

Never trust Canada post, they hide things from you and they wont be concerned about your package and making billions of dollar from people stress."
What a rip off! You pay top dollars for a supposedly rapid service and all you get is crap! The tracking systems means nothing as I am unable to locate my envelope and package. What has happened to Canada Post?
"I wonder how long they will use the Covid as an excuse for poor service.. They must be loving this. EACH parcel / letters / boxes; ANYTHING is stuck 3-4 WEEKS at EACH major ""points"" in Canada. Ordered from the US in May.. MAY ! 3 days to get to the borders, then CA Post finally put the tracking online now.. IN AUGUST DAMNIT"
"Would leave a 0 review if I could.
2 packages, one USPS, one Royal mail. July 7 departed both countries. Hit Canadian Border Agency and/or Canada Post. Black hole. No tracking. No info. No packages. Quarantine? Really? Just an excuse to be lazy users of my tax paying dollars. Don't care that they are union. One is a public service, the other Crown corporation. MY money. No service."
They charge so much extra money for priority shipping and my packs still take the same time to arrive. This the second time i paid for priority shipping and it took LONGER than the last time i order Xpresspost from the same vendor. Why are they still charging for priority shipping when its not any quicker. This is robbery and im pissed off.
"Terrible service. Was waiting for a package all week and they then delayed the original expected date, then when the day comes they leave a ""notice"" sign at my door saying I have to go pick it up the next business day. Isn't the point of ordering something to your house is you get it delivered and not have to go buy it in person. Never ordered from a company so useless."
"The only thing they can deliver on time are flyers. Oh wait...that‚Äôs usually a separate person. Never mind. They‚Äòre literally terrible. It‚Äôs every time. Every god damn time, they‚Äôre late. Xpresspost should be called ‚Äúpay us more, and go F yourself‚Äù. Garbage operation."
"I was supposed to receive 8 package all at the same time but I only got 3. I went to the nearest location at my address which is the thickwood plaza 299b-121 Signal Road, Fort McMurray, Alberta, AB T9H 4N6, Canada to find out why but the grumpy old lady employee doesn't seem to be helpful. I was there on August 7,2020 @ 11:50a.m."
"FREAKING NIGHTMARE!

3 days late: I'm so sorry for the delay
2 weeks later: I'm so sorry for the delay
1 month later: Im so sor...

F YOU!"
"Canada post is the most slow postal delivery around, if you send something don't send it with them, it will either get lost or take forever to get anywhere. Then they screw up addresses all the time and send things to the wrong sorting facilities. Something that is supposed to be delivered in three days took more than a week. I ordered something from the other side of Canada two days after something was sent out with canada post. I used purolator courier to send the item from the other side of canada and the other was through canada post. The item from across canada was delivered two days before the item came with canada post, also the item that was sent through canada post was in the same city where I live. Even before covid-19 the service with canada post was terrible and it is even worse now. They really need to change how they do things especially if it's going to be like this for a long time. Use another courier if possible if you want you parcel to get to where it's going in a reasonable time. Don't use canada post!!"
I bought bike parts from Amazon third-party shipped by Canada Post paid for expedited service was supposed to get here within 3 to 4 days 8 days later still hasn't arrived I cancelled my order with Amazon went directly to third-party reorder had it shipped by in intelecom got it in 3 days we'll be dealing with Intellicom FedEx for all deliveries there reliable the crowned own postal Canada is the worst mail service you can deal with in Canada consider the fact back in April the government ordered 4 million Masks and used outside delivery service. Not their own just goes to prove the point crappy service
"Being over 70 we have ordered numerous items via online ordering. Everything shipped Canada Post is processed through Mississauga. I call this the vacation destination for parcels. The tracking shows them there for at least 2 weeks even if shipped ""expedited"". I have contacted retailers and told them to stop sending my items through Canada Post. At present waiting for 3 shipments ordered July 17. 2 are in CP system. 3rd package..no tracking. CP ..When your business expands, hire more people to get work done and keep customers happy. Why are retailers still shipping CP when results so bad?"
They do not use common sense and overlook the obvious. They sent a item back to its sender without even trying to look for the business it was supposed to be dropped off at . I‚Äôve had problems with them many times . Go with fed ex
Be careful who you talk on the phone regarding claims/refunds some staff very unknowledgeable and will try to missguide you . I had to speak to 3 different reps to get my refund and re open a claim they closed on me due to their fault and not mine
"Canada post needs to be completely destroyed and re created as something else entirely, or reworked and all current employees let go. The service and wait times(even before covid) are the definition of the word 'unnacceptable'."
"Expresspost Parcel sitting on Winnipeg since 1:46 AM July 30, 2020 with delivery date pending. Supposed to have been delivered to Saskatchewan yesterday. Your service is a negative 100,000, not acceptable. I received a parcel from California faster than a parcel from Ontario. Explain that!!!!!!!"
"Appalling service from everyone. I sent a small package express to Israel on June 29 and paid $101 because the employee told me delivery was guaranteed in 6 days. It is now 5 weeks later and the package has not been delivered.

I have spoken to a senior customer service officer, Christine, who referred me to the person supposedly in charge of international deliveries (at extension 8880454). She failed to get back to me until‚ÄùChristine finally contacted her supervisor. She the called me and said that she would get back to me by August 3 with details of when the package would be delivered. She did not call. I have left her messages on August, 3, r and 5, but she has not called back. I also left messages for Christine on August 4 and 5, but she has not called back. I am beyond frustrated."
"I ordered my monthly bus pass($97 in value) and the city service mailed out through Canada Post but Canada Post lost it, and I reordered again then Canada post lost it again"
5kg parcel from Germany to Canada: 5-7 days for $60 including tracking and insurance - other direction with Canada Post 4-6 weeks $420 (cheapest option) or $685 if you want a delivery within 6-8 days. What is wrong with this picture...?
"My international package arrived in Canada in June 18 and has been sitting in their plant ever since. Its been 1.5 months now, i can walk around the earth in that amount of time."
"Canada Post is truly the worst. I pay a premium for ""Xpresspost"" service which guarantees 2-day delivery. It will now be delivered at the EARLIEST 9-10 days from the original handling date. Absolutely ridiculous, how is this not the same as an economy service? Why did I pay for the so-called ""Xpresspost"" if I'm getting ""Shittypost."" I feel ripped off. Called an agent, got some BS script-based answers, and even when saying ""it could be a year from now and it could be delivered?"" I was told ""NO GUARANTEES!"" Are you f**king kidding me?"
"Usually Canada Post is fine.
But an important package didn't arrive.
After over a week dealing with CP support and opening a ticket, they never found my package.
They said that it had to have arrived at the post office where I was to pick it up.
There, they said it wasn't there.
Then, one day I went in to pick up a different package and the agent ACCIDENTALLY gave me the original, ""lost"" package, thinking it was the one I was there for.
I didn't discover this until I got back home.
I had to go back and show her that my orig package was in fact there and now she had to find the one I came in form.
Due to this error, the tracking code for the one I went in for, now showed it as being delivered, when now that one was still there.
She was able to find it right away.

Canada post has NOT been consistent of late."
Always late.. terrible
My package was supposed to be delivered a day ago. It is now Friday before a Holiday and I was told it would not be delivered today either. I have deadlines to meet with this package and there is no where I can go pick up my package. I should be able to go pick my package up since Canada Post couldn't deliver. Canada Post is trash and I've had nothing but issues. If I have a choice I never use Canada Post.
"Completely useless! Bought something from someone in the US who accidentally wrote the wrong apartment number, but we didn't realise until it was delivered to said apartment number that just so happens to be a vacant apartment. Contacted Canada Post and explained the situation, confirmed it has my name on and the address it should've gone to and even said I can supply sufficient evidence to prove it should've come to me but the wrong apartment number had been written. Told it could be sorted no problem or it may have to be sent back to sender to be readdressed, which I guess makes sense. Up until today the package could be seen in the incorrect mailbox and now it's gone, with no confirmation from Canada Post that it has been taken by them even though they are aware of the situation and have our contact details. I have contacted them via web chat only to be told that this is not something they can sort once the package has been delivered, even though someone on the phone said it could be?! Also no information as to whether or not they are the ones who have taken the package even though no one else has access to the mail box. Sounds like everyone needs retraining as different people are making up different rules!!! The package contained something of significant importance to me and now I have no idea where it is thanks to Canada Post's incompetence."
Only thing they deliver consistently is disappointment
"Just stop giving expected delivery dates if everything is a mess. Instead give us a range of time when it should be expected. It's extremely frustrating for the customers to buy something they are excited for, to have it NOT arrive on the expected date and to make it worse, have absolutely no clue when it will arrive because no updates are given. Giving us a wide range of when to expect it will reduce this frustration and your 1 star reviews."
"Canada post is so bad at their jobs I don't even think they should legally be allowed to operate anymore. They lose mail none stop, constantly rerouting issues, constant wrong addresses. Nothing but pain and trouble when Canada Post is involved. They don't even question the address and will drop your package off in the middle of the street. Other companies take pictures of what they delivered and where, meanwhile Canada post cannot even recall where they lost your package at the same day they lost it. Its actually so pathetic they should be sued out of business. My address has been given away to all the wrong addresses they have delivered my things too. I'm convinved you need to have an IQ lower than 5 to work for this brain dead company"
"I ordered a package on June 18th from the US. It finally arrived in Canada and handed over to Canada Post on 17 July. I followed on the tracker which indicated a delivery date of 23 July. That day came and went and the tracker basically went dead at that point saying that no delivery date was available. On 30 July I contacted Canada Post via the virtual chat - I asked for a delivery date and I was told I would have it no later than 28 August. That is almost 3 complete months for a small package, and a month too late as it is a gift for someone.
The Pony Express was apparently able to deliver messages from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific Coast in and around 10 days!

Canada Post is a pathetic organization. It should be cut as a Crown Corporation. I will never utilize Canada Post service ever again if it is within my power to do so.
All other private courier services have not missed a beat since COVID started - what the hell is going on with CP?? Disgusting level of service."
"My package(s) are late every time I use Canada Post. They use COVID-19 as an excuse... Meanwhile, EVERY other courier that I have used since COVID-19 has not skipped a beat. Cheap cop-out for a cheap company. Avoid at all costs."
"I have a small package that stopped tracking on USPS site on July 4th, its now July 29th...nothing... the tracking number can't even be found on Canada Post site!!! last scan said ""DEPARTED, VANCOUVER CANADA"" now nothing, not even a scan saying its with boarder services, so I guess I got robbed for $120"
Canada Post is one of the worst I have experienced. The packages take so much time to be delivered it's like coming from another planet or galaxy. Please do something about it.
Defund Canada Post...brutal delivery time.
"It is mystifying that this company continues to exist. The level of service belongs to the Stone Age. They made a mistake with my first delivery and then they promised to rectify it and deliver my package to the correct address only for them to return to sender without even informing me. It took an entire month for the package to get to Canada in the first place and now I don't know what to do.
Horrible Horrible company!!!"
"Wish i could give 0 stars.. I don't think there is a single courier service worst than Canada Post.. Every single one of my packages (coming from within the country a few provinces away) have been either terribly late, lost or going for joy rides around the city before being delivered. They have shady practices such as marking an item or notice delivered BEFORE the driver gets to deliver it, or even worse, still charging extra for express items and not refunding late items.. I don't remember the last time I had, not even a good, but at least a decent experience with this sad excuse for a courier. I've never spoken with anyone who hasn't had a ton of issues with Canada Post. Avoid at all cost!"
"Not sure why Canada Post is so bad. Several times they have taken my packages for joy rides. From Mississauga past my place to Quebec then back to my place.
The most recent package that still hasn't arrived yet. Starts off in Markham. Destination Toronto. Where is it now? Richmond BC....Seriously?!?!? How?!?!?"
"Paid for ""priority mail"" and ""expidited mail"", factored in expected delays due to covid 19, and yet still late{not yet delivered. though arrived in Missisauga Ontario processing, then to scarborough processing facilites over a month ago}... yet *regular mail sent from same sender to same and other addresses has arrived. When you present this to their online chat help they just continuously site that ""there are NO garaunteed delivery dates available due to covid 19"" but still offer priority and expidited mail and parcel delivery at an extra cost and even offer an estimated delivery time that factors in covid 19 measures related delays. and accept your{our} money for said so called faster delivery options. but drag their feet, make excuses and blame the sender. even though we have track your parcel options that confirm senders information!!??!!"
"To be honest, helpful and constructive I recommend that Canada Post be quietly consigned to the annuls of history as soon as possible. It appears to be beyond redemption.
I ordered a small plastic part on-line which took 37 days to deliver, of which 30 were in the hands of Canada Post. On July 20 a prescription was mailed from Richmond Hill to my address in Tiny, less than a 2 hour drive. Today, July 27, their tracking report says it is in Barrie with no delivery date available. If these were the only examples they might be forgivable, but they represent only a few of many negative experiences with this bloated, inefficient, poorly managed and union-strangled organization. Canadian taxpayers would be well served by the demise of Canada Post."
"In only 2 months, Canada post lost many of my mail. They are very slow (and they were slow before Covid-19). They are very expensive... not happy with Canada post."
"Can't deal with Canada Post any longer. I have been home all day and haven't left once. I did not receive a knock on my door but when I check a few minutes ago, it says my parcel was delivered. My mailbox is not big enough to fit the package and I am on the main street in Welland. The message says they dropped off my parcel in my locker or community mailbox, which I don't have. If they left it by my door, it is for sure stolen.

This is Canada Post's suggestion on their website:

Trying to find your package?
Sorry! This happens sometimes. Please check your front porch, side door, back porch, garage area, bushes, and mailbox to make sure it‚Äôs not hiding or jammed. Also ask your neighbors if they may have received it for you. If your package still hasn‚Äôt turned up in 3 more days, please contact us.

Really, look in the bushes or ask your neighbours? What kind of ridiculous service is this? They may as well just throw the packages out the window. Why is Canada Post still in business and who pays for my lost package -sure as hell not Canada Post!

How is this company still in business. Their whole job is to pick up and deliver things, and they are not able to do this. Time is long overdue for this business to fold."
"Per their delivery status, I had a parcel coming from Japan which was supposed to be delivered to my mailbox today. I know there should be taxes I need to pay before I can get my stuff so I signed up for email notificationÔªø to receive delivery status updates. I got the email at 0504 in the early morning for online payment option. Got up at 0700 and tried clicking on the pay botton but canada post was experiencing technical difficulties. Then I tried tracking the parcel on their website and it was the same problem. However, it worked well if I tracked other parcels..so it seems like a case-specific technical difficulties...... Well, I then called customer service and was told parcel arrived at local facility at 0520 and after that customers would be unable to make an online payment. This is ridiculous because they only gave 16 mins to pay....in the early morning when you are still sleeping...Agent then told me I have to pick up the parcel tomorrow after 1300 in the postoffice. That is, I need to wait one more day to get the parcel and will have increased risk of getting infected when visit the post office..."
"Letter from Cambridge, ON to Manitoulin Island, ON.
2 weeks in, no delivery yet."
"I've been waiting for an important, time sensitive package. Paid >$50 for Express Post. After reading all the other reviews which are 99% negative, I see now that the term Express Post is an oxymoron. Canada Post is the worst. They are basically a useless service that is almost completely unreliable. Theft, miss routing of packages, systematic late delivery, staff who are far more focused on their rights rather than delivering the service they are paid for. It is time for Canada Post to dissolve and allow private courier services to take over. Canada Post is a dinosaur. They have failed to keep up with the times and have failed to upgrade their systems to compete effectively with private industry. I will avoid using Canada Post an almost all costs.
Dear Canada Post: it's over. Lift your head up and look at the thousands of dissatisfied customers. Look at your competitors. You suck; admit it. Dissolve and save the tax payers money."
"I wish I could put 0 stars. I was awaiting an important medical package, it got to Montreal and no one ever rang my doorbell, as I stayed home that day to receive it. I checked online and it said it was being returned to the sender because I could not be located. When I called them 20 minutes after I saw that update. They said there is nothing they can do. I asked to speak to a manager (first time in my life I had to resort to that) she said she would call me back to let me know if she could intercept it. When the package was clearly still in Montreal. She said she‚Äôd even call me back if she couldn‚Äôt do anything. The item was processed out of my city 6 hours later so we had plenty of time. Manager never called me back and now my important package is on its way back to Vancouver for no logical reason. Terrible service, no accountability for their mistake, no logical explanation ever given as to why it was returned or what happened with the driver."
"Some how I got stuck in an abusive relationship with a pathological liar and a kleptomaniac. Thank God for the class action lawsuit to help get me out of this mess (Lambert Avocat Inc).

"I have been dealing with CP for past several decades, although they are not perfect, am getting my stuff either delivered or received. Thank you Canada Post."
I would have rated Canada post zero if I could cause that what they are the most unreliable post service ever and doesn't matter what time even before the epidemic they were trash and know there ever worse they like to use the epidemic as excuse for their felliar to do their work. A service that a 5 year old could do better. the this morons at Canada post should find another job their good at like flipping burgers at McDonald's that more their level instead of cheating people out of their money and not delivering when they are supposed. How is it that a garage truck is always on time but Canada post is never on time.
They are terrible and should be shut down as a delivery service. They don't deliver items on time and there is no way to talk to them and ask about the product delivering on time.
"Canada Post should eliminate its ‚Äútracking service‚Äù as in practice, it already has. It is a fluke if a consumer can actually access tracking information. Generally, after inputting the lengthy number provided, no information can be found. The norm is that no information is posted until something is ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it will be delivered the day that information is posted even though it is generally posted early in the morning.
Recently, Canada Post has refused to accept mail that was delivered to the wrong address. It is left to the recipient of the erroneous delivery to get the package or mail to the proper address. If more attention was paid to the street name on mail items rather than just the number, this would never be a problem."
Two postmen passed me the notice that my parcel cannot be delivered because I am not home. The time gap between failed delivery and my appearance approximately 2 min. They even did not bother themselves to bring the delivery to my home. Wasted my time by waiting home. Not first time such ignorance for customers even not the fifth.
"I'll put things in perspective as simple as possible.
4 years ago, that's right I said 4 years ago I ordered a part for my vehicle from Germany .
It arrived last week. 18 of July 2020
The parcel was claimed as lost or stolen. By Canada Post.
LMFAO.. they simply suck the f***ING bag.
someone said it besr, tax payers money at its finest..
Customs also can go and suck a fat one as they also abuse the power of the uniform.
Bunch A-holes ..
So from now on I'll deal only with DHL PAY EXTRA but I know that I will get it.ASAP."
Literally every package I order through them is a week late. A group of monkeys could deliver parcels faster then these clowns.
it's ok but its now taken over a week to deliver the smallest item there is and it just got delayed till next day once makes no since because its in my city it shouldn't take a week to deliver something so small and simple i would have given a better review but its taking too much time to get here so it better come tomorrow or ill leave a worse review
"Ordered package on June 4. Got to Canada on June 18. It is now July 22. Over a month in Canada? How? Pandemic? Then why is every other courier service figuring it out? And no information on the whereabouts of my package?

Honestly. I don't care if it's pandemic. Just another excuse. My biggest wonder is how my package got through China in less than 10 days. As you can imagine the amount of parcels whipping through their country right now. But Canada post can't get it to me in over a month?

And you can't even go to pick it up yourself. Which would save on shipping time, and sorting. Heck, why would they be so efficient? It's time for all the old people working there to be fired or resign. The archaic methods used are outdated. Time for some young minds to take care of business.

I just can't get over the fact that it has taken over a month in Canada. And been sitting in destination city for close to 1 month. Pathetic, to be honest"
"Well here we go again.........Canada Post parcel sent to postal sorting center near my neighborhood ( 7 days ago) .....than sent all way back to original center sorting 4 provinces away and stuck there for one week without movement. Put in a call to Canada Post support, ""sorry we have no information on your parcel, than what is seen on the tracking web site"" NOT very helpful!
Why are we still paying for this sort of service. Government of Canada you are wasting our hard earn TAX dollars. Time to do an internal AUDIT and clean house, who is accountable for the tax dollars spent on this service ???"
"Waste of tax payers money, all they do is use covid as an excuse but every other delivery service seems to be dealing with it in a reasonable amount of time"
BOYCOTT THIS COMPANY!!! They do not care about you or have made any attempt to better their situation. Don‚Äôt order from any company that uses them
This mailing survive is beyond disgusting. I mailed a package that had $100 worth of stuff inside and because I didn‚Äôt add a tracker as it was only going an hour drive away from where I live. These people lost my package and have the audacity to say that maybe I didn‚Äôt even send it. I can easily say that one of their employees stole my package and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs lost. Let me add that I mail this package in May and it‚Äôs now July and the person what was supposed to get it has yet to receive it. They are in no way helping to find my package that they lost/stole and are telling me it‚Äôs my loss. I paid $16 for these i*iots to send my package and they lose it and it my f*cken loss? I will never use Canada post again. I am very disappointed and disgusted by their services.
"Order a package from Arizona on 1 Jul and arrived in Vancouver on 6 Jul 20. It is now the 20 Jul and I have not received any information on the package.

I called the horrible customer service number on the 15th and SHOCKINGLY they have no information on my package and fed me some garbage information that I got from their website, which I will include ( I will also include the USPS tracking information). I once again called them today (20th Jul) and was fed the same BS, but this time they told me to contact the sender of my package.

When I tried to explain that my package has been sitting in limbo in Vancouver for over two weeks, I would get condescending attitude from these government employees.

It is time to get rid of this obsolete government service and rebuild it from the ground up, but until that day happens I will not be using their services.

Thank goodness for Amazon and UPS.

Scott Wilson.

"This is as low as I can rate them. I never experienced such horrible service. A parcel that's coming from 30 minutes away has not arrived yet, it's been 7 days. I will refuse to deal with any company that does business with Canada post."
Awful. What kind of garbage service is this? Even before the pandemic Canada Post has always had a problem of delivery dates. Several times I've had parcels delivered to the wrong building and the parcels are taken. And it seems every year Canada Post goes on strike to demand more money for even worse service. Government needs to disband and restart Canada Post. it's too costly compared to courier companies and they never guarantee a delivery date...
"My last eight xpress packages have been late, taking days between tracking updates, changing delivery dates to ""delivery date pending"" and then updating with delivery dates that have all been wrong. Canada Post has become completely unreliable and their tracking is now almost useless.

I issues two ""service tickets"" and received confirmation of their submissions but never anything else."
Worst customer service they don‚Äôt pick the calls. Nobody no where is my. Posts
I noticed they prioritize delivery for big contract companies like the Bay not necessarily by which item was ordered first. I waited over 2 weeks for an item from a small boutique but received items from bigger companies on time even when I ordered them much later...that‚Äôs not fair to smaller businesses that depend on CP for the survival of their business.
"Paid over $13.00 to have a small package (.279 kg) sent from Ottawa to Oshawa and 7 days later, still not delivered. I ordered 2 pairs of sandals packaged in 2 shoes boxes from England to Ottawa, paid DHL approximately $19.00 and received them in 6 days. If I could have given a 0 star, I would have. Considering the salaries they are paid, this is disgusting."
"Canada post has a thief driver handling my route in Oakville (L6m3j1) and they have refused to do anything about it. The delivery guys on my Oakville route have marked my two expensive items as delivered to my community mailbox without dropping a key in my mailbox. I contacted Canada post but I was told to get in touch with the sender. PLEASE WHAT DOES THE SENDER HAVE TO DO WITH THIS??!! I am looking for my parcels, one is a bread maker delivered on the 29th of June 2020 (nothing in the box and no key dropped either) and the other one is an international shipment of hair products worth $100 USD delivered on the 17th of June ( again, nothing delivered and no key left) . Both items were marked as delivered but I have received NOTHING!!! Canada Post has absolutely no care for their customers. They are a bunch of thieves. Amazon, DHL, and other courier services make deliveries to my place without any problems but only this CP people are the ones always saying that they have delivered my parcels without making any delivery. Customer service is rubbish, they open a ticket for you which is tossed in the trash the minute you hang up. Use other courier services if you want to get your items. I have gone to their office on Speers Road and spoken to the supervisor, manager and others but NOTHING has been done. They know the guy who stole my parcel and they're protecting him. Anyways, I have involved the police. Will come back for additional update."
"Be sure to track all your parcels almost on the daily because Canada Post takes no responsibility even tho you pay a premium to ship. Package was delivered to the wrong place but I gave it a few days to make sure it wasn't an error (given the postal issue of late) but when I realised it wasn't coming even tho marked as delivered. I contacted them and found it was a new delivery person that put it in the wrong commercial box. The manager said they would find out but after a couple days they told me that someone took it from the box and it's gone. Attempted to start ticket claim online (as per manager request). And then was told after 3 days of being delivered, it's considered as lost mail and I'm SOL. Just thought I would share this because I'm sure it happens alot. Really disappointed that A: I lost our on my money trying to deal with the manager and B: they take zero responsibility."
"Terrible delivery service. Tracking will tell you your parcel will be delivered by end of day. Nothing shows up. Next day delivery date changes to "" date pending "". All you hear is this is unprecedented times. Why is it the private delivery services have adjusted and are now providing exceptional service. Because our tax dollars are paying for this they have no motivation to improve their services. It should be eliminated. No longer a Crown corporation. I was so glad Amazon dropped them. Now I get items seven days a week and real time delivery windows. I advise all companies that sell on line to drop them and go private. I will gladly pay shipping costs for reliability and real customer service that is valued and not taken for granted."
Horrible service. Paid for 2 day shipping and it took a month to arrive. Have reduced my mail and only one package has arrived in two weeks when all are 2 day shipping. A month to get something that's paid extra for ? Funny how every other company can still do it and even early sometimes.
"Even 1 star I don't want give Canada Post!!! I have three package, all not receive. The earliest package sent out On March 12, but until now in 17 July I don't receive it. Another package send it out July 2, just 40kilometers away from my home. But15 days not receive. They're not only slow, but also careless! That is what I really worry about. The postofficer often send wrong mails to my address or send my mail to my neighbor. And You have no way to complain about it!! They shut down all! I can't imagine A big country has so bad trustless post!"
"Still waiting for packages from the UK and US. It's now been over a month and one of them was express shipping. The status only says ""Waiting for item"" and there have been no updates. Canada Post is useless. I'm beyond frustrated and have already added my information to the list for the class action lawsuit. Enough is enough. What are we even paying for?! COVID-19 should not be an excuse for this disaster."
"Never using Canada Post again. I sent a card to my Grandma with money inside and the money never got to her. One of their workers have tampered with the card (it can be seen that its been opened), took the money and sealed back the card to be delivered to her. Hope Karma gets back to whoever did that but very disappointed in Canada Post to even allow this to happen."
"Canada Post CUPW union workers refuse to deliver parcels to your door, or get within 2 meters of their customers during covid19. Therefore when you get your pickup at a postal location notice instead of your parcel, what you have to do is call them and DEMAND they pay for your parcel to be redirected to a private courier to have your item delivered to your door. IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO GET THE HOME DELIVERY YOU PAID FOR."
"Subsidized by our tax dollars, yet the absolute worst mailing service in the world.

Amazon can deliver a TV in 2 days. post Canada will take 2 weeks, if you are lucky.

They are a Canadian disgrace. Look at the reviews. 95% one star. Says a lot."
"Paid over 22$ for priority shipping to the door, waited at the door all day of delivery, but nothing. The next morning I got a delivery noticed dated for the previous day. I contacted Canada post and told some random rep. lady that I have tumor in my foot and this makes it so I can't drive. The post office the parcel was sent to is 4 miles away, I asked if they could redeliver and she said ""No, there is nothing we can do, You will have to take the slip to the post office"" Worst service ever, paid 22$ to put myself threw agonizing pain because Canada post is too lazy to drop a box by a door, wish i could give a half or zero star review. Never experience this from ANY other ""professional"" delivery service."
"I avoid Canada Post at any chance I get. The are consistently late and do not even try to deliver to the residence. They drop at a out of the way box 2km away and send message saying it was delivered. So I end up getting it at least two days later than expected.Why do I pay for delivery to the door, if not even tried by the service Provider. All other (Fedex, Loumis, UPS) deliver to the door. I see Canada post drive past the house but do not drop packages."
Useless service. If No one gets blamed for wrong actions it will continue this way.
Unfortunately I used to like Canada post but lately my shipments are being delayed more than a month and I even lost my parcel due to it disapearing mysteriously. Also the canada post mail man tried to hit on me and I felt very uncomfortable this service is suppose to uphold their quality standards but are hiring unprofessional employees.
"ordered a package on June 15th and as of July 16th I still have not received. I use their ""tracking"" which actually doesn't track correctly. I'm living in saskatchewan and the package gets taken from Manitoba past saskatchewan to montreal to then sit there for 5 days before being updates. Absolutely disgraceful service"
Wish I could give these guys Negative star their service is the worst than evey other country in the world . They never deliver on time but use exuces to steal people's money with their so called mail delivery service . They should learn from Amazon and private company what it takes to deliver on time They suck!!!!!!
"Paid for a year of mail forwarding ,,,half my mail is still going to old address. three times on hold for 45 minutes , giving up again !! what a joke"
"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, some Canada Post union reps made a statement around three weeks ago that things are finally starting to get much better and that they are expecting to be back on track within two weeks... well, here we are now. A time sensitive document that I‚Äôve mailed on June 7th to europe is still sitting somewhere in Montreal. And I‚Äôm waiting for another small packet that‚Äôs been stuck in Richmond BC since July 10 (foolishly even paid for priority shipping)

I‚Äôm just fed up with Canada Post like so many other people here. Not with the postal workers themselves. They do the best they can. But their management should be held accountable for the monumental mess they created by refusing to pay for overtime and letting the shipments pile up across the country.

Worst of all, they keep charging us premium for a nonexistent service :("
No joke. I sent out 43 packages in mid-June and its now mid-July and only 36 were received. How pathetic is that?!!
I stayed home from work to accept a couple large packages. I ordered online for a reason. I have no car. No delivery attempt was made even though I was sitting 10ft from the door all day. I was completely ready to help bring the boxes in. Instead I just get an attempted delivery notice. What a lie. I now have to drag 2 3ft tall boxes down 4 blocks from the pick up location. Thanks for being completely useless.
"I order a lot of packages from Amazon, as I work from home, and almost every single time a package is delivered by Canada Post it is late. What a waste of tax payers money. Over-paid, lazy workers."
"Your package will get stuck in Mississauga with no updates for a minimum of 2 weeks despite having ""2-day shipping"" from the seller. If you have the option to pay a couple dollars to have your package shipped with someone else, I guarantee you, it's worth it."
"I do not even want to assign one star for CP. The worst service provider ever. The staff and delivery agents are just uncourteous, ruthless scammers. I have missed all my packages from Amazon because of CP delivery agents falsely updating the information on my order as - Delivery attempted and Notice Card left - NADA. No attempt was made and no delivery notice card. I think a bunch of uneducated, illiterate people work in CP where they have no sense to make others lives easier. This is what happens when we deal with a government company. Zero service and Zero thoughts given to people problems and issues.

While the world is changing rapidly to adjust and make everyones lives easier during the Pandamic. It's CP that still wants to be primitive and unkind forever and live in a bubble. They expect a business to unlock all our building doors and risk our staffers lives of covid contact; instead of calling the admin person to give them access to the building to receive packages. Purolator, FedEx and UPS have no problems doing this. Why? Because they care and not funded by the government. Someone please talk to CP and get them do their Job. There are many other hard working lads out there who need a job and will do much better than who ever is right now.

Also, after advising a million times to a million agents to leave the packages at the closest CP and a Delivery card - yet, no sense to just follow these simple instructions. I think it is high time they get de-funded and compete in par with the private players. Someone please wake them up. They have been snoozing a lot. The rest of us still have business and real work to focus on. We can't have one lagging, lethargic system drag us down."
"21 days I've been waiting - Animals

These guys, just. suck. I cannot explain the frustration I feel towards this company. Their stupidity is truly overwhelming. I have been robbed of a computer I bought for $1500. It just disappeared. I ordered it through Best Buy, they shipped it to Canada Post, and now it has vanished off the face of the earth - apparently. No one at Canada Post can tell me where it is, the offices have told me it's probably been stolen, and suggested to buy a new one. FUTZING dipsh*ts! I used the tracking code on my phone - it said the package had been delivered three days prior to the original date. I checked my mailbox in my Apartment Lobby and nothing. NO slip, NO package, NO note. I waited - in my apartment, constantly checking the main door to see if it had been delivered, for a full week. Nothing. I called the office, they said there was a chance it had been stolen, but there's so much backup, nobody can tell. They said they'd get in contact with the driver of the truck. Then that was it. Haven't heard anything in over two weeks. SUCK A D*CK CANADA POST"
"Despicable service. I ordered a package a month ago, and not only was my delivery date pushed back 3 times, but once my package arrived at my local post office and was scheduled to arrive today, it was shipped back to a ""secure location"" 4 hours away!!!! They did not provide the reason why it was shipped there and when i call an agent to try and get answers, they say that they do not know the exact reason. So i have no idea if my package was damaged nor do i have any other informations regarding it. I asked when will i hear back from them and they said possibly in the beginning of August, 3 weeks from now !!! I am so displeased and angry with this it's really unacceptable."
"They are not less then robbers and laziest people on God's green earth , send a parcel to parcel overseas ,was returned after 1 month and and not reimbursing the cost which is 92.43 its batter use FedEx or any other courier service"
"Waiting 41 days for 1 item and 16 and counting for another that made it to the Canadian border in 10 days. Covid or not, Canada Post should be embarrassed. Time for Trudeau and friends to do an investigation and over haul of our snail mail carrier."
"Canada Post is THE worst service. This is the second item I‚Äôve been waiting for in the last month that had an estimated 14 day delivery (first one took 16 days to deliver, which isn‚Äôt awful for Canada Post) - 18 days later and I don‚Äôt even have a single update after it got in their hands! It‚Äôs likely been sitting in Mississauga collecting dust for 2 weeks, unscanned and leaving me wondering. Shipping was $10. I‚Äôd probably get it just as fast if I didn‚Äôt pay for shipping at all. They want to blame their poor service on covid but this has been happening for YEARS. The excuses are getting tiring - just admit that the service is embarrassingly slow and most of your employees aren‚Äôt properly trained/don‚Äôt care."
"They never deliver on time. My recent package was expected to come on July 3rd, which was weird because the package was shipping from montreal and I had ordered it 2 weeks before. Anyway, I waited the two weeks, it‚Äôs now July 11th and I still have not heard anything from my package, estimated date has been pending for 8 days, and the package arrived to my local Canada post on July 3rd! So it has been sitting in the office or whatever for over a week. Still waiting on my package. Can‚Äôt contact them. And not to mention every single package I have ordered from Canada post has arrived significantly late. I order with Canada post about every 2 weeks and the same thing happens every. Single. Time. If you have the option to choose a shipping courier do not pick Canada post if you want a reliable company. They are a safe company to use but they do not deliver on time. And I know with the pandemic it‚Äôs taking longer than usual but Iv‚Äôe had this problem for over 2 years now."
"Had a package done in from the states, cbsa screwed up the duties so I requested it be sent back to them for review. Instead canada post returns to sender, poorly trained employees and they just dont care, play it safe use your own courier"
Garbage. I have parcels sitting in my city Warehouse not being delivered the last three weeks. I hope you guys enjoy the class action lawsuit. Zero stars. I will never use your service again
They're the worst for updating delivery status. And not just since COVID. It's always been that way.
Do I even have to explain why this company is fu**ing garbage? If you work at CP you‚Äôre a fu**ing b@stard and need to get your damn s**t together because you work for the most useless piece of s**t company known to mankind. #F**kCanadaPost üò°
"I HATE Canada Post. Like they literally could not be worse. They are constantly leaving delivery notice cards without even knocking or trying to actually deliver your parcel. Packages CONSTANTLY arrive, yet sit in the destination city for days before actually being put on a truck. Delivery estimates, while usually ok, are still wrong WAY more often than any other shipping company. There‚Äôs just so much wrong with CP, and they don‚Äôt seem to have any interest in fixing any of it. Review after review, complaint after complaint, yet same exact nonsense year in, year out. Get it together CP. So tired of you playing games with your customers."
"I was supposed to recieve a parcel on July 6th and now when i track my item it says date pending. It's July 10th today. I was hoping to recieve my dress before my baby shower.But now i just have to go and buy another one. Even after delay i was expecting it to arrive on either 8th on 9th, but now i dont even know when i will recieve my package."
"the worst, what the hell is going on with canada post ,they went from good to the worst deliver,they blame covid which is bs because the other companay's for parcals,are consistant, what of waste of our govenerments money one word lazey and soft worker where could i apply"
"Terrible, terrible service. I understand there was a slowdown with the pandemic but several months to deliver a parcel from Ontario to Quebec??? And that's just one of many that are still out there. And forget about wasting time creating a service ticket, just few and far between automated responses. How about we DEFUND CANADA POST?"
"Like most on here, I would rate them zero stars if I could. When will we tire of having CP's nutsack on our chins. I now have to punish really decent Canadian businesses who only ship through CP by no longer doing business with them...sad really, they are hurting our economy. Canada post is knowingly and actively committing fraud by continuing to offer shippers faster more expensive shipping options which they know they stand no chance of honoring, how is this legal? For everyone else posting on here a class action lawsuit has been filed against these capitalizing fraudsters. Here's the link, I had to chop it in order to post but Google it. CP needs to be taken to the cleaners just like they have been doing to their customers for years.
lambertavocatinc/class-action-canada-post. They are seeking a total of 400$ in compensation for anyone and everyone who was sold the expedited services and failed to recieve their delivery on the guaranteed date."
I want to give them no star if I could. The service was terrible when they lie about delivering. They lied that my package wasnt delivered as the business was closed. I called the business and they said they was open at the that time and even had a person to receive and sign the package. What a shame!
"Just horrible. Their website is most often wrong, I think they make up stuff to end their shifts. Their site says that my package was delivered to my front door, I live in a condo. When I questioned, they asked if someone else could have taken it. Then they said the package was being returned to the sender, an incomplete address.So which is it?"
"Canada Post is all about covid slowdown. Every other service on the planet is about giving the same service in spite of covid. Many eBay sellers who ship to Zimbabwe will not ship to canaduh due to the horrendously bad service from cp. Please Zimbabwe, start a mail service in canaduh."
"****** EXCELLENT SERVICE *****

I sent an express post to my daughter who lives in Germany. To my amazement arrived today only 3 business days.

Thank you Canada Post will be using you again and again ."
"If I could give this service zero stars, then I would surely do so. All I can say is that an important client sent a package using Xpresspost which took 16 days to get to me. I am totally disgusted with this company. They haven't navigated the COVID-19 crisis well at all."
I wish I could give this place a ZERO PLEASE NEVER USE THIS Piece of CRAP!!!! they need to be shutdown this place needs to be closed and run out of business. This is probably all cuz of the prime minster. My hate for Canada has rose since using this horrible service. This is sad and annoying. I am so frustrated and irritated. I truly hope you run out of business because you deserve nothing.
"Horrible postal service. Started fresh with a business partner who is in Canada. He sent me samples the first time, untracked. Never arrived. Next one, hey let's send it tracked with the note that delivery is 6-10 business days. Send on June 10th, it had a status update on June 26th that it has been 'fright forwarded to destination country' meaning that they needed 16 days (non business days) already only to get it on the airplane...... It's July 8th and I called my local post and it still hasn't arrived. That must mean lost as it takes max 1 day to fly the package to the destination.... I tried to call them, don't even bother... Can't get through.

Update - One arrived after 4 months. (first package). 2nd one still missing in action. Just wanted to update but the rating stays the same: 1star."
"Came home in the evening to a package on my front step (luckily no one stole it), but I didn't order anything. Address was wrong, the House number was correct but the street was incorrect and about 5 blocks away. Didn't want to go through the hassle of having to deal with them and dropped it off myself to the correct address."
Just terrible. No attempt is even made to try and deliver to door. Straight to pick up. Why do they even exist anymore?
"Our mail carrier takes every second or third package back to the post office for ""address verification"" due to incorrect postal code - the postal code we use is the same on every package, same as our neighbours and is the same one Canada post's website spits out for our building.

My last package was shipped USPS to Canada post - 2 days from California to Vancouver and then over 3 weeks to get scanned into Canada post's system from there.

Amazon can deliver a package in a few hours but the service that everyone in our country pays for is this ridiculously bad? Someone please clean house and get some people in who know what they're doing."
"If u wish for your mail to travel a 2 hour drive and take over a month to arrive without any notice to why from staff or whr your package is even tho it has tracking,, then use this service. I will NEVER be on board with this company again they are ridiculous"
Very very slow service. Waiting 45 min outside wirh 5 people in saint jean. Boul st luc
"I would rate them a zero if it was possible. This is what happens when a government attempts to try and run a business. Three packages sent out at the same time to the same address. One arrived 4 days late, one has been stuck in the destination city for 3 days and one has not yet left the origin city. All packages sent out 16 days ago."
"Canada post has the worst service, i sent an item as express and i paid 7 times more than regular delivery they mentioned that express usually take 24hours, i expected the worst case which is 48 hours, i want the item to be delivered on time because the recipient is travelling abroad. Trust me it took a week to deliver the item and when i called canada post to complain the customer care guy told me express now is only to get a tracking number. They charge me 7 times more for a tracking number. They use Covid 19 as excuse for their bad service. I told them i need the item back because no one will be available to receive it. He said we cannot track the item location once it leaves our facility and it should be delivered. Who care about a tracking number if they cannot track their item location and deliver on time."
"Recently (2020):
Let's start with the BIG problems as of late.

- They offer PRIORITY, next-day guaranteed delivery, but you won't see your parcel for a week or two, even if it's only moving within the GTA.

- They won't honor the guaranteed delivery or refund, despite priority shipping being significantly more expensive than XpressPost

- Priority 'guaranteed' service should NOT be offered if it cannot be honored. It's false advertising

- Several (3+) XpressPost shipments moving locally within the GTA have taken between 3-5 weeks to deliver, despite being close enough to pick up in person (if it were available).

Previously (<2020):
Several years ago, Canada Post would almost always (80+%) mark parcels as ""delivered"" a day or two before they actually showed up, to superficially boost on-time numbers. They have not done this in the last couple years. Not sure if they got in trouble for it, but I much prefer the honesty of shipments being late, rather than wondering if it was misdelivered.

The ONLY reason they don't get 1 star is because in all the years, and hundreds of parcels I've had shipped with them, only 1 has been permanently lost... which is pretty incredible."
Left a package worth over $600.00 next to the front door when nobody was home. Also came a week late.
"Every other delivery service imaginable can deliver on time to my door EXCEPT for Canada Post, which has had my order for over a month. Coming from Mississauga to Collingwood, Ontario. Ends up in Winnepeg and I still don't have my item. LAUGHABLE. Will be making the effort to only make my online purchases that use a different delivery option than Canada Post. What a Shame!!"
"Canada Post's service is really sucking badly, and was bad even before Covid-19, and they don't even seem to care that their service is so bad. Last year on June 5, I ordered a pendant from an eBay seller in China, and not only has it not arrived, more than a year later, but even the replacement hasn't arrived. And this year, I ordered books from two different Australian eBay sellers, and the books are now almost 12 weeks late! In my neighborhood, we only see the mail man once, maximum twice, a week, and usually the deliveries are nothing but junk mail. Canada Post needs to strive to be more like Amazon's delivery (you don't end up waiting more than a year for deliveries from them, that's for sure). And I get that there's been an uptick of online buying due to Covid-19, but like I said, service was bad before Covid-19. If Canada Post is so grossly understaffed, they need to hire more people!"
"There are some serious problems with this service with no accountability. They were bad before COVID but during COVID where all companies have a chance to prove that they are the best, Canada post just proved they are the absolute worst. They don‚Äôt even deliver mail on certain days and packages are always on the way to you but takes 10 days to actually arrive. Estimated dates are 2 weeks late and there is no accountability. I am actually annoyed that companies continue to use them for shipping when they can‚Äôt ever deliver anything on time. Instead of setting standards they are showing Canada that tax payers money is wasted."
"Canada Post is an obsolete, archaic and incredibly inefficient waste of taxpayer dollars. Currently I am tracking a package that sat for 10 days in Mississauga due to ""missed cut off time"". So cut off time is essentially two weeks for an expedited parcel?
What a joke.
Is there any wonder why 95% of reviews are 1 star? Give the option to have zero, and youur average would drop even less.
People crying to disband the police? Hell, disband Canada Post first!"
Canada post is very slow they are always complaining that they are swamp like Christmas just deliver the mail and packages that's your job and stop complaining. You guys canada post are the only company crying like baby that you are swamp.
Terrible service always disappointing.late delivery.no updates for tracking.3 day‚Äôs delivery takes more then a week.
"If i could pick zero as a rating, I would. Absolutely terrible service, they should have been out of business years ago."
"Slow, No accountability, bad customer service. Just the worst all around. Don't ever trust them to drop your package off on time. If you call to complain, there will always be an excuse on their end. ""Extreme weather delays"", ""Higher than normal order numbers"", it's all fine until they use an excuse like that every time. They take zero responsibility for their wrong doings, and their customer service is curt, rude and unhelpful.

Whenever I order something, I try my hardest to avoid purchasing any item with Canada post shipping. As you can see, the reviews are all of the same nature, yet they don't ever do anything to change. Maybe if these bad reviews pile up enough they'll one day not care."
"Canada Post is literally the worst Delivery Company. I sat at home waiting all day. Then I get a email saying delivery was attempted and to look for a delivery notice.
I go downstairs of my condo building. Look inside my mailbox and yep there's a delivery notice.
Delivery guy was to lazy to put my parcel into a parcel lock box we have in our Condo Building yet he had time to put a delivery notice in mail box. And he was to lazy to come upstairs to even knock on my door to deliver my package.
I won't ever use Canada Post Ever again."
"I desperately need the diabetic supplies I ordered for my little dog. The US side gets them to the border asap and custom clears them and they get get into the hands of Canada Post that's where it all goes down hill fast ! When I check with CP I am told they are being held at customs..only tracking say my package cleared customs 9 days ago ! I am rationing test strips now and was almost out. So I was forced to spent $100 at a pharmacy to get 100 strips to tie me over until my package is delivered. I went through half of the 100 already and still no package ! I payed a lot of money for my supplies, shipping and duty and now had to spend another $100 due to how pathetic slow they are ? My dog is in danger because of them ! They have no issue delivering junk mail though ! What are they doing with my package of medical supplies ? Furious ! We have the worst postal service in Canada ! No excuse in the year 2020..they need to get with it ! CP is dinosaur and yet they think they can get away with outrageous prices for shipping etc.. ! Horrific service. Hey CP how about working on Saturday and with longer hours to get the job done ! You charge enough for shipping so make it worth the price you charge ! I have two more of the same supplies ordered ( had to order double due to how long I have to wait to prevent rationing life saving supplies ) guess I have to wait well over a month and a half to get them too !"
Order was placed on May 19th. Just arrived today. According to the website the staff sorted it incorrectly and it had to be rerouted. I had to then go pick it up on the other side of the city. I was told to have ID not proof of adddress. Thankfully our vehicle insurance cards were in the vehicle. The staff was rude because I had to go get the cards. I‚Äôll be shipping through UPS from here on in. Not happy!
"It's a disgrace and i really have no clue why nobody has started up a class action lawsuit yet. Generally, when companies expect more business than usual, they will hire more people. What decent company uses the excuse of ""we're to busy"" to explain their lack of customer service. At this point i'll just pay the extra $20 to go with any other courier."
"I spent $12 to send an important letter to Ottawa from Stoney Creek on June 25/20! It's now July 6th & the letter is somewhere in Ottawa!

Canada Post online Chat is totally inadequate, there isn't anyone there, you just put the tracking # in all over again!

I'm being harrassed by the person on the receiving end! I just don't need this stress!

NEVER AGAIN will I trust Canada Trust with important documents!

What drives me insane is that I paid them for this extra service, foolish me!

Buyer Beware!"
"Canada Post has very POOR customer service and has NO knowledge of how to do any problem-solving. Every company including Canada Post is using ""Covid-19"" as an excuse for such massive delays, yet this company does not post such communication on its website.

I have sent out two essential parcels to the United Kingdom, still has not arrived at the destination. Every employee I spoke to uses the term ""Unfortunately I do not have that information."" What are these employees even good for...There is no sense of urgency and my essential parcels have been missing for just over two months now!

To everyone else, please do not use Canada Post as your primary mailing service. Complete waste of time!"
"Very disgusting service, my orders take months to come in and i am left in the dark as to where they are or what is happening. It feels like i buy stuff and am left with dust in my hands. Oh and dont try to call them cause you‚Äôll be talking to their crap robot. Most frustrating part is that i pay priority shipping and it takes fewer days for my orders to get to canada but months to get from a few hours away to my house. I am very relieved to see that i am not the only one to be a victim of this nasty rubbish service."
"Do your job if you are able to do it
Do your job if you are able to do it. On the contrary, quit it
It's funny to hear the excuse of the pandemic situation to offer a ridiculous service...

On June 10th I purchased my item on Amazon.com from the US, and it arrived via PitneyBowes to CanadaPost facility in Mississauga in less than 4 days!
Wait! No pandemic problem for them?! It's very strange...

Since June 15th (with cleared customs) my item has been stuck somewhere at their facility, and it's still marked as ""In transit"" with ""date pending"".
They want neither to deliver it, nor allow me to pick it up in person!

And in this absurd situation, I spent money to have nothing in my hands!
If you are not able to handle your job when difficulties appear, quit it and look for something different on Indeed.ca or Jobbank.gc.ca.

[UPDATE - Sunday June 28th, 4:15 pm]
What a funny story!
My cousin, who lives with me at the same address, has ordered an item on Friday, so two days ago.
Today, a few minutes ago, he received a CanadaPost email saying his item has been delivered!
Are you joking?!?!?!

---

[UPDATE - Sunday June 28th, 9:19 pm]
Now you're using the pathetic excuse of the pandemic situation.
But in the 2017 what did you use as an excuse?
Folks, google ""calgary canada post delay 2017""...

Do you know what's the truth? That, as I said before, you should look for a different job position because you are not fit to be in this kind of business!
Shame you!

---

[UPDATE - Wednesday July 1st, 10:07 pm]
On Amazon it has appeared a new delay date: July 2nd-9th...
You are the worst thing that could ever happen, much worse than covid, or ebola, or any other $h*t like these ones.
I hope you fail as soon as possible.

---

[UPDATE - Thursday July 2nd, 07:00 pm]
After contacting one more time both Amazon.com and Canada Post, at 7pm I have found out an update on their site (no one sent me an email to let me know...).
Now, the item seems to be really ""in transit"" and it's located in Scarborough.
The expected delivery is set for tomorrow. Is going to happen for real? After ""just"" 24 business days?
Time will tell... *fingers crossed*

---

[UPDATE - Friday July 3rd, 11:47 am]
Yes, my friends! After ""only"" 24 and more business days my item has been delivered!
Good luck because, due to Canada Post poor delivery service, we all need a lot of lucky with our parcels."
"Sending post from the UK to Canada has been such a stress for us. Hardly any have reached their destination, including tracked parcels. I've lost a lot of money through lost stock and refunds. I've made the hard decision to stop selling to Canadian customers solely due to Canada Post's unprofessionalism."
How long does it take Canada post to get a small parcel from lemington ont to Windsor ont . It's been a week and still not arrived. Very bad service.
Two of my package both say ‚Äúdelivered to recipient‚Äôs front door‚Äù but there is nothing. I was home all day and no one even came. I waited and checked around the house and there is nothing. My senders already submitted a ticket A MONTH AGO and there is still no updates! I contacted customer service multiple times and not only they are rude but they are not helping at all. This is very upsetting as I have lost over $100+ now.
Canada Post is broken and they don't tell you when you ship that your parcel may never arrive. UPS Ground delivers before Canada Post Priority.
"My friend and I both ordered a package from the same seller on April 24th. She lives in a different country and got it within a week. I live in Canada, the package arrived at the Canadian border within a week. It is now July 4th and I still don't have it. I'm going to China for a job when the borders open up. I bet I would get the package faster if I fly to China myself after borders open months from now and drive from the airport to the seller.

Canada Post wasn't the best before. They're a scam now. What else do you call a company that takes your money AND belongings for a fake service that never happens? They've stolen three of my packages now."
"Delivery keeps getting delayed and delayed. Pending delivery. Delivery due tomorrow, then the next day, then the next. Hasn't arrived yet. The parcel was shipped from Brampton. It arrived in Mississauga's sorting facility. Out for delivery. Still hasn't arrived. Delivery due another day again, then then next day. If they allow pickup, I'll go there and pick it up myself within 30 minutes!"
"Canada Post, How is it possible to have no tracking updates,on shipped items. On route, date pending since June 22,
Where the hell,(is your reasonable effort) to deliver products already paid for....on time?
Better yet explanation given, After July 3 delivery at the end of day......Was received by Canada Post, after cut-off time.?

You lying sac's, of human feces...!
3 parcels now (missing but guaranteed),
Still in transit..."
"Waiting over a mth now for a package...this is completely unacceptable! This pandemic will cause some delays, but this is not even close to being acceptable. No updates... nothing..."
"Worse customer service I have ever dealt with, very unprofessional, disrespectful and even disturbing a company such as Canada Post would allow so called supervisor to speak like the way I was spoken to. A very small issue turned into a nightmare because of poor customer service."
"Tracking says out for delivery since 10am,lol. Its 7:30pm, must of took it sight seeing."
"The worst delivery company in Canada. The package is always in Mississauga and pending delivery. The expected delivery date is a lie, the real delivery date is the given expected delivery date plus one week to one month."
its very slow to be delivered and they're always pending when the order will be coming. I still haven't gotten my order and it has been 3 weeks since I have ordered.
"Canada Post made mistakes more than once. My important documents had to be sent to Mexico a few months ago, but they sent to Morocco. How ridiculous?? This time they lost my oven that bestbuy sent to me. Why do this such inefficient companies still exist? As a postal officer, they should have a strong sense of responsibility because customers trust you. The service is so disappointing, and unforgivable!!"
"I grew up in a third world country and the postal service there is better than Canada Post. They are literally killing my small business with their incompetence. Who do I send my lost revenue bills to? If I ran my business like Canada Post runs theirs, I‚Äôd be on welfare. If you have ANY other options for shipping and receiving, use them. Canada Post is absolute garbage."
"I have written on here before. But this one is for the books. My parcel crossed the border from the U.S. into Canada. It took 3 days to reach there from China. On June 8 it cleared customs and was in the hands of Canada Post. It then when back to the U.S. and re-entered Canada on June 9, cleared customs again and landed in the hands of Canada Post. It is now touring Canada. This parcel has seen more of Canada then I have. This is all according to their tracking which is run by monkeys playing on the keyboard. Give it up people. You are never going to receive your packages. I have 3 missing and no one knows where they are. Bet they know where there paycheck is though."
"Canada post is an unprofessional organization. If I would have a chance I would never use it. They change the delivery date all the time. The item could travel through all country, even if it has to be delivered from Mississauga to Toronto. It could stay at their facilities forever. My item left Mississauga two weeks ago, and I‚Äôm still waiting it in Etobicoke. Originally it had to come on Tuesday last week and today is already Friday next week and they still pending delivery date... What is going on? I need my item before next week. And now I‚Äôm afraid if I ever will receive it before summer ends... Never use Canada Post if you have any other options!!!"
"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Seems to be the same issue everyone faces. Item arrived in Mississauga June 26 with no further updates. The delivery date has come and gone with no update provided, the status briefly changed to delivery in progress and has now changed back to item in transit. Canada post is disgusting and need to be held accountable for their lack of customer service. Thanks for ruining my 10 year old sons birthday!!!!"
"I am now also a member of the pretigous hate Canada Post club. I ordered from the US and was a bit anxious given Covid. Items got to the border within days and were cleared to cross at the beginning of June. Canada Post has had them in their hands now for a month. One package was to be delivered on the 30th and then when it of course wasnt was to come today. Nope. The other is in limbo. Another package arrived in mississauga 2 weeks ago (where i live) but was shipped to Richmond BC for a week. I am not a logistician but i am not sure why--when a package is 10km from its destination--it needs to go thousands of kilometers away for ""processing"". There is no customer service other than auto help which we all know equals no help. I'm trying to understand how a government operated company gets away w this when its citizens pay for their existence. I'm sending them my therapist's bills bc this has made me crazy."
"We purchased an item online it took 58 days to get delivered to Stoney Creek. Tracking shows delivered but we never received anything. We suspect that the key was misplaced in the wrong community box.
In any event we never got our items and no one will bear any responsibility. I have said this for year CP should be run as a business to generate a profit and not loss. In private business you are held accountable and have to compete in a global market or you are out of job. Government jobs are not held accountable or competitive in a global market. We as taxpayer continue to pay for poor service. Good Luck trying to speak to those yahoo,s over the matter. Trying to contact anyone is pretty well a waste of time. Brutal system."
"Absolutely terrible service. Item was 2 weeks delayed. Finally started moving one day and immediately said ""Notice card left"". There was no card. Called to inquire and system DOES NOT work (giving options but unable to select???). It is too bad this is a Crown Corp. Should not be a business at all."
Canada post is the worst. My experience much like the others I am reading is terrible. I got a package from the US sent and cleared through customs from Pitney Bowes is 4 days and now it‚Äôs been sitting in the Mississauga Canada post warehouse since June 9th. They keep blaming the delays and the backlog of packages I have called so many times. The package is in transit they tell me. And have been telling me for weeks now yet no new scans. Won‚Äôt let me pick it up. We can‚Äôt tell you any new information. And yet ordered something else two days ago went to the same warehouse and is now in transit for today. After two days and yet you can‚Äôt deliver a package that‚Äôs been sitting there for over three weeks. They really need to re evaluated there system because it‚Äôs clearly not working.
Same situation while the world adjusts to new protocols around doing business Canada Post is using this pandemic to do their jobs even slower. Package shipped from Washington to Vancouver in 3 days time diverted to Mississauga for Toronto location has been on delivery status since June 14 !@!! Still no package are they pushing the truck or what. Terrible Terrible service even worse customer service.
"Terrible service! Mailed an EXPRESS prepaid letter from GTA to downtown Toronto. Literally 30 minutes drive away. A week later, the tracker is saying that my envelope was ""re-routed due to a processing error"", and has been sitting in Scarborough for a week. This was an urgent document, and due to COVID I was told that no-one was in the office to accept a courier letter, and I HAD to use Canada Post. How difficult is it to deliver a document 30 minutes away? Disgusting service."
"pathetic. 2 days the packet is out for delivery and doesnt deliver. i dont understand when the status says out for delivery, is the postman taken the packet and kept in his vehicle. or what........frustrating.......... worst postal company in the world."
"Canada post is the only company in the world who can manage to take 3 weeks to ship a small parcel 60km with zero tracking updates. I could have walked there and back 10 times for god sakes. Its time for canada post to be put out of its misery. Pathetic excuse for a company, and dont try and blame COVID, everyone else is still getting their jobs done!"
"This lesson taught me never use Canada Post again for INTERNATIONAL PARCEL delivery. I ordered a product from certain company on March 27, 2020. The estimated delivery date was supposed to be May 6, 2020. For over 3 months, their Tracking Website is still saying, ""The sender has created a shipping label. When we process the item, we'll update its status and expected delivery date. ***Our call centre agents have no more information about your item."" How am I suppose to find out what happens to my package? It makes me only think Canada Post have either lost or stolen my package !!!"
"Question: [""why did this package sit for 9 hours in Richmond and then for another 8 hours in Victoria ? And now waiting in Victoria all day and tonight and tomorrow too ?? What's going on ? Hardly worth paying almost $25 for !!"",""It has to cross from Swartz Bay to Pender Island post office to be scanned before delivery. Their post office has limited hours now and no delivery or scanning will be possible until Thursday. That is not XPRESSPOST delivery !!"",""Direct to door delivery is not a possibility on Pender Island. I am still very unhappy and think Canada Post should apologize to me.""]"
"Canada Post has my package in the same city that I live in for over a week now. They won't let me pick it up and they told me that if they don't deliver it in the next week they will do something about it. I am still working, my boss will not let me take weeks to do something that should take hours."
They lied about trying to deliver my package. I was at home all day but they said they missed me. Now I have to go pick it up.
"I pointlessly paid for express delivery, only to have the expected delivery date to pass by a week ago. To rub salt in the wounds, according to the tracking, my parcel has gone past my residence to get to the local facility that then has been 'processing' it for days on end. Never experienced such a terrible delivery service. Avoid at all costs"
"Unionized and greatly inferior to other, privatized, couriers."
"I HATE CANADA POST

Even before COvid 19 Canada Post had an endless list of excuses as to why they offer all around AWFUL service. The pandemic is just another excuse
thrown on top of a moutain of crap to justify why they cant seem to do a simple job of deliverng a parcel from point A to B.
From my experience CP offers:
EXTREEEEMLY SLOW SERVICE (consistentaly rated as one of the slowest in the world-(even before Covid delays).
INSANELY HIGH SHIPPING COSTS (volume of letters and parcels are falling over the years yet prices keep going up-ridicules inflated domestic costs.
frequent problems with Scanning mail.
ridiculous strikes (maybe soon ""delivery"" will resort to tossing your mail out the truck window as they drive by).
SHADY INSURANCE CLAIMS ""PROCEDURES""
I have also experienced them prematurely marking packages as ""delivered"" when in fact no such attempts were made until days later.
The list goes on..

To illustrate my frustration: A package i sent out has been lost for 2 months now.
I paid for insurance and tracking (as i always do) just to see that there have been no tracking updates since the first day it was scanned into the system.
A Rep at CanadaPost says that they are seeing more mail not being scanned at transit points due to COvid-19....okay..so why am i paying for tracked service to not recieve said service?
So i Opened up a service ticket as it has been two months now with no scans and reciever has not gotten it- so likely lost in transit.
Canada post wont pay me for the covered lost contents inside (of which i paid insurance to have covered) until they hear from the reciever.
WHy the hell is Canada Post putting the the onus on the reciever to proove it was never delivered?! we can all clearly see based on the tracking that it
is floating around in no man's land and has not been delivered! This should be evidence enough!
INSURANE CLAIMS: There is a carefully designed loophole to prevent Canada post from having to pay ppl for missing items and be held ACCOUNTABLE for
their crap service. Canada post will drag out their ""investigation"" process soo long that it forces you to refund the reciever out of pocket.
The dilema being that once the reciever has been refunded they have no incentive to follow up with canada Post and without ""confirmation from the reciever"" CP refuse's to refund.
They have closed my service tickets TWICE on the account that they havent ""heard"" from the receiver.
I PAID for insurance should it go missing. I PAID to have this delivered. No way this kind of practice would fly in any other service-base industry!"
"Oh well, I see so many people here blaming Canadapost I felt better now... Shame on Canadapost disapointing to Canadian bad management."
Snails-pace. 5 days and waiting on 2-day Xpresspost. Over 7 days for regular post from the neighbouring city. Huge delay. Find another courier.
This is outrageous! A package for a newborn baby sitting in a Mississauga Canada Post office now for 8 days. The worst service I have ever seen from Canada Post.
"Chose express option on June 15th, should be around 2 days. Said it was going to be delivered June 17th, cool. It's June 29th now, what is going on? All their agents are busy? How is that possible? The pandemic will cause delays of course, but this is clearly incompetence."
"These guys are borderline useless and create their own problems. Parcels are so late I file a 'lost in post declaration' blaming the shipper, or assume something is lost, and have a replacement sent. Meanwhile, the original is probably still in the stream with Canada Post and another one now adding to the back log because the replacement for the first one has shipped. It was bad before Covid, now its an epic failure. Weird how the other shippers seem to have figured it out but Canada Post has endless excuses."
I wish If there was 0 stars... Probably the slowest post in the world. Even small package from same province you need to wait for month.
"I‚Äôd give 0 stars if possible. Canada Post vandalized my package and stole our merchandise. I am devastated. Your service is awful and you have THIEVES working there. Such a shame....

Please do not use Canada Post service if you value your merchandise."
"I wish I could rate 0 stars. Using covid as an excuse when their service has been garbage for years. Every other delivery service on the face of the planet is managing covid just fine, it's only CP that seems to have issues. It's so bad that certain places won't even ship to Canada anymore. Scamming their customers for expedited shipping then not providing the service. Been waiting three weeks for 2 day shipping. My package finally went out for delivery on Friday, then it was delayed until ""next business day"". Now that it's Monday I guess they decided they just don't want to bother delivering it because now it's just sitting in the depot instead of in the truck out for delivery. When I contacted customer service they didn't even let me explain the problem and disconnected. Joke of a company, incompetent employees and management, just a huge mess."
they said they tried to drop it off at the door and lied
"Waiting...forever...my mail only gets delivered maybe twice a week at home. Sometimes I will see the delivery vehicle on a Sunday..
.but not Monday to Friday at all... might want to adjust those ""expected delivery"" timeliness... apparently by the end of the day means....by the end of a day....someday.
Poor service. Poor attitude....pay the money use Canpar or anyone else."
They accepted the package and it missed its delivery date four times while the origin and destination were in the same city. I understand delays can happen because of Covid-19 but if their capacity is capped they should not accept new packages until they take care of the old ones. Accepting beyond capability and then delaying it over and over again is not acceptable. How come other delivery companies don't have this problem? UPS told me it may have up to two days delay and then delivered with only one day delay. Canada post said I should expect delays then went on missing its own designated delivery date again and again. They just had to deliver it from east of the city to west and could not even manage that properly.
"If you want to see the worst of Canada Post, go to the Grand Valley, Ontario outlet. The woman who works there is a vile, abusive person who deserves to be unemployed. What a f#&%ing misfit"
"The waiting time is now just RIDICULOUS, I am waiting for parcels ordered on April; I was able to track them as long as they were in the country of origin. Now, 4 months later and Canada post STILL CANNOT provide tracking information. They were terrible before the pandemic (not knocking on door to deliver, just placing parcels outside on the rain or to be easily picked up by any-who) but now..."
Can anybody explain to me how a parcel can be out for delivery for 2 days. Is it in the delivery vehicle overnight? Is Canada Post feeding us disinformation? Also how come parcels go around the country and back and forth between facilities before they arrive at the destination? Are they collecting bonus miles or something? Just asking?
Express post is no longer express post. I am waiting on important documents. The sender Paid a premium to have them sent by express post. It's been 6 days for 2 day service. The tracking notice has said DATE PENDING for 4 days. The online tracking says it's processing. The virtual assistant says the same thing. And when I ask to chat with a support staff it crashes. When I call the 800 number the recorded message says support staff have no more information than the website. What a complete failure. You have one job. Delivery. On time. Letters are sorted by machines. COVID 19 is not an excuse to fail when the work is automated.
"What is going on
It says :
""Item arrived
Montreal, QC"" since June 19
It's a Package that need a signature, need to stay home in case they decide to arrive.
No news, its june 29 today

Edit : July 2, no news"
"Driver didn't even attempt to deliver package. Just left notice that nobody was home and drove away. I had PPE ready so I could sign for delivery and the driver would be at minimum risk. Important item I paid extra for express delivery and now I have to wait to the end of the day to pick it up at the post office. I've had this or other mishaps happen multiple times with Canada Post. When ever I have the option FedEx or DHL is my go to because they will actually ring the doorbell and wait a fair time before leaving. Absolutely garbage service, thanks Canada Post for the same low consistency. Your drivers just want to get in and out as fast as possible and could care less about actually doing their job properly."
"Bought a pair of vintage pants from ebay and was supposed to get them last week. Contacted eBay, told them that I didn't get my item, checked both cp and USPS, with the tracking numbers, no information comes up on the databases and yet I get ebay notifications saying that the item has shipped and with the carrier. Which carrier is it cp or USPS, idk. Meanwhile ebay is looking into this issue, and yes it seems like cp is using covid as an excuse for everything. Waiting every day for the mail to show up between 11 and 2 to no avail. Looks like I'll be getting a refund on the pants, so I doubt ill ever get them. I also had another issue with another ebay seller and an amazon item that so called got lost. No wonder why ebay sellers dislike shipping to CanadaStay tuned for the seller's response

Hi Vance,

We're sorry to hear that you didn't receive the item you purchased. Your request is open, and we've asked the seller to respond and resolve your issue by Jul 3, 2020.

If you don't hear back or can't work something out, you can ask us to step in beginning Jul 3, 2020. If that happens, we'll review your request, gather any new info we need, and make a decision within 48 hours"
"Horrible support teams. Completely useless for any information I ALREADY know. Buddy orders parcel from BC, gets it in 4 days. I order a parcel from within my province and see it hasn't moved in two weeks...?? Can't load to track another parcel, that I got an email Friday, stating out for delivery at 7:45 am. By 12:30 pm, I get another email stating it was rescheduled for delivery the next business day. Now i cant track it at all and niether can your support team. Their answer, "" Well it goes back and takes a few days to reprocess"". What the heck?? It WAS already processed, out for delivery, in my mailbox no less, when SuzieQ decides she doesn't want to deliver it, and she WAS here delivering mail to other tenants. You guys are USELESS when you claim you're a *support team* BTW, you've failed before and I just let it go. Not this time! One more thing, stop using COVID 19 as an excuse, as we are all well aware of that and have been patient in most cases. Not this time!"
This one of the worst deliverys my order is 1 month now i don't know what the hell they doing with it and the customers service is useless they literally don't know any thing more than you do or do any thing about your delivery so what the f..k is the customer service for i just dont get it on the there website it says they dont any thing more than you or somebody so they completely forgot about the purpose of customer service how is a person who dont any s..t about the delivery than i do or cant even do any thing about it so htw is he gona help me its just dumb and how the f..k do delivery to another address you literally have one job delivery to f..kn address given to you notwhere ever you want
"I ordered something over two weeks ago and it was supposed to be delivered last week. They kept changing the date of delivery everyday. When I went to check it again , the update said that they were having a problem finding the address. Which to be honest anyone with half a brain cell could punch into the gps and delivery it. I called the customer service line and the man working the desk literally sound like he was 100 years old. I'm disappointed with the service and this is why people would rather go with FedEx or UPS because they actually get the job done."
"I ordered an expensive electronics item from Amazon and it was sent via Canada Post. Canada Post tracking service indicates it was received at their Richmond BC facility on June June 11 (from Amazon US facility, it seems). Then departed Richmond BC on June 11 and arrived to Canada Post in Mississauga on June 14 at 1:51am. There is no further tracking information. (It seems theft by a Canada Post worker may be an explanation?) It has been decades of under-performance and I've lived in several countries over the past few decades to compare. No country has a postal system as slow, under-performing (failure or delay in delivery) or as expensive as Canada. Amazon, please stop using Canada Post."
Please don‚Äôt post your important things with Canada post. It‚Äôs been two weeks my mom has sent my passport and I still haven‚Äôt receive it yet. I had to change my flight and paying a lot of penalties. Canada post is always a joke. They don‚Äôt work and blaming COVID 19 üòÇ lazy people go stay at home and don‚Äôt work bring new staff stronger and change your service.
I ordered a package 4 weeks ago. Tracked my package for four weeks for them to say package was delivered successfully but did not receive anything. Canada Post is a joke.
It‚Äôs a shame Amazon uses Canada Post. They screw up my shipment every single time. Third party vendors that use UPS or Fedex always get it right. OMG what are you doing Canada Post? I hate to say this but we have to put them out of business so they learn their lesson.
I've had products ordered from a warehouse 20 minutes away from my house and they've somehow shipped it to a different province on multiple occasions. Not sure how they so consistently manage to do it.
"Awful tracking. And don't forget the actual awful delivery dates. I understand due to Covid that business is more difficult, however the total lack of regard for the customers paying extra or even expecting packages within a certain date range is ridiculous. I can't even trust that you'll deliver it by the suggested ""latest delivery date"" with all the misplacement of packages and late delivery"
"Canadapost lacks service, no accountability , they luv this covid thing , more excuses for them not to do there job."
I had ordered a package from TSC it took 2 weeks to arrive at the plant in Dieppe which is only 2 hours from my house it took 13 days to arrive from Dieppe NB to Fredericton NB
"every package that has been handed over to Canada Post has either been lost or delayed for months with no tracking information why is it that every other courier service has gotten their acts together and are able to get packages out on a timely manner but everyone that's been handed over to Canada Post is either lost delayed for months and you can't find any information on them whatsoever what the hell is going on with Canada Post they have failed miserably servicing their customers through covid 19 where every other business has gotten their acts together through this pandemic and are giving their customers good service no excuse I am really sick of my packages being lost or delayed for months with no tracking information available,and trying to speak to somebody or even post a complaint online on their web page is absolutely ridiculous. Canada post get your damn acts together and stop using the pandemic as an excuse for your s***** service no other courier service is having delays like you are it's absolutely asinine when things are sitting in Mississauga or Kitchener for weeks on end get it together man people pay for service and you are not delivering your service you can't even get a hold of you to complain it's b******* and it's unacceptable get it together and stop using what's happening in the world as an excuse no other company that delivers parcels or mail are giving a horrible service like Canada Post you people are an absolute rip off ridiculous organization and I have to laugh because it seems Amazon is no longer handing their parcels over to you as you've lost every one of my parcels from Amazon that have been handed to you and I'm happy to say none of my parcels from Amazon have been delivered by Canada Post anymore they're using different courier services or they're delivering the parcels themselves once again why are you the only ones failing in this industry miserably failing I might add get it together man"
"I got my package in time, but after reading these reviews, they dont deserve anything more than 1 stars. They have a problem with doing their main job, sending out mail and packages. They also have a problem with dealing with costumers. I wouldnt ship with them, because i feel like i got lucky instead of good service."
"I had a package sent to me on the 15th of June by USPS everything was fine with my package until it got into the possession of Canada post. The status is saying delivered and I went to my mailbox, no package, no nothing. This is the second consecutive time this has happened with Canada post in a few months. Ridiculous!!!!!!! Last time I was lucky enough to have my neighbour bring my package which was incorrectly delivered to them and now in this instance I don‚Äôt even know if someone will actually locate my package and deliver it. Totally unacceptable. The customer service reps are not liable for a lost package but miss me with the routine BS about opening a ticket. Reading verbatim processes is not an ANSWER as to why couriers from Canada post cannot get things right. I HATE CANADA POST!...Thing is, I didn‚Äôt even CHOOSE them to deliver my package but apparently some packages have to be handled by them, I think Canada post is a big rip off. Either that or couriers are just deliberately placing packages somewhere else or just maybe keeping the items. We need answers CANADA POST! Don‚Äôt you guys have logs of which person handles which deliveries on a particular day? Gotta do better than this."
"My package was supposed to arrive last Tuesday however it was delayed until today. I was expecting the package today but it was delayed again due to an error on their part, so now I have to wait until next Monday to get my package because they don't work on weekends. I tried contacting them about the issue but they won't even speak to you if your package isn't late by at least 21 days. I can understand some delays due to increased volume during the pandemic however all other companies seem to be actually capable of delivering their packages on the date that they give despite the current situation. Do not trust these people, your package will not arrive on the date they give."
"My parcel left Toronto and arrived in Kitchener in 4 hours. It was in transit from Kitchener for 5 days and is now pending. I put in a ticket and guess what. No reply. No help. A previous order came from California, during the pandemic, and was delivered in 3 days. It was shipped by USPS and then FedEx in Canada. Three days from California vs 6+ days from Toronto. CP blames the pandemic. I've got news for them. Their service sucked before the pandemic and now they use it as an excuse. Pathetic."
"If I walked to whatever country or place to get the item I want myself, would be a faster method than using Canada post. The worst possible service ever. Takes 1 week for local delivery from Toronto to 30 minutes east where I live and ordered even express shipping (expedited shipping). If I could, I would sue and give them 0 stars."
"What an awful experience. After 38 days of waiting for an update on my Xpresspost parcel's location, I decided to call customer service about my parcel. It was then that the person on the phone told me the lost my parcel, but failed to let me know about it up to this point??? Now I need to get back in touch with Google about sending me a new phone through a different delivery service like UPS. Terrible experience with Canada post, and I highly suggest everyone chose another service."
"My first package has been in the Mississauga facility for 17 days now. My order consisted of only two items so I don't know why it is taking this long to be shipped. My second package said that it was supposed to be delivered on June 25th by the end of the day, today (June 26th) it says that the date is now pending."
"Had a time sensitive legal document sent EXPRESSPOST from Vancouver June 8. 2-3 days !! MY ASS!!! Following tracking like a drug addiction.... Processed on June 9 in Richmond BC then processed in Mississauga June 11. Sat in transit for 10 days. In the mean time sender shipped document again UPS delivered in less than 24 hours!! Meanwhile Canada post still in transit with delivery pending.......package was FINALLY delivered on June 23.
I understand that because of the current situation that there are delays with deliveries, however, don‚Äôt charge customers express prices when you can‚Äôt have it delivered in the time frame we are paying for!!"
"package ""in transit"" , and not a single update for 6 days"
The person who delivers parcels to my apartment building cannot put the mail in the correct mailbox. Today I was expecting a package from Amazon. I went to my mailbox and had a key in the community parcel locker. In the locker was a package for another apartment. I have no idea what happened to my package. There‚Äôs no way to file a complaint with Canada Post about this.
"I wish I could give them 0 stars. Canada Post is the absolute worst when it comes to packages. I paid $15 for Xpresspost shipping. The tracking updated to say it was ""Expected today"" every day but never arrived. A week later it tells me they left a notice but there is no notice. I tried contacting them and they said a notice was left even though I told them there is no notice so I lost my package, the money I paid for it and the $15 shipping. They tend to do fine if you use a free shipping method but if you're tempted to give them money, don't bother. You're paying them to get your package later than usual if at all."
"Canada Post should go away forever. Please someone with money and pull start up another company so Canadians can finally have a decent, respectful, timely delivery system. Too many disappointments not just for me but according to the reviews pretty much every Canadian who uses them."
"I was waiting patiently for a pair of replacement earrings from a company I had my ears pierced. I was supposed to get this on June 11 but I still haven't received it. It was really needed for my ear because the old earring changed its cubic colour and caused my ear to swell that's why the company sent the replacement. (which also means that it was really urgent for me) The thing that doesn't make sense is that I've received all parcels by Canada Post that I made orders even later than the earring replacement, even the international packages. I created a service ticket, waited and I called. The first time I called and talked to an agent, she said it was received at the local hub and she would leave a note for it so that they can get back to me but haven't received any follow ups, and the second time I called, the agent said that it's been sitting in a trailer at the hub without being able to scan them because they have limited numbers of staff and working hours. I totally understand because this is a difficult time for everyone and it is the busiest time for Canada Post, but at the same time it doesn't make any sense since I've got all other parcels by Canada Post and it's been happening to everyone that has written their complaints"
"Canada post is the most inept and poorly run business. I had a package sent express over night from Niagara,Ont to Kingsron Ont. 350km...paid the Express fees and was told overnight service no problem...4 days later I check and it in transit...tried calling 34 min wait and get cut off...tires on line via chat line and it's a loop, asking would I like to chat with a love agent..hit yes and it just goes back to the beginning. We sink millions of tax dollars into this ""business"" and it cannot deliver an envelope 350km in 4 days!! But I paid a premium...this goves the true meaning of snail mail...a bunch of highly overpaid union protected useless people...never ever will I use this useless service again...Fed Ex, UPS, DHL run like a true business and would close their doora and of they had such horrible useless service"
"sent an expost envelope to other country, but no update since June 1, every day I check, it says""international item being forward to destination county. Mississauga ""
I wonder if it's because Canada Post hasn't process it yet or it gets lost.
anyone has the same issue?"
"Not sure what Canada Post is doing, but fortunately they have COVID-19 to blame their errors on since even their online system is down as of June 25, 2020, but I guess that is due to COVID-19 too. They should be accountable for their actions instead of blaming anything else. This performance should be reviewed and any government funding should be re-evaluated. I advise everyone not to spend any money on Canada post services as it will be wasted money and express service which I paid for has turned into extended delayed service uncommon to any other service."
I think Canada post is in chaos. I have been waiting for a parcel since April 27th when the seller sent me a notice that it was shipped. Canada post says they got it May 1st on their tracking. Then the parcel disappeared. Tracking since May 12th says delivery 1-11 days. It is now June 25. I think there is wholesale thievery going on at Canada post and they are doing nothing about it!
"I know it's tough to move packages during COVID, but other companies are doing a MUCH better job. I had an Express package shipped via Canada Post and it's been delays after delays. Now they are not even able to post an expected delivery date. Just pathetic.

FedEx was able to bring a package from the same city to my house in a DAY this month."
"Canada post was shipping a package from amazon to me in NS. They took 2 months to apparently reach me. They claimed to attempt delivery (i live in an apartment building so they have to buzz my unit). No buzz. No notice. They updated the tracking to say delivered. I saw it 2 hours later when a second package was delivered properly. The first one was not there. They claimed there was no apartment number listed (it's on all Amazon packages to me). They lie and commit fraud.
They also didn't deliver a return package to amazon.
I was told I had to rebuy the order they didn't deliver and tell amazon to bill them for reimbursement. I still lose out on my first order but amazon isn't that stupid to do that. I'm inappropriate for saying I want to sue them. I want to chat with the ceo."
My parcel arrived in town on June 12th.. out for delivery on June 15th.. then listed as rerouted with possible delay on the 15th.. after that nothing but crickets ...no updates .. terrible service.. lack of communication.. can‚Äôt even talk to anyone about it..brutal.. I won‚Äôt use Canada post again for anything other than letter service.. wish I could give them 0 stars
"Absolutely terrible, my package was delayed several times and then on the day the tracking said it was supposed to come it never did! It‚Äôs very frustrating and it‚Äôs causing me to become very upset as I need this for work"
"waiting for 30 days, no package. they have not updated their page since june 4th. at least, they deliver the junk mail and flyers on time. no amount of derogatory name calling would describe these people adequately."
"Received an email stating that, that my parcel was attempted to be delivered at 10:30 am and that notice is left. I check nothing. I am all day home than 3pm my other parcel arrives and no note from previous parcel. And on trucking website it says its delayed. On my email it says delivered 24th June ( and we were 23rd) There is something wrong with their delivery people and service as whole, the worst company to deal with, and yet everthing is made so you can't leave them review. There is no excuse for such horrific service, if other companies do it fine why can't you?"
Canada post is horrible. Package was picked up on June 3 and wasn‚Äôt processed and shipped out until June 24. They had it is sitting in Mississauga for 3 weeks. Package finally moved after I called in and inquired as to what they were doing. Horrible service and they are using covid as an excuse for not doing their job. Funny how another package (From sane sender) was received in Mississauga on June 4 and arrived June 11... shows how they pick and choose what they will ship out quickly and which one will sit for weeks without being touched.
"What is really going on with Canada Post. Received an email stating that my parcel has been delivered to my mail box (personal key) went to check, nothing was there. And so so many delays with my other parcels. Am done with Canada Post. You guys need to check your delivery people because something isn't right."
"Canada post existence in Canada pointless. What a useless corporation that is being pampered by crown corporation.
I never receive deliveries on time. In fact I will be lucky to get my deliveries within a month that is shipped within Canada.

They would use every excuses to delay or not track deliveries. Even wind in different direction an excuse.
Nerve to strike and ask for more money while doing nothing.
Abolish this useless corporation!"
They lost a package and dont want to admit it
"Costing hundreds of dollars in losses to small business through inexplicable delays, unlike any other previous Christmas time volume or peak-Covid emergency. Shipping within Canada being inspected? No problem! You can still accomplish all the above and more, by hiring, instead of rejecting. Or start making reimbursements! Enjoy!"
They don‚Äôt even attempt to deliver packages to my unit. They just leave a note asking me to pick up the package. I pay for shipping to avoid going to stores during covid and have to go to the post pick up store every time the seller ships with Canada post
"We understand the challanges that comes with the current times(COVID), but the lack of information and refusal to ticket and find lost packages for 21 days after they haven't been delivered is beyond horrible. Way to drop the ball and continue to be the worst level of shipping service in the country."
If they shipped your package any other way other then Canada post you would have your package by now. Slow af.
"While Lettermail is decent through Canada Post, the Parcel delivery system is awful. Either let Purolator handle parcels (they're owned by Canada post, but are good with parcels) or privatize the organization."
"The offices and customer service are useless. The mail service is unreliable. A package was shipped out to me February 3, 2020 and it arrived back on the doorstep of the sender on June 23, 2020. 4.5 months MIA? They will not give us a shipping refund. It is time to privatize them so that they are held to the same standards as all other mail delivery systems."
"If post Canada is still in business it's because of tax payers generosity handouts. This company's employees are lazy, fat, rude..........I even suspect corrupt, (Probably Give and receive corruption from the pick up stores owners) that's why they hate delivering parcels to the client's residences instead make them pick up the packages at a filthy, crowded inconvenient stores)"
"I wish I could give them a 0 I would definitely do it.
Absolute nonsense delivery service that does not call the customer, does not try to contact a customer. They prefer to give parcels a ride and take them back to the office so we ALL go and pick them up instead off letting know a customer the parcel is about to arrive and etc. trash company, will always avoid whenever possible."
"How is it that a corporation owned by the Canadian government, on which 38 million people rely on, can be such thieves and get away with this?

June 2020 - My Amazon return package from Toronto (my residence) to Mississauga (Azmazon Facility) which is approximately 30KM is taking 3 weeks to deliver!

June 2020 - A package that I sent to a customer in Montreal from Toronto, is being returned for ""incomplete address"" when everything was double checked with the Canada Post clerk before the package was sent. They do have a database of ALL addresses in Canada.

February 2020 - A complaint ticket that I had opened for ""lost package"" was closed without my knowledge and no resolution was provided, due to ""we didn't have a contact information for you"". Fun Fact: Canada Post CANNOT open a ticket without a tracking number AND complete contact information of the plaintive.

Moral of the story; ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx! Pay a little more to people more honest who will deliver!"
"Shipped from St.Louis to Chicago, 6 hours from Mississauga. Ended up 13 hours too Montreal. 3 weeks in transit.
What a joke, even posted delivery day & still never made it.
Last I looked back in Mississauga.
LH100735075US"
"Complete trash company. I was talking to the agent and wow was he helpful. I tried to explain my situation and goes on to say it was your fault. You guys say different things on the phone and send false emailing. In the end of the day I was the one which got screwed. Thank you so much, your company is so professional. If I could give zeros stars I would."
Awful inflated prices for sending domestic mail. Canada post lost 3 packages of mine in the last month. I pay for tracking yet on all 3 of these packages the tracking shows ‚Äúaccepted ‚Äú and has not updated for two months! Essentially lost in limbo - not only am I not getting a service that I paid for ( tracking) but the process to get my insurance money for the contents is a joke! They closed the service ticket because of not being able to contact the receiver! What difference does it make if the receiver is contacted?! I have PROOF by the tracking number that the package has not been delivered. How hard is it to deliver a package I PAID Inflated cost to have delivered?! I have spent thousands as a small business in shipping to be treated so poorly - no accountability whatsoever! Canada post is stealing money from thousands with their shady business practice and god awful service!!!
I would give less stars if I could. I have like 10 packages from overseas that arrived in Canada over a month ago and I still haven't received them!! Took less time to get to Canada than to get to me in Canada!?! For some reason they have just been sitting on a ton of parcels and not actually delivering them... It is so frustrating. I have no idea what to do. Legit packages arrived on Canada May 15 and their status hasn't moved.
Canada Post has the worst track record of all delivery service options....it's time to pull the plug on this gov't agency which can't deliver! Tracking numbers are useless...date pending? Pending what?
"Ridiculous service huge delays, taking your money without offering the service you‚Äôve paid for. Customer service agent not helpful. Avoid if possible"
"I have Amazon prime and for some unknown reason they continue to use Canada post for delivery. Bad, bad decision. I am still waiting for packages mailed by suppliers in early May . Canada post even listed a reference number as a tracking number. I blame Amazon more than Canada post as the latter's bad service is well known. I definitely will not buy from Amazon. Ca again and wil cancell my prime membership when it is due for renewal. So Canada post get your house in order. This waiting is ridiculous."
"Canada post customer service is garbage. Bought a video game At the beginning of june from Amazon and it said it arrived in my mail box. Checked my mailbox over two days and it was not there. Called Canada Post and said they would Launch an investigation. launch an investigation.Got a call Back from them A few days later saying My package was in the larger compartments on the bottom and I will be getting a key to unlock it. next day, no key. Called again and he said he would ‚Äúlook more into it‚Äù. Its been 2 weeks and I still can‚Äôt get My package from the mailbox because there‚Äôs no key. Im so pissed off I want to bust open the f-ing box to get my package."
"I ordered a 900 dollar laptop from a retailer that is only one town over so I assumed it should ship reasonably even during a pandemic.

That was May 13th It's now June 22nd and the only update have received is that the sender has sent Canada Post the electronic label.

40 days later and there still NO action from Canada Post, is this godamn Mt. Sinai?! It's unacceptable for anyone package to be delayed but I would at least expect there to be a priority on high ticker items like a $900. But clearly they don't have the foresight.

It's like we are being punished for trusting Canada Post! FedEx and UPS are still pulling off 2-Day shipping there's no excuse.

Never ship with Canada Post we have to disenfranchise them of the right to charge for any service, there's no regard for people's belongings.

I'm now attempting to escalate the issue and get a full refund, I don't care where they put the package anymore, I want my time and money back."
"I live in gatineau quebec, i had a package being shipped from hull (25 mins away) and had a 2 day delivery expectation. They somehow managed to send my package to MONTREAL, 4 days later and its been a week since that. Still no package, canada post simply needs to be defended. They can't do the simplest of tasks and this was BEFORE coronavirus."
"I‚Äôve had multiple packages lost, stole or tampered with at the Canada Post sorting centres and other people‚Äôs confidential mail being delivered to me. Canada Post is a complete joke and it‚Äôs a real shame that the government backs such terrible service. Easily the worst customer service experience company in the country. Unreliable and untrustworthy and for that reason I closed my business account with them and ship exclusively with UPS."
"6 weeks ago our mailbox was damaged when an employee jammed a large parcel into our mailbox, damaging it. We called to complain and they said they would fill out an issue form and speak to the employee. Apparently the report was filled out wrong and was ""resolved"". We called multiple (4) times, as we never heard anything. A supervisor called today to say that their employees have been repositioning our mailbox back into place and that people might be going though our mailbox. At no point was our main issue resolved regarding our damaged mailbox. Had they addressed our concerns (original damage to mailbox) or offered to repair/reimburse us for our mailbox, our review would be higher considering we usually have good service with Canada Post."
Ordered an item online with express shipping. It was supposed to arrive 2 weeks ago. Still nothing. I don't recommand using them.
Been waiting for my parcel and they say its in winnipeg already.. yet they delay it and say wait for another month like its already in winnipeg why is it being delayed another month... why don't they just deliver it already. what a joke
"Covid19 related slow down at Canada Post? I think NOT!

Canada Post web site, December 29 2019.
Arbitrator in CUPW negotiations granted six-month extension
The Minister of Labour has agreed to extend the arbitration process by six months, to June 30, 2020, at the request of the arbitrator.

Canada Post web site, June 11 2020.
At this point, we can share with you that the decision includes wage increases for employees represented by both bargaining units of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW-Urban and CUPW-RSMC) of 2.0% effective Feb. 1, 2018; 2.0% effective Feb. 1, 2019; 2.5% effective Feb. 1, 2020, and 2.9% effective Feb. 1, 2021.

In typical fashion for Canada Post Union workers, they pick whatever ""issue"" is in the world to slow our mail during negotiations. Some of this recent slow down may be Covid related, but this slow down more than likely has to due with the negotiations being put on hold for six months. I'll bet your tax dollars, you will now see ""better"" delivery service because they got their raises. I put better in quotes, because as we all know. Canada post at their best still manages to due a less than adequate job.

I now contact online retailers for their parcel delivery companies. If no other option than Canada Post is offered, I look for another retailer. I REFUSE to have any more of my hard earned cash go back into the pockets of such an unorganized near useless Federal money pit.

Canada Post workers from the top down. If you have a problem with all of the negative reviews due to your inability to ""deliver"" and do your jobs in timely manner. Then quit! Or pull up your socks and do your jobs better than you do now. Or hold your lazy coworkers accountable for their lack of work ethic."
"Well its been one month now parcel sitting in Winnipeg it was mailed from Sask called ,made service ticket talked to supervisor was told today they cant do anything until July 7 cause we have to wait 21 days after expected delivery it will be two months by then.Same excuse covid bs mailed a parcel on Sunday by Fed x to go to Nfld got there 4 days later yet a month ago mailed a parcel is sitting in Winnipeg someone needs to take responsibility they should""t be allowed to get away with this.üò°"
They apparently use mules old ones at that...
Stuck in canada post pending delivery for over 2 months now...
"I can't believe the scandalous prices to send a business envelope. One ordinary business envelope you would put a resume in and being mailed from Moncton NB to Miscou Island NB, about 300 KM away was quoted as $15.97. And that is a regular post, nothing special. 5 to 10 business days....Can you imagine almost 16 bucks and the last time I sent a birthday card to that area, I was told 3 to 5 business days and it took 8 days to reach the address...

And one would think with such outlandish prices we would have faster service, but that is not so. And we are not even in the holiday season where mail is expected to move slowly...What a rip off, but of course it is Government isn't it?"
"I certainly understand that delays are part of the current situation. However, Canada Post states on their website, ""Rest assured that your item is always making progress towards its final destination.""

This is a false claim!

I finally got an update on my shipment, which informed me that it took 8 days to ship an envelope from Canada Post in London,Ont to Canada Post in Mississauga, Ont. That is to say - 8 days to ship an envelope 171 km's. Now the envelope has to travel through three more provinces. I sure hope it doesn't get caught up in the Christmas rush.

I am not sure why I paid more to have my envelope delivered as I doubt there is any difference between any of the delivery times Canada Post offers. Even at the best of times Canada Post has a poor performance record. Recently, other service providers have manged to deliver parcels weighing several pounds in 3 days and at reasonable rates.

As a Canadian, I am embarrassed that our national mail system is run so poorly!"
"Worst experience ever, I can‚Äôt believe after all these years of delivering mail, they can be so bad at it."
"I ordered some stuff online
Paid extra shipping so that it can be here before Father‚Äôs Day
It‚Äôs delivered and sitting there in mail box parcel compartment just because the mail man did not check that the tag he left in my mail box has no key attached to it.
Been calling Canada post from last 2 days
Talked with supervisor
No one called back
Left a hand written note for mail man
But no use
Really really bad service
So disappointed
Now I will get the package on Monday
One day after Father‚Äôs Day
Just because of their fault"
"Can't deliver packages, currently waiting on a letter that was mailed to me 2 months ago from same city. Joke of an operation"
Canada post Mississauga...where packages go to die! Is it the next Bermuda triangle? Every package gets stuck there for weeks on end! A package made it through 2 Canada post locations in Alberta and then traveled to Ontario in 2 days. For 5 days now its sitting in Missisauga. Come on guys!
"Xpresspost apparently means nothing. It's been a week and the package is still sitting at the canada post location where I dropped it off. I could deliver a package faster if I walked, at this rate."
I ordered a package and it never showed up I spent 100 dollars on it and it says it was delivered when it never was so if I don‚Äôt get my package is the next 2 hours I swear to god Canada post is the worst delivery service in the world and if it doesn‚Äôt show up I‚Äôm blaming the Mail‚Äôs person for stealing it and then suing the company so if I don‚Äôt get it I swear to god
"If I could give minus (-) 5 stars I would give it to Canada Post Service. Previous item was late by 4 weeks while FedEx and UPS kept everything on time. I did not realize that one of my recent purchases was going to be shipped through Canada Post after leaving the US. Sure it did and today is the last day that the package should have been delivered by. Called Canada Post and they told me that it may take another 10 days. WT*!
All the time the same answer - ""we are overloaded with mail"", well - how is it my problem? Stop offering your services then and close your business. Stop pretending that you are managing the situation!
I am just as overloaded like everyone else and yet I deliver stuff on time and work overtime to get stuff done.
I am avoiding any business that deals with Canada Post because I know that I will not get it on time.
Bunch of useless workers who cannot deliver..."
"I stopped by the Comox BC Post Office located next to the 19 Wing Comox RCAF base today. I left feeling like Canada Post is a third rate government run waste of resources. I don't often use this post office as it is a little out of the way, but there is never a long wait. Today, a single older lady employee was there to help. I asked to mail a cylindrical parcel \to Manitoba, she was not very helpful, and insisted that I write the address on the cylinder. I did, but asked if there was not a label that I write the address on, she just said no. Then she weighed measured and charged me an surcharge because it was a cylinder. I asked why, she just said ""because! I don't know"". I left it at that. Well she measured it lengthwise and width wise. The diameter she multiplied by 2. So I guess that takes care of a box that measures the same width and height as the diameter, but the cylinder surcharge? This was not on the Canada Post website as I per-calculated the charges before going. So, not happy with either the employee's attitude, and service, nor with Canada Post's lack of cylinder calculation on their website."
"Product late. Says it will be here today. Then, I ask where it is on their ""Virtual assistant"" and they say most likely the next business day (monday). Pretty annoyed to say the least .. why say the expected delivery date is today when they knew it wouldn't be here today? Quite P***ed off at the moment. Will try to avoid shipping from Canada Post again. Don't recommend"
I ordered a medication from USA in March. It took so long and it say it is delivered on June 10. I nvr got it it cost me 500 dollars. I phoned Canada post office customer service talked to supervisor but she said they can not find my parcel I m very upset I ordered this medicine they say contact the sender to file a claim. It is very poor service Canada post should do something. We pay so much tax this is what we get. They can track the parcel which driver had it and whom they delivered but the do not want to do that. They should fire the person whose truck had my parcel.
"i buy a computer. monitor and keyboard and i'm ok with when it will arrive. the computer comes first then the keyboard then the monitor, ok. the day when the computer is suppose to arrive. nothing comes. then 15 days later the keyboard and monitor arrive, what the hell happened that made my two packages that were suppose to arrive later come now?!? and then 5 days later i get my computer? like jeez, great stuff"
After more than a month of waiting. my parcel finally left Mississauga.... now its in Toronto while I live in Montreal
"I‚Äôve repeatedly waited for parcels a week to two weeks that have shipped across to country to be stuck in transit 20 km away from me for one week... two weeks???
What is going on with our postal service And why do other delivery services still work well but not Canada Post?"
"I am starting to think that there is a zombie apocalypse in Mississauga.
I have 5 packages stuck there for weeks, very expensive packages too. This is the absolute worst shipping company in the whole Canada."
A disgrace - priority and xpresspost stuck for weeks in Mississauga. No excuse for that. A few days ok but weeks - no. This needs to be fixed asap!!!
"The 5 stars are for the Canada Post people I have dealt with over the phone. Always courteous and professional.

I give zero stars to their delivery system. They lost and eventually found my passport earlier this year, ruining a planned business trip. Now, they have lost the medication I get delivered from Costco. A replacement package was to be delivered yesterday but like magic, the tracking delivery status changed from ‚Äútoday‚Äù to ‚Äúpending‚Äù.

On top of that, I ordered something from Amazon this week and they normally deliver by courier but, you guessed it, it was sent by Canada Post have they have now tagged it as being delayed.

I want to believe in and support Canada Post but have been really scarred this year. I hope they can turn things around."
"21 days out for delivery? Are you Fecking kidding me, I
Could of hired a malnourished puppy and it would of gotten here faster."
"Generally impressed with the service of Canada Post, but there tracking of parcels could be more up to date ‚Äúwhere ‚Äú the parcel is now."
"Imagine if Amazon said that they won't deliver your parcel for the 'foreseeable future' because too many people were ordering patio furniture? All the while, allowing customers to pay a premium for expedited service that they knowingly cannot provide. This is the definition of fraud. Canada Post is a third-world tier, beauracratic mess of a failed company. Because this Clown Corporation operates with total impunity, they get away with the most asinine excuses. Its about time Canadians stop giving them a break and buying their excuses. Like any other company that sleeps on its morals and abuses its customers, it should be left to fail (and in miserable fashion). I received my last expedited parcel that I will ever allow them to handle - after an unprecedented 63 days in transit and four (yes, four) processing errors. This is in addition to taking 12 hours on the final delivery date to ship a distance that amounts to a 10-minute walk to my door. Zero stars."
"They've not only managed to lose my package once, but somehow twice. Amazon was well enough to send a replacement but Canada post went and lost that one, too.
I get it. It's a pandemic. Things are late and that's fine. Except it's not just late. It's gone. Twice. It's been over a month now.
Canada post has never been known for dependable service and I've avoided them as much as humanly possible because of it, so I knew this wasn't going to be easy. I wish I hadn't been so right.
If you ever have a choice to use any other service, even if it's carrier pigeon. Use it. It'll not only get there faster, but actually get there."
"Not going to make this long winded, but why is it that UPS, Purolator, Amazon, etc. can do their deliveries on time, but Canada Post finds it impossible to deliver as promised? COVID was a blessing for Canada Post wasn't it? Phew! Now they have an excuse for not getting off their collective asses and doing their job."
"Bring back the pony express, this is the worst service ever. I have parcels everywhere and apparently no where. So far I am averaging 3-4 weeks for a parcel to travel across two provinces. Ridiculous. No doubt this is just a place to vent, how nice would it be if someone actually read and reacted to such deplorable service"
"I have about half a dozen packages that have landed in the black hole known as Mississauga. Packages go in but rarely or never come back out.

Canada Post, they say is severely backlogged. Triple the usual amount. It just goes to show how completely unable they are to cope with even the slightest inconvenience.

So now, Canada Post has apparently sought help from crappy, never-heard-of companies like Apple Express Couriers to help with the backlog. Well, Apple Express has had some of my packages ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù for over a week! The packages were picked up, so they say, right here in my hometown. They are still out for delivery over a week later!

Thanks, Canada Post, for screwing things up even more than you already have!"
"Several orders without any idea when/ETA even given after all are tracked.

It's a friggeennnnn disaster my pack is stuck in Winnipeg and 2 others in smaller places.

I live in montreal youd expect faster delivery being one if the main hubs......


Worst service ever... they pay by day and delivery guys are working up to 3 -5 hours more a day and are unionized.... what you think will happen....

Start paying these employees better for the harder work for a month . Just 1 month and it would fix things I bet..."
They have about 20 packages that they were supposed to deliver over a month ago and now there's no tracking information nothing. Why did they receive it if they are not going to deliver? The virus is just their excuse as I've had packages delivered from other companies and they arrived on time.
"Worst courier ever. My item is still stuck in Montreal, QC from Missisauga, ON for over a week now and before it was stucked for 2 weeks on Ontario. Even though the whole world is in pandemic it never took this long. They're very incompetent!"
"Sucks , it was supposed to be delivered yesterday ,it hasn‚Äôt arrived yet and there is no information available on their website ,who takes a week time to delivered from Milton to Toronto"
"The package is nearly a month late and by the looks of it (based off of the tracking site), it took a whole tour of Canada. I was home all day and no delivery attempt was made despite the update to the status online. Furthermore, I don't even have the tracking slip they supposedly left for me!
I get times are tough with Covid - But look at all of the reviews on this page. Seems like this isn't a one off. What a mess.

Update - Package was delivered to a Canada Post office location that is closed down. I can't access the package."
"I ordered a package that was sent with Canada Post. ""Item was released by Customs and was with Canada Post for processing in Mississauga, ON"" on May 20th - Delivery Standard of May 22nd.
After May 22nd I contacted Customer Support to get answers as to how long it would take or some sort of information to show some progress. I kept getting the same cope-pasted speeches about ""Delays from Covid"" and ""Christmas levels of delays"". I even created a service ticket but I didn't help at all, or at least not that I can tell. It took until June 16th before the item was finally processed in Montreal.
June 18th I get an update telling me ""Item re-routed due to processing error"". I find out they sent it to the wrong Montreal facility, not the one in my area, and am now expected to have more delays. No answers - no expedition - or any help to get the package where it needs to go.

TLDR: It's been a month and the package still hasn't arrived, and on top of that it was sent to the wrong sorting facility. Customer service was no help, basically saying ""sorry we have no information and there's nothing we can do""."
"No updates for tracking etc ... what's the point of their services . So yes they are seeing the same volume as xmas well then get it done it's your job ... we've had to do ours as well during covid 19 and we dont get to give excuses to customers who have paid!!!
I've waited two months for a package already the sender paid extra fees to get it to me quicker due to delays and canada post has had it for over two weeks no update"
The postmaster in chetwynd bc is absolutely substandard to say the least.a simple id& address verification that took 2 and a half minutes to transact in dawson creek bc post officr.took 6 visits to the chet po and was still denied as not adequate identification...presented bc drivers licence.on the 6th visit he said he wanted my landlord agreement as the only document that would allow him to verify my address in chetwynd.as i said 2& 1/2 minutes in dc was all it took to complete the transaction.
"What's the point in paying for Amazon Prime if everything I order for same/next day delivery arrives late. ""Got to etobicoke at 11:36 a.m - 8 hours 40 mins later still sitting there and now an update, ""products can still arrive by June 18-19th but if you haven't received by Saturday the 20th check back"" so now I have to wait to receive the items just so I can't print a label to return them because they are past the dates I needed them for"" ridiculous service"
"I've been waiting for a few packages that were shipping out of Toronto (to Montreal): one is going on a month with no update (Mississauga), two are sitting at 2 weeks with no update (Mississauga) and one has been sitting at the ""originating"" post office for over a week - it hasn't even left for bloody Mississauga. And when it finally gets to Mississauga, it's going to sit there for who knows how long, because MISSissauga is a big black hole. Also, some of my packages have beeb ""expedited"", which is funny since selling that service is essentially a way to make money. The delivery timeline isn't even being respected. You can't speak to a live person and when you do reach someone, they have no way of responding to your questions or telling you where your crap is. As far as their web site goes - it's completely useless because it doesn't actually tell you anything. Statuses don't get updated for weeks and when you click on 'more details' (or whatever it's called), you don't actually get any damn details! Everything is missing in MISSissauga!"
One of my orders was local the place was about an hour away and it took almost 10 Business days to get here. My other package is a bit farther but it hasn‚Äôt been updated in 6 days. I have no idea where my package is or if it is lost. Very disappointed by this. Also costumer service is always too busy so you can only talk to the automatic service. Horrible horrible horrible. PERIODT.
"I have had several orders that are less than 2 hours away take a month...
Now they aren't even updating the tracking..
Time to defund.
I will not order from anyone who uses CP"
"One package from April still in transit, another from may just lost, and one from June 8 is probably lost waiting for confirmation. This is beyond a reasonable delay, it's a complete breakdown."
"The most impressive display of ineptitude on a mass scale . Why would you as a business offer a service that you can't possibly deliver on? No pun intended. 21 business days before I can open a service ticket ? That's truly pathetic like the fact that there's no refunds period until you surpass 21 days and at that you'll get your oh so generous 100$ insurance return if they lose your stuff even if it's a pair of I dunno 900$ shoes that resell for 3000$ 100$ here ya go were square. Disgusting. If you can't do it don't offer it. Xpresspost should be gone if you can't get close to the delivery times then make it a flat rate for flat rate bottom of the barrel service. Your truly the pond scum of the package delivery business maybe step into the 2020's and upgrade your stuff and make your employees I dunno... Scan parcels ? Seems hard I know, replace them with far better faster and more efficient robots. Robots can't strike and wouldn't fall behind. Hire drivers let robots and automated platforms take care of the overflow the humans you have can't handle. You suck so badly Amazon made a better delivery service in a month. You guys have had my parcels collectively for like 45 days between 4 parcels. That's not acceptable at all. One of them is xpresspost. You are not capable stop taking packages from Amazon you know for a fact you cannot deliver before any of your competitors. Just roll over and quit let some new humans maybe then it will move faster. Half the workforce twice the packages? Ever heard of problem solving? Solve the problem and it goes away imagine that!? Build another facility if you need to then when covid dies down you'll actually be able to keep up with normal volumes. Even not giving a dollar back until 21 business days you still post massive losses forgive me for thinking this but aren't business's supposed to make money ? Not burn it like it's the only thing left on earth to provide heat during an ice age. Like come on guys get better or quit. 55 mill lost q1 2020 without refunding a dollar. Well done üëçüëç"
"I cringe each time I make an online purchase only to discover Canada Post is the delivery agent.

I just laugh when I track an item and it shows ""out for delivery."" It usually arrives 3 days after. That of course is when I'm lucky enough to get ANY CURRENT tracking information. Another parcel was sent from retailer June 11th. It's now June 17th and CP's tracking system hasn't had any updates in 6 days. I'm not sure why Cda Post is considered an essential service when they can't provide a reasonable service....ever. Covid might be a crutch for past 3 months but CP was horrible even before covid."
"iving on a farm in Kelowna, I do a lot of ordering from amazon.ca When you order from amazon, your payment is either included or paid for by the customer. i have great delivery service from the couriers but when it comes to canada post; hahahahahahaha you have better luck thinking Jesus and prayers are going to save us all from coronavirus and Donald Trump.

I have to take time out of food production to go into town to retrieve a package, the drive was too lazy to deliver. I received a notice today via email saying an attempt at delivery was tried but no one was there to accept it. I do all accepting of packages to this address. Aco-worker and I have been here working in the barn, where deliveries are instructed by Amazon sent to their carriers, yet no one attempted a delivery. As well no ticket telling me where to pick up the package was left in the mailbox."
Duped by Canada Post again! Paid more than twice as much for ‚ÄúExpress Shipping‚Äù and once again the package is late. Taking just as much time as standard shipping. Covid19 is not an excuse. Every other courier on the planet seems to be doing fine. At this point our time and money will be much better spent on training pigeons to deliver the mail. Never again....again.
"Terrible Postal Service, rather pay extra using other couriers. At least i do not have to wait a month (still am) for my package."
"Probably the worst postal company in the world!!!
Someone sent me a package from Montreal to Toronto 3 weeks ago. For 2 weeks the tracking number have been showing that the package was at the Montreal facility. Finally after two weeks the package shows on its way and finally out for delivery from Mississauga.
Now for the 4th days it shows delivery date pending after being told 2 times that the package would be delivered before end of the day.
I guess my package is now travelling and visiting the Toronto GTA unless it was just lost or stollen which would not be a surprise.
When we call customer service all we hear now is ¬´ this is due to COVID ¬ª. Please, we know COVID has a significant impact on businesses and I truly understand that, but take your part of the responsibilities. It‚Äôs not COVID related if a damn package sit in a truck for 4 days!
This is ridiculous!!!"
Over a month my packages just sit in Quebec. According to their tracking they received the packages on May 12 in Mirabel Quebec and as of June 16 it still says that they are sitting in Montreal. Talk about useless I could have paid somebody to walk the packages across Canada faster than that. At this rate my packages should arrive sometime in 2021.
COVID is no damn excuse....it's been a month and NOTHING....POS customer service....POS workers....POS company.....hope they go bankrupt!!!
"DO NOT USE CANADA POST!!!!! You will regret it if you do. On Jun 1st I sent two small packages via XPost (2 day delivery) from Ottawa, one weighed .13kg going to Welland, ON and other .286kg going to North Bay. It cost $30.71!!
For two weeks, I was tracking my packages and there was no info except for date items were shipped (I friggin‚Äô knew that info!!) I finally submitted tickets to locate my packages a few days ago and requested a refund. Lo and behold, today Jun 17th, on the tracker I see my items which are finally on the move ... FROM MONTREAL!!! I requested a full refund today again. Received a reply that they have suspended their service delivery guarantees and will not provide any refunds! We do NOT need Canada Post, let‚Äôs get rid of them!! DO NOT USE CANADA POST!!!!!!"
"Fvck Canada post. Worst delivery service on the fvcking planet. I hope they get shut down...I‚Äôd be better off delivering my own packages. At least ups gives you a day when it‚Äôs going to come, and follows through. Canada post can‚Äôt even do that."
Horrible inconsistent company. Giant percentage of the employees don't give a Fk about their job and 100% of them don't give a Fk about your package. They're making a mistake with someones mail as I type this right now. I don't know what else to say...if you work at canada post receiving and forwarding mail please just quit and get into carpentry or what ever you're dreaming about when you're working.
Worst service i have ever seen. My friend delivered a package for me on june 2nd and they committed 6 business days today is june 17 and i have not yet received it.
"Absolutely the worst!
I sent my documents to Australia more than a month ago. It was supposed to be delivered 3-7 working days. I don't know where my package is (they didn't update the status frequently), I sent them an email, they replied after a while and told me that it takes 30 to 60 days to track my package and get back to me!!!!!!!!!!!!
and I missed my deadline to submit my documents because of Canada post and they apparently don't care at all."
"They accept money for express post then REFUSE to honour the agreement, they do nothing but make excuses all the time, they have had my Item for more than a week sitting on a truck and WILL NOT DELIVER IT, this place needs to be shut down and time to privatize the mail is Canada cause these LOSERS can not do the job period."
"The older white woman who works at the Bur Oak and McCowan Markham location is very inhospitable (works like Mon-Wed). She is always unprofessional and does the bare minimum of work to serve the customers. I advise others to avoid going to this location during the days this woman is working there. Canada post should really consider the type of employees they hire, as it reflects their overall company reputation."
"Canada post is completely incompetent when it comes to shipping packages and their customer ""support"" is atrocious. I spoke with a ""manager"", who will remain nameless for the public review, who was completely rude, inconsiderate, condescending, and unhelpful. She failed to see a problem with the fact that they are asking people to wait 21 DAYS for packages to be processed when their website states an anticipated 5 day delay. I have had many packages shipped and received with minimal or no delays using other agencies. I will avoid any retailer that only offers Canada Post in the future and will make sure to pay for ANY other option to avoid the headaches that this shipping agency has caused.

Complete and utter incompetence all around, from processing packages to their support personnel.

EDIT: I found the Board of Directors for Canada Post on their website and, according to Rocket Reach, their email convention goes as follows: firstname.lastname @ canadapost.ca

I emailed all individuals on that page using that same convention and only had one email rejected as undeliverable. While I doubt it will do anything in my case, maybe if more people email their executives directly they will be incentivized to act and do something about their staffs current inability to process packages.

To locate the Canada Post Board of Directors on their website, they can be found by plugging the following into a Google search: ""canada post meet the board of directors"".

The first (non-advertisement) link should take you to the board of directors, after which the email convention can be followed to contact all but one person on the list."
"Its simple they never cared and now with Covid19 they are not even trying nor trying to hide it. Not a single attempt is being made at deliveries, not even trying yet leaving the message ""We were unable to catch you."" I was home and i was waiting, why bother. On 1 item, sure a bad apple...on all? Hum the whole tree is spoiled. This is not one employee this is a rotten core of a bad managed company."
"We are a Small Business in Quebec that ships daily across Canada. We have clients calling us each day because CPC cannot cover their own customer service, they are now telling recipients to contact their vendors, as if we can help. We did our part, we put your order on the truck, why is it our fault that they cant deliver. Their customer service is lying and telling people that the parcels have been lost but from our inside sources at CPC, there are now over 800 fifty-foot trailers across Canada that have not been unloaded yet. They will be backed up until 2021 at this rate. Don't expect to get your parcel anytime soon and please do small businesses a favour and don't call them, blaming them, asking for shipping refunds (CPC is not offering any refunds for delivery delays), asking them to ship out another shipment free of charge, we unfortunately cannot do any of these as we would go bankrupt overnight. It's not the vendors fault, its our own fault for buying everything from Amazon, paying for Mr. Bezos next island to buy, and tying up the Canadian infrastructure. We need to support local, get off Amazon, tell Jeff Bezos to shove it, and defund CPC. Government funding and unions make workers lazy and disinterested in their performance. Truely no one there really cares from what I've seen and heard."
"Two untracked DVD sets purchased June 2nd from an eBay vendor in AB got to me in NS on the 9th. However, the vintage portable tape recorder I purchased from an eBay vendor in Ontario on May 27th still hasn't arrived as of today (June 16th) and the tracking information has been stuck on ""item in transit"" since May 28th."
"Horrendous customer service and pure incompetency. By far the worst courier service in Canada, bar none. Package has been stuck in BC for almost 3 weeks now. These guys are lazy and just don't care. Do yourself a favor and use another service, even if you have to pay a little extra. Holy guacamoley."
"They should honestly just shut down. Embarrassing customer service, terrible all around service, and no one ever knows what's going on."
"If there is a way they can say NO...they will. I ordered something to be delivered to my door, with the leave at door option if I wasn't home. Was tracking package and was due for delivery on Monday June 15th between 9-1PM. Was planning to be home, they tried delivery the day before, not home. Spoke to two supervisors, Barb...couldn't say no enough, then asked to speak to her supervisor, Kelly, who informed me she is Senior Supervisor and has been doing this a long time. Yes, contradicted herself and colleagues and managed to say NO in as many ways as possible. This is crap, worst service ever and we have NO choice!"
"I like many others would give a rating of 0 if possible.
I ordered safety masks from downtown Toronto to be delivered to midtown Toronto on June 5th. I received notification on June 5th the item was picked up an processed for delivery on June 5th at the Toronto facility.
Checking the tracking on June 7th the parcel was out for delivery,
By June 11th still no parcel but according to the tracking it was now processed in Richmond BC.
I called customer service who offered no help at all - nothing they can do for 21 days.
Today June 16th the item is still sitting in Richmond,BC.
I need these masks so I can go outside and am not prepared to order more due to their incompetence.
I understand delays due to the pandemic but hire more people to deal with the delays and incorrect routing!"
"I had a package picked up in a Montreal suburb on June 2nd. It was scanned at the Montreal Post Office on June 3rd at 3:51 am.

Canada Post has not scanned this package again since June 3rd. Today is June 16th and there is no indication of where the package is or even when they expect it to be delivered to my home in Newcastle, Ontario.

It is understandable that there will be some delays in service during the current COVID-19 issue but it would be a reasonable expectation that Canada Post would at least scan the package to be able to confirm exactly where it is."
"Canada post cost me $6,000 in the past 6 months because they didn‚Äôt deliver my packages to customers within Canada, the U.S and worldwide. Their tracking system is ridiculous! Shame on you for damaging Canadian businesses. This is one of the reasons small businesses can‚Äôt grow in Canada. Never will I be dealing with your pathetic service again."
"Worst service EVER!! I'm wanting for a package from outside Canada and I don't know when I will get it! It's been almost 2 months and I don't have an answer. Every time I call the customer service they tell me that they're unable to let me know when I will receive it. POST CANADA if you can't deliver a package then DON""T TAKE IT!! If you don't have the system, the capacity or the people then just tell us and we will go to another service!
Figure your ..hitt out and then get back in business!"
"Ordered a parcel from Minneapolis, the next day the city erupts into violence and riots because of George Floyd. Post offices got burned, mail trucks trashed, they had to take everyone's mail to a secure location outside Minneapolis, pretty sure people got shot and killed. USPS not only kept my tracker updated, they managed to get my parcel out of the country in less than a week. Canada Post couldn't even be bothered to scan my parcel through customs, I got that info from USPS. Been almost two weeks now that my parcel has been in Canada and I've had more information about it from the people whose workplace was actually physically burned to the ground."
"June06
i sent a expresspost from Montreal to Montreal Ôºåuseless call center Ôºåirresponsibility . they said you can do nothing but waiting."
"They are the absolute worst...
A package that should have taken maximum a few days to be delivered to me is now delayed by 6 weeks. They say it is because of COVID but private courriers like purolator and others are still working within normal timeframes... really the worst"
"Extremely slow, I understand extra tasks involved due to Covid but Canada post is extremely slow compared to competitors. If your buying something look on Amazon, they even deliver on weekends! Canada post is very inconsistent with time it takes, and basically tells customers dont call customer service they have no more info than the website. Dont waste money on expedited shipping I've been waiting a month for a package that comes just 4 hrs away yet my bf's package from a different country (US) arrived after 2 weeks of being ordered. Amazon took 3 days with my last order. Just avoid a purchase u cant wait for if the shipper is Canada post."
"What a infuriating sham! How is it tolerated that a company charges for a mail delivery service and then make it literally impossible for customers to contact them to inquire about the status of a parcel if the tracking indicates it‚Äôs been stuck in limbo for almost two months? If it was anything other than a Cdn Crown Corp their business licence would risk getting yanked for such deplorable customer service.

I‚Äôve now filed two Service Tickets on a parcel, the 2nd personally with an agent after being placed on hold for almost an hour only to be be informed the first Service Ticket was cancelled by CP. Obviously the 2nd was as well because I‚Äôve received no followup email communication by June 9th as promised. I strongly suspect somebody sits there hitting the Service Ticket delete key all day so CP thereby obliterates all evidence of how many 1000s of packages they‚Äôve lost track of."
"They‚Äôre taking advantage of the Covid situation to deliver packages more slowly. There is no excuse why my package couldn‚Äôt be delivered last week, it just sat in a delayed status for no reason. Will consciously avoid Canada post for the rest of my life and will convince others to do the same, I would‚Äôve driven the two hours to pick up the item had I know this was going to happen."
"As I am writing this, I still haven't gotten my package. I ordered it on June 5th, and it says it will come on July 3rd. You must be thinking: but its probably far from your house!
Well, it's not. Literally, it's a 20 minute drive to our house to deliver the package. I would give this -200 stars if I could, but that's not a thing anywhere, soooo yeah."
"Very slow service even prior to covid. My small parcel has take 9 days to get from oshawa, ontario to halifax and 14 days to go from Halifax to a small town 20 min north of the city and has no end delivery date in site. Not worth the expensive price to ship, charging extra for tracking when they know full well the parcels wont be delivered. we are using secureship with no headaches. CANADA post website says due to a 2 metre social distancing rule they have limited workers!? They cant where masks ? I guess working at Canada post is more social then work. DEFUND CANADA POST!!"
"terrible, terrible service. The lack of quality is so outstanding that they should win an award. I run a small buisness and the amount of money i've lost due to their incompetence is actually outrageous. It took them an entire month to ship something from Ontario to Quebec. They won't even honour their package insurance. Read their list of non-insurable materials before you ship something because it is massive, they pretty much don't ensure anything so be careful and don't expect good customer service from them. the worst shipping company i've ever used"
"I would give zero stars if it was an option..Canada Posts service took a huge dive several years ago with the pathetic conservative government reducing service and funding so they could stuff the $ in their pockets,more less making Canada Post a pathetic service..Today marks one month for a shipment from Calgary to Vancouver that I am dealing with..And they just shrug their shoulders...
Message to the current government..Finish the job..Kill Canada Post ,to then allow a sensible organization take over and provide service..
Canada Post..Your service is a joke! and because your a government agency your not accountable.."
"Waiting 21 days to get an item from mississauga and i live in milton which is 25 mins on 401 this is horrible
Calling them And wait for 35-45 mins to open a ticket every time they find an excuse To don‚Äôt open a ticket"
I ordered a small package may 17 another one June 3 never heard nothing
Incompetent workers together with terrible management creates awful services for everyone else.
"Items been in transit for weeks now, constantly changing delivery dates, and no customer service whatsoever. All of the shipments were close near the address, yet took days to even process. What a sham of a company. I hope amazon takes over the market. What a god damn waste of everyone's time."
"Absolutely the worse customer service and package handling service I have ever come across. The staff are ignorant since they are paid minimum wage and have a Union. After going back and forward between two offices for two days and 4 customer Service Supervisors on the phone (each 40-60 min hold time), my time sensitive documents sent from Vancouver to Calgary are still missing and no one is able to tell us where the package is. Just to make clear this is registered mail expedited service which has charged us $12 for three pages of documents to go from Vancouver to Calgary.
The last agent we spoke to basically said, ""I can't tell you where your package is, what is the Post office Depo address, or their hours. You will have to get that from my supervisor""; she put me on hold for another 40 minutes and when asked the same from the supervisor I received the exact same answer ""sorry, I can't give the address or hours for the post office depo and I cannot confirm if your package is there"".
This is what happens when an industry is influenced too much by unions! Make sure you do not trust them with any important or time sensitive items"
keep changing the date of expected delivery when they can't meet it very lame and unprofessionnal
I would rather have a 2x4 nailed to my nut sack then use this garbage service again.
Always making mistakes causing more delays ...
"...I'm so sick of their crappy customer service they need to be shut down. When I get mail in my box downstairs (flyers and bills) they are always on point but if I have a package, forget it. They have left it outside my apt. when it needed a signature, it's been thrown at me, it's been left on the bench by the elevators when my apt is clearly on the package. I've had to go pick it up multiple times because my tracking Email says ""address verification needed"" when it was clear and precise on the package. When ever they need to do extra work they treat you horrible. Then I call them and can't get through or they put me off until they are closed and I can't do anything about it. They don't care if it's the weekend or not. I didn't do anything to deserve this at all."
"Canada Post was terrible before the pandemic, now they might as well not even exist."
"Time to review the horrendously outdated ID requirements for picking up a parcel.

I get it, you want to cut down and eliminate mail fraud and ensure that the right person is getting the right package, but here‚Äôs a scenario for you: I create a delivery and payment profile so I can buy something on a website. The company issued a tracking number and they send me an email telling me so. The parcel tracking app on my phone picks this number up as soon as I open the email and it‚Äôs added with all the other tracking numbers for the things I‚Äôve ordered since getting the app. So before it‚Äôs even shipped (which I also know when it occurs by email) I know the tracking number and can pull it up on my phone whenever I want.

So the item ships to my city but is too large to fit in the boxes the Harper government mandated everyone use and a notice is left in my post box for which only I have keyed access to. I go to the closest post office where my package ended up, notice in hand, many forms of ID in hand, with all the proof of purchase and tracking numbers sitting on my phone, to go pick up my package.

Here is where you are failing us.

My ID is not acceptable. None of it. None of it has my address. I have multiple other forms of ID with my name on it, a notice from Canada Post which only I could have accessed, and all the tracking information email and GPS-enabled smartphones afford us well into the 21st century and none of it is acceptable to your employees.

You know why you‚Äôre failing to individual contractors for Amazon, to FedEx, even Purolator and UPS (who in particular during the pandemic, have been excellent). These companies kept pace with technological advancements that the public has also kept pace with. They trust the information we give them through these technologies just as we do. They know that it is very unlikely for a person with the same name and address to meet them at the door, expecting a package that their phone tells them is out for delivery that day, states their name to the deliverer, for that person to not be the one the package is intended for.

The most infuriating thing about one entrenched bureaucracy relying another entrenched bureaucracy to provide acceptable ID (that we have to pay for out of pocket rather than taxes) so that we can pick up things we ordered and paid for is that it‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors. It really just comes down to the discretion of the employee who happens to help us at the counter. They don‚Äôt scan the acceptable ID into the system to ensure everything is above board, they simply look at it. Then these employees quote policy as if it has any meaning at all within today‚Äôs technologically interconnected context on top of having multiple forms of ID with the same name. So what it actually comes down to is ‚ÄòBecause the rules say so.‚Äô

Now I understand why Harper cut as deep as he did. You couldn‚Äôt keep pace with the changes of the 21st century with the funding and the people you had. But instead of changing such outdated policies to improve your service, you remain entrenched and ossify further as you watch, with full awareness, as your competitors bring us the things we want rather than the things we don‚Äôt like ads for lawn care to condos."
"Trash. Out of four orders ordered since May, three of them have been delayed due to 'processing errors', one even had several processing errors on them. Customer service was not helpful in the slightest, the CP delivery person claimed to have attempted delivery, my buzzer didn't ring, not even a missed delivery card was left and I WAS HOME the entire time. Checked my post box an hour later and they'd come back with the missed delivery card. If you're going to come back, why not just give me my damn package! I cannot even begin to say how fed up I am of their service."
I said it before and I'll say it again oh my God Canada Post sucks they need to close their doors and go out of business and find a real Postal Service that's able to deliver your parcels on time and to the right place
When will the Government step in and do something about this service. We are paying their wages and all we do is get pooped on and never receive our parcels. Things were paid with Canada post pre covid and now they have the perfect excuse.
"I have now been waiting an additional 3 days for a domestic package which hardly weighs one pound. The package arrived to the city beside mine, and literally has not moved in 72 hours, Even though I know my parcel is a half hour drive away from me at most. Use anyone but canada post. And the deliver date says ""pending"" for 3 days aswell now"
"Canada Post is trouble maker, It should be shutdown."
"Last Friday June 5th I ordered some lug nuts from Miami Florida, and a cell phone case from Montreal Quebec.

I am near Ottawa Ontario. Lug nuts arrived from the states via Fed Ex this past Wednesday June 10.

The Cell phone case to be delivered by Canada Post, and a mere two hours away from my residence is still ‚Äú in transit‚Äù"
"Extortion! Tried to buy a single stamp for a letter to the UK. The ignoramus behind the Plexiglas told me that I had to purchase a whole book of stamps for overseas and they would not sell me a single stamp. I don't care for your canned excuses. You simple have no concept of customer service. And, apparently, you have done a wonderful job at hiring/contracting people who reflect your lack of customer service aptitude."
Canada Post is so unreliable. Packages never get here on time. :(
"One bad experience I can overlook...but not five in a row. Not even worth 1 star

No updates, unhelpful customer service and tracking is good for nothing. I had my passport sit 5 weeks without an update despite several calls, left voicemails as they never got back to me and then when it eventually did get to where I was they delayed it again claiming I wasn't even in when I was. Its the pandemic - I am hardly gonna be in Barbados am I?

Now 2 parcels sitting in Mississauga without an update for 2 weeks. If there was a way to avoid using this service, I really would."
"Canada post is absolutely terrible!!
I ordered something online, it was tracked to Canada sorting center in ""Guelph Ontario "" on April 23/2020, i still haven't received it yet, and its already
June 11/2020. I tried calling many times with no luck, as the tracking number it had was not familiar to Canada post, so they cant do anything at all. When an overseas parcel enters canada, does it not get scanned and converted to a canada post tracking number? Im not sure about this, but it would be pretty slick if they had a simple system like that. Guess we have to pay extra and go with FedEx from now on, might be allot better. You also cant file a complaint without a ticket number, but the tracking number im given from the sellers country is not acceptable on canada post website, so you cant get a service ticket to file a complaint. So basically, if you use Canada Post for anything like that, your SCREWED!!"
"I bought food supplies from Windsor Ontario the first of June and shipped the parcel the same day, I am in Alberta and we are the 11 of June and NOTHING, if Canada post want to do a good job they should hire more people, there is lot‚Äôs of people that really need jobs right now due to Covid 19. Again we need to turn to other delivery services, Stay away if you can from Canada post."
"12 days without information updating, now the tracking page just showing delivery date pending, I have no idea when will my package arrive."
"If I could, Id give zero stars. I have four small boxes of books Ive ordered from an outlet in Ontario and Im in Montreal. The order was made May 27th and normally I get the boxes in a week but its been over two weeks, called on Monday, was told its in a warehouse here in Montreal, its now Thursday, still no parcels. I do a lot of orders with this company and Im going to recommend they change delivery companies. There is no reason why it should take so long to get a parcel delivered from the province next door, especially when many stores have opened up again and people re making less online orders. Also, Im tired of their out of shape postal workers who leave my parcel downstairs by the communal door instead of walking up flight of stairs and leaving them by my front door. Lucky for me, no one wants to steal books."
I don‚Äôt even want to give 1 star. This is the only Post Office that can never do anything right. How are you guys still around?! Please just shut down and give your jobs to competent people. I‚Äôm so sick of ordering things and it not getting delivered and/or lost by CANADA POST.
Never on time delivery.... They cannot still exist with such bad service: IT IS ROBBING PEOPLE... They do not know how to HIRE MORE PEOPLE when they are flooded by demands... They never modernised they delivery system and they do not care about the delivery and/or the customers... Very bad company....
Slowest and least helpful. Damn illogical issues too. A package was supposed to arrive by the end of the day and someone tries to deliver it at 2:30 AM but when I didn‚Äôt wake up they returned it to the sender and I haven‚Äôt seen it since. That‚Äôs only 1/3 of the packages I‚Äôve been waiting for. ( Intelcom actually delivered on the expected date)
I have had sent a package almost 3 weeks ago which was to take 1-3 days and it still hasn't arrived at the destination and am not able to talk to anybody about this or do an online chat. Also tried by Email and still no reply.
"My package has been sitting in Vancouver for 17 days with no updates, I understand there a pandemic but it shouldn‚Äôt take this long.

√âdit: I actually order my package on April 29 from the states hoping it would be here in Montreal by the second week of May but still nothing."
"Disgusting lack of service. It reminds me of OC Transpo here in Ottawa. No accountability for anything, they don‚Äôt care and by their website it‚Äôs obvious when looking for help. There happy to charge high prices for their delivery service but do not deliver. Two of my packages are missing, paid for Xpress. What‚Äôs the point? Items being processed for 3 days in Ottawa! Are you kidding me? You guys need to wake up"
"Still waiting for a parcel from Calgary, Alberta being sent my home in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario sent in early May which should have only taken about 2 weeks at the most...still haven't arrived by June 10. Yet garbage mail from the local companies are there the next day. I understand Covid-19 is a problem, but this is ridiculous."
"If i could I would give Canada Post a zero cannot tell me where my 2 parcels are ,one has been mailed almost a month ago will not answer where your parcel is blaming it on covid one parcel has been stuck in Winnipeg for a month now no update on Tracking since May 26 on either parcel should of learned last parcel took 3 months lots of phone calls etc.Its time to find another service Canada Post should be held accountable for our lost packages.It was only mailed from Sask going east.Taken a month to get to Winnipeg."
"If it was possible to give 0 stars I would have; My 2 packages are stuck in some warehouse, of course in Canada, no estimated delivery date provided, no nothing, there is no real customer support to answer our questions saying they have the same info like your site, your chat is a stupid robot, not possible to open tickets; money were paid for the shipping and you just ignore and insult your customers
And everything is being put on the pandemic, your lack of systems, organizing, resources or information.
Very disappointing in a public service that is paid with our money and it's supposed to serve us people
Very very very dissapointed!"
I had to send some parcels and the staff were quite helpful. Things are done a bit differently with the covid-19. And parcels take longer to get somewhere.that's life in the pandemonium Era.
"It is of course impossible to rate no star at all but that's all that would be deserved. Whereas other delivery organizations succeed in respecting their terms of service, Canada Post (packages) systematically overshoots its estimation/promise, by several days. It is very frustrating that the tracking system contains so little information on the current state of deliveries."
"Absolutely done with Canada post at this point. They are incredibly slow on a good day but now due to covid they have slowed to a halt, and are not giving any info on what is happening to your package. I understand the need to slow things and take safety precautions but this is to the point of ridiculousness, Canada post doesn‚Äôt even want you to contact anyone about your package because they ‚Äúhave no more info‚Äù, but isn‚Äôt that their job? You‚Äôre expected to silently wait on your thumbs on a package that could‚Äôve cost you hundreds of dollars, that isn‚Äôt moving, that is seemingly stuck or lost, and not contact them about it. Not to mention their customer service, when you do get to talk to them, is absolute trash. Copy and pasted responses, general rudeness and just not helpful at all. Completely done."
Would give less than one star if possible. Just terrible.
"Worst service ever. Anytime I order from Amazon and they hand off to Canada Post I cringe. I have never had a package arrive on time with them, pandemic or not. The poor service has been going on for years. I guess when your government and guaranteed employment for life who cares right?

I wish Amazon would drop them once and for all."
"I ordered 2 packages for my vehicles almost a month ago, both packages left dieppe on may 25th, I got one package almost 2 weeks ago, and the other package never came. Today, almost 2 weeks later, the tracking updated and they sent it back to mississauga. It's way over delivery date and now I'm getting frustrated."
"Waiting for a mail delivery inside of Canada over 20 days.
Ordered from United States recieved in 4 days
When a parcel arrives late the my post office sends me and my suppliers a failure delivery notice although I was at my post office that day or the day before
Time to Privatize this Dinosaur waste of tax payers money.
I complained about this so many times it ridicules they are not held accountable."
"Hey Canada Post, your service is terrible right now!! What ""external factors"" are there that make your company the only one not able to deliver a parcel on-time?!?! Why is it taking WEEKS to receive anything?!!?! I get that we are in a pandemic right now but come on, every other service provider isn't having the same issues. Then you wonder why your revenue has dropped over $190 million in the 1st quarter. Get with it Canada Post"
Multiple times ive payed for a service with a delivery standard and it has not been met.
"According to tracking, my package went out for delivery this morning and was left at my front door. No, it wasn‚Äôt. Delivery driver is lying. What‚Äôs more, we have a parcel locker, why are you delivering items to my door?

So not only are items incredibly delayed, but Canada Post is actually committing fraud now and pretending to leave items at our front doors?

Also, this item was from eBay and pricy. Because they said it was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù, which is 100% a lie, I will not be able to get my money back. Not everything is from Amazon. No private seller is going to give me my money back.

Incompetent workers who may be stealing packages. Wow, Canada Post. Didn‚Äôt think you could sink any lower."
Canada Post was bad before the pandemic but it's gotten far worse now. My package was shipped from the UK and the final tracking said it arrived in Canada on May 20th. It's been three weeks and I'm STILL waiting for it! This is ridiculous. They try to use the pandemic as an excuse for their shoddy service when we all know it was crap long before now. I wish more sellers gave Canadians more shipping options so we can bypass Canada Post at all cost.
Delivery was suppose to be between 10 and 2 today. That didn't happen. It's now nearly 20:30.
"AVOID THEM!

Slowest Company ever. I understand that services may be delayed due to COVID but every other shipping company seems to be up to speed. If anyone else is using Canada post I'm going to avoid shopping with them.
My package has been stuck at Montreal for two weeks and I still haven't received anything. I live in Toronto.

SHOCKING!"
Very frustrating service. Sad that we can't get any information about what is going on. They are going to lose so many clients with this pandemic. At this point they must be doing it on purpose. Some mail gets delivered wittin 4-5 business day still we wait for 30 days for an xpresspost package. Why not dealing with the backlogs before the new parcels?
"How can a company provide such horrible service and still be in business. My Amazon order arrived at the facility in Mississauga on June 1st. I live 4 hours away from that facility and it has been 8 days and I am still waiting, As of today they say it could take 1 to 11 days to get here. Wow!!! I have had orders so delayed that the vendor refunded me. Unacceptable."
"If could give it zero stars I would , unfortunately that's not an option.
Leave alone getting your package on time as mentioned by the delivery date on the Canada Post website you can't even track your package properly and in a timely manner.
From the package reaching Canada Post to being delivered to your door step (14 days later) their is not easy way you can even track the package, for straight 3 days the delivery date was changed and not to mention at one point it said delivered yet I only got to see the package at my door 3 hours later."
For a foreign shipper Canadapost is the horror... no Tracking possible ... what a shame in such a Country.. Lost Money because of this amateurs! Thanks for nothing!
"Absolutely abysmal.

I ordered a small parcel from Surrey, BC on 29 May, and it still has yet to arrive to me in Montreal, QC as on 9 June. I'm also expecting a gift from family back home in the States to arrive soon, but as as soon as it left the USPS network (after it left from Jamaica in NYC), it's been MIA. There is no excuse for the post to go this slow. It's infuriating. I know COVID is crippling CPC, but even before the pandemic, they were still so extremely slow in doing their job and in processing orders. Not impressed, but I don't know what other option I have."
"My dog was attacked by a Canada Post worker who cut and beat his face with mail and closed fists. Witnesses saw her attack him after she came on the property with her head down sorting through mail. My Puppy just walked down to her to greet her tail wagging and I was not even a foot away.

Recourse, a suspension. Animal Control responded to my call and deemed my dog as lovey with no penalty. There is an ongoing animal cruelty investigation to her. She is back on the same route.

Canada Post told me that every dog is a dangerous dog and asked me to sign a document stating I would tether my dog for the eight hours in which she may deliver. I refused.

Be careful of your pets. Canada Post allows those who fear pets to deliver mail, and will stand by them for the abuse!! Disguting way to conduct business!!"
"Absolutely the worst carrier of them all!

I have tried my best to boycott Canada Post but some companies still only offer shipping by this method."
I have 2 items coming through the mail that are delayed by a week or more. Canada post is trash.
"Canada post. I am highly considering not ordering from any businesses or store who use you as a delivery option. I have dealt with other couriers and they did fantastic job, however, your customer service are not train enough in solving a basic issues, and it's disgraceful-there are couriers who will lied that they made delivery attempt, when they never even made one. They prefer to write up a false slip, instead of making an attempt. How hard is it to buzz a customer living in apt building, or how difficult is it to ring or knock at someone's door who is living in a house?"
"At this point they have 21 days delays... like really ??? How come I bought from other store that doesn‚Äôt do business with Canada post and I get my delivery on time even sooner ??? Canada post need to get there sh** together or leave the job for others that are more organized!! Please, if you own a business do not do business with Canada post !!!! I beg you!!!!!!"
"All of these people mad that their packages are delayed, a few days, a week or two are just hilarious. Try having a package being sent to Quebec, just stuck in Montreal since May the 5th. Canada Post drivers themselves are good. They are consistent in their deliveries when packages are supposed to be delivered. This is just sad though. Creating a service ticket as the sender is useless, as they said they would get back to me in a week from when I sent the ticket. They didn't. I called to try to get more information and told me that the receiver should make a ticket. But just in general...34 days to be stuck in city RIGHT BESIDE the final destination is ridiculous."
"So pathetic that I've given up hope. If you have a project in mind, don't even bother to plot calendar dates for progress and completion. You can't even think about starting with CPC's track record. Now delivery dates reflect ""pending"". You get better odds in Vegas. If you are purchasing for a special date - birthday, anniversary, wedding, graduation, whatever, head to the card rack and buy a ""belated wishes"" card. You're already losing ""cool points"" because CPC is going to ensure that you miss those special occasions. I get the people on the pavement are doing their best, but management and corporate miss the mark year after year. And it's getting worse. PRIVATIZE and CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY are the words of the day, everyone."
"I have 3 order from Canada Post recently... the experience are horrible. One gone missing and resolved with seller with a refund; one late for weeks, a freaking firearm by the way; and the other one is late for almost a week and haven't got any update yet. I know the Covid makes shipping taking longer, but every other companies I worked with recently respected their ""expectation"" at least."
I pre-ordered an item on Amazon Canada a month ago. Amazon saw fit to use the service of Canada Post. My package was supposed to arrive June 4 it is now June 8th. The item is in pending hell due to the ineptitude of Canada post not being able to figure out where I live despite having ordered online multiple times at the same address for nearly 3 years. They are honestly the worst delivery service available.
"Would give zero stars if that was an option. Not sure why they lose so many packages and take four times as long to deliver anything. No business in their right mind should use them. So disappointing that we cannot support and trust a Canadian company. No excuses. Covid is affecting everyone, no reason they cannot provide faster and more accurate service. No quality control and no urgency, just disappointing all around."
UNABLE TO DELIVER: I was literally in the front yard when it says the notice was delivered. Now I dont know when & where to pick it up +++ it's a week late. LAZY LIARS
–°nada Post do not use this service Never! They liars! Save your money!!!
Absolute trash!! couriers are moving packages fine but Canada post is so delayed it's unacceptable for a federal service. Pure garbage!!!!
"Absolutely garbage company compaired to all the rest available in BC. Calling them takes 50 min on hold every time, and you get robots of people telling you to get lost pretty much. There delivery is extremely slow on top. Trying to get a package for pick up is against the rules...."
"Canada Post Is The Worst Service On The Planet!!! My package, which I paid extra on to get it to me quickly was late. The tracking showed it pass my province and go to a province farther away. I called because he obviously forgot to drop it off and all they could say was it's on the way. I didnt believe they knew it was on the way because they do not have tracking on their trucks so unless they scan the package it could be at the bottom of an ocean. Finally she admitted to it being on the wrong truck after 3 days of phone calls. Their online chat service is a joke! You go through all the questions to talk to a person and then it disconnect you and u can never speak to the same person again you have to start over from scratch. Canada post, get a descent tracking system on your truck and if you cant than you may aswell take your trucks off the road and leave the professionals ship the mail."
2 weeks and still waiting for a package that was send from a location 60 Km away from the destination. The tracking site is useless. The virtual assistant is useless. This happens virtually every time when CP is used to ship stuff. This piece of crap of a company should be allowed to go bankrupt and not be helped by the taxpayers. Any other private company that is this useless would not survive the market place.
I ordered an item from the UK about a month and a half ago only to find out today that Canada Post is sending it back because they could not find my home address. I put my correct address in and everything so I don‚Äôt see why they are doing this.
Couldn't be more disappointed by them. They are now refusing to look into any issues within 21 days of a package being shipped. Avoid at all cost.
"Sent my broken phone to Google in Mississauga from Toronto via UPS it got there the next day, Friday. Google sends it back to me via Xpresspost on Monday June 1, tracking shows delivery by end of day June 3, doesn't arrive. June 4, tracking now says ""pending"", June 5 tracking says ""in transit"". Tried the totally useless Virtual Assistant...final get an agent who ends up abruptly ending the chat, despite the fact I was courteous the entire time. Toronto to Mississauga 5 days and counting, still no phone and now no respect for our National Mail Service provider. If you have the option use another service...I know I will."
"Canada Post is pretty much useless right now. It took three weeks to get a parcel from Gaspe to Dartmouth NS. I have another parcel now in the system. It arrived in Halifax Canada Post facility on 28 May and made it to Dartmouth Canada Post facility on 6 June. A week and a half to cross the bridge, really!!. It has still not been delivered. This is our last parcel in the system. My wife and I stopped shopping online altogether due to shipping inefficiencies."
"I've never had a decent experience shipping with Canada Post. When I order a product online (that's shipping thru this trash service), I always make sure to use Xpresspost shipping that is supposed to ""guarantee delivery within 2/3 business days"" which is an absolute lie. One package I purchased on Monday was supposed to be sent with Xpresspost and be here by Wednesday/Thursday. It's now Saturday night, and after attempting to speak to a real human for two hours during their ""regular business hours"" with no success, I genuinely don't know where my package is and neither do they. The item was last processed on the Monday in a completely different province and is now ""Date Pending"". Their tools that are supposed to investigate these screw-ups like service tickets and complaints are an absolute joke. You guys seriously need to get your crap together, whenever I've ordered with UPS or Purolator, I receive my package on the date if not quicker. This company is terrible, their shipping services are awful and not accurate in the slightest, as well as the fact their customer service is a joke. The chat box does absolutely nothing but repeats the same crap, the phone line was completely backed up (I get COVID, but there's no excuse for not supporting your employees and allowing them to still get paid and work at home), and they've never succeeded in actually helping me figure out a solution to one of my many (let me emphasize, MANY) problems that THEY caused because they can't communicate."
"Absolutely unacceptable service, you've been holding a package of mine 30 minutes away from me for almost a month now, how are you guys this useless i've had deliveries from just about every other service come on time, I paid for expedited shipping to get the package here 5 days earlier, it's not almost 30 days late, why did I give you an extra 10 dollars to ship this here 30 days late, i'm staring at a tracking page with no updates, get it together everyone else has, useless company, useless service"
"Dear Canada post.

You are litterally a f!#king joke and should be ashamed. Im pissed i litterally pay for your useless asses to remain employed. You cant even put the mail in my mailbox which is very clearly present on my house. Instead you leave it on my porch to blow away in the wind. And a package that is in a town an hour away has been delayed for 2 weeks????!!!!! . you suck!!!!!!!"
"Bought an item that was supposed to come on June 1st, and it's been 4 days still nothing.
Any other delivery company would AT MOST take an extra day, How could one of Canada's largest company do worse than smaller companies that does JUST AS MUCH or if not MORE deliveries?"
"Used to have great service.
Now unreliable and erratic.
Of course the Pandemic is blamed, however now is just and excuse for bad service."
"If your only choice is Canada post you may as well just pay a taxi driver to deliver your item. It's been over 2 weeks and my item is still in ""transit"" YEA RIGHT. Garbage company. Never buy from a retailer that uses Canada Post."
"Ordered an item via bestbuy.ca. Canada Post guaranteed a delivery before June 11th, now being told by them that it will ""probably"" be delivered by July 7th. The parcel is literally 4h away from where I live. They are misleading costumers."
"Why as a taxpayer should anybody keep this terrible service going. Ordered a package out of Ireland, 10 to 12 day delivery. It has been over a month. It left Ireland May 2, and still not here. How bad can a company get before someone sees a problem. This company is a total waste of taxpayer money."
"Will be quitting Amazon because they say they can't promise to NOT use Canada Post. Too many days wasted waiting at home for delivery to avoid porch pirates in vain. Too often offended by poor customer service from a useless chat agents that can't provide truthful answers. Ridiculous tracking website provides meaningless estimated dates. Delivery person drops off ""sorry we missed you"" cards with item left in their truck when I was home. Happened many times before anyone even heard of the pandemic. They must be paid by the delivery wether it was successful or not. They don't even pretend to try.There should be a zero star option just for them."
"I know for a fact that my package has been gathering dust for a month in some container in Montreal (because of COVID19 the excuse running these days) even though the tracking info is saying waiting for package! Last time we shipped to Europe from Canada they sold us the upgrade to express post even though they later said that they can't honor the delivery guarantee with the service.. Because of a strike that stopped a month prior!
Do not sell a service that you can't provide period.
Fact of the matter is that package was going from Montreal to Europe, easy one flight and boom back to a civilized postal service again. Think again ! They sent that package to Vancouver instead then had to send it back to Montreal after it disappeared a few weeks later. Welcome to Canada Post the worst postal service on the planet."
"I have ordered a couple of items from Montreal and live south of Ottawa. It is unbelievable that it takes 6 days to travel 2-2.5 hours down the road. The parcels get sorted in Montreal only to be sent to Ottawa for sorting again before being delivered to my local PO. They are most certainly using this pandemic as an excuse as most of their sorting centers are supposedly electronic. Tried Canpar for the first time, one parcel from Sherbrooke and one from Orillia. Both were shipped on Monday and both were delivered on Wednesday. Even UPS and FedEX are slow. I will be using Canpar from now on."
They are using the pandemic as a scapegoat for their extremely crappy and slow service but in reality it has always been terrible. I avoid using Canada post whenever I can. Perhaps it's time to scrap it alltogether and revamp it.
Lost 2 out of 3 packages in the past month. I have zero confidence in Canada Post and sadly will not be using them anymore.
"Ordered some toys for my guinea pigs off Amazon, and they were delivered in 2 days. During the pandemic. Ordered some gardening supplies from Vancouver, with UPS. Delivered in the 5 days they said. During the pandemic.

So what's your excuse CanadaPost??? I only use your service when I am forced to by an online retailer and every single time its a ridiculously unreasonably long waiting period to get the package.

Even before the pandemic you were atrociously slow. And your tracking system might as well not be there because it gives cryptic information that changes with no explanation. First its out for delivery, then its not, then its back at the local sorting depot due to a 'sorting error', then its sent back out on delivery due to another 'sorting error'.

Just deliver the package. That's your job. Maybe you should consider doing it. I don't know."
"Not sure why they have a tracking system
One day it says delivery that day - then not
Next day gives you another time - then not
Then says date pending
Does not matter if you pay 10 cents or 25 dollars for delivery
All methods seem disorganized and confused
I assume this is a big budget system - somebody is obviously not very good at their job
But more so - from the top - Canada Post seems lost in space
Weird and really too bad
I know my local
Postal carrier - she is a wonderful person !"
"Gives a delivery date ,canceled it ,refuse to explain or give me a clear date.Canada post is now over their heads after years of sabotaging their own system.Bravo."
"being purolators parent company, im not surprised to see both share the same low value, low customer experience and even worse delivery service. ordered package from amazon, being shipped canada post, the seller literally just printed the shipping label and canada post has it tagged as delayed due to external issues. they havent even picked it up yet(being shipped from a city 3 hours away from me). whenever you have the choice, use any other shipping company besides these 2. this day and age, theres no and i mean no excuse for something that is shipped from another country into canada to be faster than shipping within canada. this is just getting stupid. these smaller shipping companies around need to boost thier presence all over and start knocking these monopoly companies off thier pedistal. too many monopolies in canada. bring in the competition and make jobs. canada first."
My parents are home 24/7 they did not even attempt delivery. They need to deliver the package to the address provided not just bring it to the post office. That's not how it works. People are social distancing that's why we deliver products to our residence and not to the store/post office obviously. They need to do a better job. There is literally no reason them to have not delivered the package in the first place other than laziness.
trash ive used canada post 3 times and nothing but mediocre experiences throughout the GTA. just pay more for ups hell dhl still does a better job. not saying all cp workers arent genuine but i cant vouch for cp not even a bit.
I been Waiting for my package and it‚Äôs been 10 days in transit how long does it take you guys to get the package to my house in a three hour and 26 minute drive.
Horrible service and unreasonable delays.
Canada Post should shut down. Let other carriers handle the work. Let the employees stay home and collect their checks and play video games. Pkg's and mail get stuck in their hands and hardly move. I'm receiving orders from the states weeks before orders from one province over.
My brother in law is a mail carrier for Canada Post. He is home early everyday from work since the pandemic. He is approved to drive the parcel trucks but yet is going home early?? How many mail carriers would happily boost their hours to do some parcel deliveries and why isn't Canada Post adapting and changing things up? It took over a MONTH for me to receive face masks from out west and I live in Ontario.
"Parcel sent registered with tracking on 22 April, hasn't moved from current location for ""6 weeks"" and no notification why. Called many times, they can not tell me when it will be delivered. Forget asking to get it back, they will laugh over the phone !!! The delivery due date was a month ago. Totally unreliable. Mr. Trudeau promised to get rid of community boxes and get
better control of this "" Post Ensemble "". Did He Forgot ???
Will never ever in My life use Canada Post AGAIN !!!!!!!"
"63 days for a priority envelope from US (sits in Mississauga for 50 days) and Amazon and Nespresso forget it.
What dreadful service when even mail from Toronto (40km away) takes well over a week"
"I think Canada post deserve less than one star, Don't pay extra for Xpresspost. Taken over one weeks for no reason. They blame it on the Pandemic don't trust them, They charge you high dollar for no service,

If you care about your document & Shipment, use another Carrier"
"Canada Post SUCKS!
Wost Post Company ever! They are late very late they dont update Tracking information, And so Not Worthy! DO NOT USE CANADA Post! Canada post is awful!"
"I had an item that was marked as delivered which I never received... I called Canada Post, they filled out a service ticket with me, and that was it. Nothing more. I'm waiting for a lot of packages that are being delivered by Canada post, so I don't know who this sender is, so I have no way of contacting them for a refund on my item that I HAVE NOT RECEIVED, and Canada Post won't tell me who the sender is... how am I supposed to get my refund? SUCH BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
"Unbelievable. Small parcel mailed from Calgary to Saskatchewan on April 21st, Item processed Calgary Apr 23, no further progress updates. Completed a Service Ticket waited a couple weeks, auto msg said to wait for email and ticket #. No email. Completed another Service Ticket, this time I got a ticket number, further email to be sent by May 29th. No email. Called Canada Post, on hold for 57 minutes. Finally a rep took my call, my Service Ticket had been cancelled because ???? Between the annoyingly crackly phone connection (these reps work from where?) and the heavily-accented rep, it took 30 minutes to complete another Service Ticket over the phone from scratch even though I offered to submit a third one online. Does anyone ever receive satisfactory followup from Service Tickets? I‚Äôm beginning to think they‚Äôre just a means of delay, hoping the parcel shows up in the meantime or the customer throws up their hands in frustrated defeat.

All I really wanted to know if it‚Äôs possible the small package could‚Äôve been placed in the recipients post office box without it being scanned for delivery so I can close my file. But of course the rep @ Canada Post didn‚Äôt know.

It‚Äôs absolutely deplorable how poor Canada‚Äôs Post Service is at the best of times. I think we need a Federal Public Inquiry to find out what‚Äôs going on behind the thick impermeable wall this Crown Corporation hides itself behind. It‚Äôs an embarrassment."
Worst postal service in the world. Every other popular postal service seems to have their s*** together except CP. Strongly recommend NOT using this postal service. Packages sit in Mississauga or Montreal for weeks without any tracking updates. Don‚Äôt bother paying for express shipping because they will not prioritize your package. There‚Äôs virtually no online customer service (I was unable to submit a service ticket). Called CP for help and they hung up while I was on hold. Really wish there was more communication from CP on their website and social media.
"I understand this is pandemic time and the service has been slowed down. But Canada Post makes a ridiculous job when they still unchanged the rates. Now they told me Even I paid for express service, the speed is like normal services: 3 days to deliver letters within Toronto, 11 days from Downtown Toronto to Ontario Tax Centres.

I have lived in 5 countries, used various post services and Canada Post delivers the worst."
"Horrible - worst service ever. Takes forever. Had something picked up from Mississauga. Should have been delivered yesterday, and still in Mississauga. Used UPS to ship to the states for $26, and voila they got it in 3 days."
"worst service possible. I had parts ordered and they were shipped from Ontario to Ontario and it was 12 days to arrive. For some reason they went to Quebec 1st,
I now had parts shipped from the same place, they were picked up May 20 by Canada post, it is not June 3rd and I still have not received them.
I had a watched shipped on 22nd and it just arrived today , June 3rd. I can't control how companies send me stuff but if it was up to me I would never use Canada Post"
I would give zero stars if I could! I understand there is a covid crisis but this is ridiculous. I‚Äôve had two packages come before this one I‚Äôve been waiting for since May 12! And they were from the same place! Is it lost? Am I ever going to receive it? I call now before I order anything from anyone and if they ship out Canada post I will not order from them! Call back in a month they say! OMG
"What a bunch of lazy workers!! They want more money for less work. If you live in an apartment, you can guarantee you will have to treck to a post office nowhere near you to pick up your LONG AWAITED package from Some miserable old lady that hates her existence. Get these guys out of here! If their workload is too heavy for them, lets stop using them all together!! Business was slow so you laid off all your employees and now you can't keep up. Pathetic excuse for a delivery service."
Item from richmond hill to scarborough. 30 minute drive. It has been 'in transit' for 4 days. Completely useless company.
"I suggest you try to get 3rd party shipping rather than this trash service, the only reason it's not shut down is because it government operated. WORST SHIPPING I'VE
EVER EXPERIENCED. I've waited 12 days only for a package to be ""picked up"" and it not go anywhere for a whole 12 days and counting."
"Starve them out!!!! I ordered 3 different items from 3 different companies as far back as February - all used Canada Post for the last leg of the parcel‚Äôs delivery. It is now the beginning of June and I have NOT received any of them and the tracking numbers with CP are useless. I have now decided to strick back. If companies like Amazon, etc. use CP for their deliveries, then I will resind my purchase and buy from someone else who doesn‚Äôt use CP. HOPEFULLY companies will start to get the msg that CP is useless and they need to find a different courier for the delivery of their products and if they STOP using them maybe CP will get the msg - get your s‚Äî‚Äî together or fold!!"
"I took 4 Court Documents to a Canada Post Office to be sent out ""Register Mail"" I specified that a Signature and Name of the person receiving was a must. I asked the employee if that's possible she said I had to write it on the envelope and the courier would look and follow instructions accordingly. Did what she said she charged me accordingly and when I went to track the packages to see who received them there was nothing they wrote ""signature option was not requested"". When I called CS they said they are not getting any signatures at this time because of COVID 19 however this was never mentioned to me otherwise I would have gone a different route with UPS myself private delivery anything. This is unbelievable and unacceptable. These were court documents 4 of them and I spent $150.00/ each total of $600 for these documents to get to the right people and now no one knows what happened to them and I cannot confirm delivery because I have no name no signature. I'm sorry but if your employees are not monitored and doing their job properly they need to be fired not hid behind the union. Such a disgrace of service and lies. I'm beyond upset and on my way to confront this excuse of an employee!!! UPS all the way from now on. FYI I'm a business you just lost and hopefully you'll loose a lot more after this. Location this happened was 9200 Weston Rd Piazza Villagio Plaza Woodbridge ONT, Shoppers drug Mart, on May 27/2020 1:29 pm."
"My package is over two weeks late, and no sign of it being delivered anytime soon. This company is the WORST! It's not the pandemic, this always seems to happen with Canada post. They're lazy, unorganized, and they lie to their customers. I would assume use any other service when given the chance, and will never order anything online unless it gives me an option to go with another company. I would rather pay double to another company if that means my package would be delivered on time."
"Canada post is a joke,why do we need them they lost my package even though I had a tracking number my parcel came to my city is left my city and I do not know where it is they are a joke,as a tax payer i don't see why we need them at all....."
They must have forgotten about my package. No update since two weeks and creating a ticket doesn‚Äôt help. No customer service. Best Buy should put delivery option because I will do everything to avoid post Canada
I‚Äôve had 80% of bad service with Canada Post and it‚Äôs delivery employees. It astonishes me that this company or corporation still exists. Their app is so dysfunctional and their poor service has been going on in the last 10 years with my constant bad experiences. Not sure why Amazon continues to use them.
"What is up with these guys? Expedited package, received a tracking with delivery of May 28 before end of day, mail delivery dor June 3 is here and the package still not delivered!!!!Now tracking says do not know when delivery will happen, it shows it was received in my city days and days ago. That's it, I will no longer use this service, not worth the money, they do not deliver"
Don't bother paying extra for Xpresspost. My deliver from Sherbrook PQ has taken over two weeks for no apparent reason. They blame it on the Pandemic but I don't believe it for a minute. Time to privatize the Post Office
"My package was never delivered. Rather they ""tried"" to deliver but, instead of ringing the doorbell when 3 people were home. They just stuck me with a pick up notice. This is also after waiting over a week for their ""expedited parcel"" service. I do get that they are busy but, atleast put some effort in."
Canada Post has got to be the worst courier
"I have wasted so much time, trying to get answers as to where my package is, only to be treated with disregard from a condescending customer service representative.... I‚Äôm so extremely discouraged."
"Canada Post has got to be the worst courier I have used. I sent a small package from Alberta to Toronto. The recipient address was correct but misread by Canada post. The postal code for Toronto is M and Montreal is H. If you are in the courrier business and mistype a postal code you should have a fail safe mechanism to show a city/town corresponding to a postal code if that is what we are going by to transport packages. OK... maybe human error... In any case I had attempted to contact Canada Post to ask them where the package was as I could clearly see through the tracking that it was in the wrong city. Believe it or not there is no connection between customer service and the actual courriers. They are in the dark, much like us customers. Eventually the package did arrive albeit over 2 weeks late! It's not like Toronto and Montreal are in different countries or that far from each other! And this is not the first time I have had issues with Canada Post but I had to write something this time. And I will never use them again."
"Absolute horrible service, ordered 2 packages from amazon about 3 weeks ago. The first one was shipped with ups and delivered 48h later. Now the second one hasn‚Äôt arrived yet. CP offers literally no tracking, the last update I got was almost 2 weeks ago when it reached out Ottawa and no other updates since. This is leading me to wonder if the package got lost, seriously disappointed at the level of incompetence of a service we pay for with our own tax dollars"
"That's a disaster. I understand we're in the pandemic and everything, but Xpresspost service within Toronto takes almost a week now and still hasn't been delivered. I paid extra because I'm sending important documents and need them delivered in a reasonable time. The worst way to spend money on shipping something. I'm not even going to talk about regular deliveries..."
I simply don't have words. Wish I could vote 0 stars.
Worst mail service in Canada. Never once have I ever revived my Items on time! Doesn't mater if its express or not will always end up receiving my items 2 days to 2 weeks later and the customer service is 100% useless!
This service non-existent... SHAME for Canada!
"Amazon, please please please stop using Canada Post as one of your shippers. They NEVER deliver any items on time. Even when I order multiple items at the exact same time, the one shipped by Canada Post is the only item I receive late. EVERY. F****N TIME!!!!! CANADA POST, YOU SUCK."
"I know at least 5 peoples who work at Canada post and they are loser/drug user .
So iam not impresse why its so slow ...
They are like our government ! Losers who don't deserve they salary. Bunche of stupid retardedmonkeys who work for Canada post."
"Completely useless. Any excuse they can find not to move mail, or not to work at all, they will find it. As Ronald Reagan did with the air traffic controllers, we need fire every f****** one of them and contract FED EX instead. It's not like they are working anyway, let's just stop paying them."
Unreliable. Tracking is just a false way of delaying deliveries. Quick to strike but no concern of people sometimes depending on promises made on tracking app. I'm done wirh canda post. Never sending or get anything sent to me ever again.
"For some reason, every time my packages are shipped by Canada Post they are always delayed. Would definitely avoid this company. I understand that ‚ÄúDue to Covid-19 our employees are working extra hard‚Äù but same goes for every other company that seems to be doing just fine with delivering my packages before or on the day of the ETA."
"Worst delivery service to ever exist. My package is 4 days late and still pending.Extremely disappointed with this company, it seems they can't get their crap together."
"Attention Canada Post,

Terrible services, You wondering why your company has the worst reviews, Not only your Agents do not know the system, There manager don't know either. I just got off the phone with Alex and Pam. I had sent a package out, Paid for the service and the packing is not delivery. The agent that took the parcel was an terrible at her job and made huge mistake on my package, Now I am fight with the insurance on Aug 12 2020. I sent this package in March 2020. 5 months later to be paid out 100 cad.. Be aware of Canada post are scammer. I am out of 500 usd money from my pocket. They stole my package and wont send it back to me. Took a loss, But I hope customers see this post and made aware of the situation. Don't use Canada Post Service. Stay away, Even if you do pay, They don't care."
"If I could put 0 I would. Canada post never has there crap together, packages are always lost, late, damage. I hate getting packages delivered by you guys. Even customer service and the supervisor are useless. Spend over 2 hours on hold to get no where and all they say is there‚Äôs nothing I can do at this point. Like seriously.
You‚Äôd think with all the crappy reviews you guys might start caring a little but obviously not so here‚Äôs another one"
If I have to look on ‚Äútrack a package‚Äù and see that my package hasn‚Äôt moved one more time I‚Äôm going to lose it and insure that my packages are never shipped through canada post again. Worst delivery service ever
"If I could leave 0 stars I would.
Regularly have been home awaiting a package only to receive an email saying delivery attempted. No attempt actually made not even the sticker left saying to pick it up, just lazy staff who dont want to do their job. 2 days later the sticker arrives saying to pick it up. This company is a waste of everyone's time, intelecom is 1000% better, actually delivers your packages AND send an email with a photo of your package at your door. The odd time Canada post actually does make a delivery, 9/10 it's not even to your house. Overall terrible experience with canada post."
"Take my word when I say pay whatever money it takes to keep your package out of their hands. Never once has the packages arrive on time with them over my past 4-5 years using them (occasionally-last resort). Recently bought something 20-25 days, still has yet to arrive and took 16 days to move from Ontario to NB. 5-7 to process it to get it on the truck. As well the packages are $550 and $600 (small-didn‚Äôt require oversized/overweight). The shipment was schedule to get here 10 days ago and it‚Äôs still in NB as far as I know. Could have someone fly my package around the world twice before one Canada post makes it through 2-3 provinces. ü§¢ü§Æ as well, their customer services is terrible, haven‚Äôt got one response from them via phone/email. Despite delaying orders for weeks on end."
"Would give 0 stars they should be out of business to save tax payers money, most expensive and worst service in the world probably..."
Please stay away from Canada Post at any cost. I made the terrible mistake of selecting Canada Post for delivery and now I'm waiting for weeks for my package to arrive. Just stay away from Canada Post.
Order from USA arrives in 4 days. Order within Ontario 28 days and pending. This isn‚Äôt problem of COVID. This is a problem of BULL...T. Other curriers keep delivering with same COVID-19 safety precautions and measures no problem.
"Shipments that should take 3 days, as it does any other large company like UPS or FedEx, takes 3 times as long. They claim it's because of COVID and their extra safety precautions, yet these companies are dealing with the same virus and got their sh** together! Shame on this company. It should NOT be supported by the government anymore. What a waste of tax payers' money!"
"Ordered 3 items from different companies within Ontario 2.5 weeks ago and 2 packages have no info, probably meaning they havent been scanned yet. The other package came from Aramex which was shipped from UNITED KINGDOM to TORONTO and I received that package days ago."
This the second time I have experience with Canada Post for an extended delay (>10 days) for a small package mail from Toronto to Montreal. I paid Express on May 20 and the post office clerk stated expected 2-3 days delivery. It is now 11 days later (May 31j and the item is still waiting to be scanned in Toronto. I filed online service ticket 3 days ago and the item has still not scanned.
"So, this happens frequently.... You get something shipped from anywhere across the planet and it takes 2-3 days to get to your province then it sits in a warehouse within line of sight for weeks. I had one delivery sit in a warehouse in Richmond, get sent to Burnaby, then sent to Vancouver and after it took 2 weeks just for this pointless tour of the lower mainland it eventually got sent to its destination (and was delivered within a day). What is the deal with that. The US postal service schools Canada post on almost every delivery. This was happening well before a global pandemic, and now is unbearable. They are ""prioritizing"" certain deliveries. With discussions of food shortages, they have unreasonably delayed delivery of gardening equipment for vegetables to the point where the plants I have sprouted in March/April and need to be planted SOON may die waiting for Canada post.

I don't need an apology, I need you to do your job. The USPS seems to be able to cope."
"Canada post needs to figure out what the f#*k they are doing. Every package I‚Äôve had mailed to me has been extremely delayed. 15 days now, also they don‚Äôt offer any updates on what‚Äôs happening

This was suppose to be priority mail, Canada post needs to spend a day with amazon and see how deliveries are suppose to be handled."
How about a big fat ZERO? Small parcel shipped from Alberta to BC. Canada Post took 11 days to scan it before shipping. Up to 3 weeks promised before arrival- and still waiting. Both the customer service rep and the tracking app were 100% useless. COVID is no excuse as every mail service in the world is facing the same challenge- but do no need over 1 month to ship over an 11 hour road drive. I can walk this distance in less than 1 month. No wonder customer comments are all giving 1 star. Time to PRIVATIZE this service for goodness sake.
"Too bad I can‚Äôt give less than one star. I am receiving a package from Toronto coming to Gatineau and it is ‚ÄúXpresspost‚Äù It has been sitting in Ottawa for 3 days. At this rate, give me the address of your warehouse and let me pick it up. Covid is just an excuse to continue on their incompetence. Tax payers support this incompetent organization with hundreds of millions while this is the service we get."
"They send delivery notifications for packages that are nowhere to be found. Don‚Äôt allow to create missing package inquiry till 24h AFTER the delivery date. Which means the company is already counting on themselves to do a trashy job at the one thing they‚Äôre supposed to do which is drop off boxes at an address that is clearly written on the box itself. Worst of all, after three days of missing a package, the receiver is NO LONGER ALLOWED TO START AN INQUIRY. I wish companies told me what postal service they use to deliver packages, if I knew it was Canada post I would never give the company my business to begin with."
"I have never experienced such bad customer service! Their workers behave like Imbeciles being held at gun point to work there! The attitude they give off is unwarranted, no sympathy for the crap service they offer. None of them seem to have an answer of offer any help. They said to have delivered my post but nothing arrived so I am to wait a further week to find out where it is despite having waited 10 days for an expedited service!"
"I wish I could give less than one star. The incompetence of this service is insane. If they weren‚Äôt government funded, they would have been out of business a long time ago. No matter what, they can‚Äôt keep the guaranteed delivery dates. I get there is a global pandemic, but if lesser companies can keep up, a massive, government funded company should be able to, as well. I am telling every company I order from that I do not want any of my stuff being delivered by Canada Post. Why am I paying extra when they can never deliver on time??"
"Have been trying to get an order since April. Canada Post recieved the parcel on May 13th, and there has been no updates, dont even know where the parcel is because it just says electronic information is received by shipper. It's been 16 days and not even scanned, this service is absolutely terrible. I will only be using UPS, purolator, FedEx, and any other shipping service from now on."
Awful service!!!! Item returned to sender with no explanation. Notice of delivery sent out to me inspite of it being returned to sender.... Stunningly bad
These thieves will charge you an insane amount for deadlines they cant meet. Liars and thieves. Going out of my way to make sure I never use CP again.
Why pay express for a parcel to go in 2 days when it actually takes 8 days to arrive? Why did I pay much more for nothing?
Canada post failed to securely deliver my package they left it in front of my apartment door without my signature for the package so when I got in from work it was gone! Now I‚Äôve lost out on my money and the item sent Canada Post Sucks!
"Tbh, I don't know if it's the monkey-boys in charge or the same on the sorting floor. BUT, I do know that all they have to do is cope - they've a few extra parcels 'cos of COVID.
By giving workers n95 masks (even ordinary masks give 98.5% protection if worn by all co-workers), those same can work within 2m distance to handle parcels as usual. Speed it up. Get a f'ing grip Post Canada."
"I too, am waiting for parcels from Canada Post. I thought about getting upset but realized it would be misdirected. I believe our carriers are doing the best they can given the management they receive. I believe our carriers need our support, patience and kindness. These are our neighbours, and I believe they are doing their best in a total crap situation, and with total crap management. We need to demand better from the big wigs at Canada Post."
"Worst service ever. I never got my packages. They said delivered when you go and check your mailbox it is not there. They stole several of my packages. Forget about complaining, no action is taken from the higher ups. Whenever you see Canada Post never order as you will not receive your order and will end up arguing to get a refund from the company you ordered"
I understand there are delays like it would if it was Christmas but this is getting out of hand. I have so many things getting lost and not showing up. I see things getting out of customs and just sitting in Ontario or BC. I have shipments coming from Montreal that are lost as well. Nothing is moving or just getting lost. I‚Äôm frustrated and don‚Äôt understand. If I could not use Canada post I wouldn't.
I ordered a fairly pricey package and it has been in the Winnipeg facility as being ‚Äúscanned‚Äù since May 21. After contacting Canada Post I was told that as of this week they are experiencing delays. May 21 was last week...are they just now admitting they are screwing up? And on top of that I‚Äôve been told I can‚Äôt file a claim or request a refund from my supplier until after June 5. I‚Äôm done with Canada Post and I will gladly pay extra for on time guaranteed service from a proper shipping company
"If there were a score lower than zero, I'd award that to Canada Post.
In the dictionary under ""they suck"" you'll find a description of Canada Post delivery. How can a company this bad still be in business."
"My package with a value of $270 was in BC Richmond on May 15th expected to arrive in Toronto by May 18th, and the shipment is supposedly ""in transit"". It is now May 28th and my package is still ""in transit"". I am starting to believe that they probably did not even move it out of their Richmond factory and simply just stamped on the status. I get that the pandemic has led to delays, but you could at least provide updates.. It's now about to be 2 weeks since the last status update. Indeed social distancing is important and you are prioritizing worker safety, but what I don't understand is how come I don't have any issues with UPS, Purolator, FedEx during the pandemic while it feels like you've stopped your service altogether. Note: this is not the only package I am waiting on from Canada Post. Going forward, I have requested from my sellers I will not be buying if they use Canada post."
"my order was supposed to come in about 4 days ago and each day Canada post seems to always mess up my order sending it to the wrong address and even the wrong delivery truck and no one responds and no one cares, Canada post is by far the worst shipping service I have ever seen."
"Such a horrible experience my package they did delivered to the wrong address in Toronto while I‚Äôm at Pickering.
When I I tracked my order it‚Äôs say already delivered .after that I call the costumer service
And the women I talk to,such a Rude creature .and I said it just forget it I will not get my package I considered it loss., so who ever that house where they delivered my package good luck to you I hope and I pray that you will get the
corona Virus ü¶† enjoy my stuff,you know that is valuenable that‚Äôs why you did not even bother call or txt me.you know in the box my name And cell number and address it‚Äôs there.enjoy! Karma is waiting for you!"
"Really, really bad service!

I'm waiting for a package from a Canadian company for about 3 weeks. Yesterday I got a phone call from Canada Post, I couldn't answer, they didn't let a voice message and they send it back to the sender. I see this online...

Today I called Canada Post to ask about my package. Waiting time: 10 minutes. So, I showered, I eat, I started washing my car and, after 68 minutes, someone answered the phone and told me that... she doesn't know why the package was sent back to the sender and I have to wait until the sender got it back, in order to find out the reason.

Anyway, I will never deal with Canada Post, I will refuse their delivery even if it's on time! I already blocked them on Amazon and I really hope everybody will do the same.

If I could give them 0 stars, I would...!

Losers!"
"The worst postal service ever. Horrible updates, express service is a complete failure. The corporate executives should be fired with no severance pay. this is an essential service and should be socialized and regulated/ controlled by the government."
waiting for status change from Mississauga. Sitting at date pending for 8 days now...Amazon needs to not use Canada posts. Disgusted with their service lately. No issues with any other carriers.
"Does Canada Post pick and choose who gets delivery? I have been waiting on ""Priority Post"" to deliver a package and ""snail mail"" for another for over a month. Enough with the Covid 19 excuses. Next time will not be Canada Post. Your service is horrible."
"I would give zero stars if I could. This is not a company, it is a federally funded postal service. There is absolutely NO excuse for the level of service currently being experienced, even with Covid19. Have they just set the whole Mississauga processing centre on fire and walked away from it? Create more shifts, plan appropriately, and get yourselves on track. I've had packages stuck in the facility since APRIL - it is now a few days away from June. There is no excuse. We've all pulled ourselves up by the bootstraps and found ways to perform our jobs under difficult circumstances - time to do you part Canada Post."
"Honestly, this is the worst company. Took 20 days for my package to arrive. Said on the tracking that they left a notice. They never did. Had to call and wait on hold for 1hour. The lady gave me the notice number and had no reasoning as to why the notice didn't get delivered. NEVER again Canada Post. 20 days to deliver a 45 min drive."
"Terrible service, huge delays blamed on COVID 19, which makes it even worse.... prepare accordingly, just like any other company that is still in business and has seen opportunity to do well for the Canadian communities. Shame on you!"
"If I could give no stars, I would. For years, before the pandemic their service was horrible and now...what a joke. I have camera videos of postal workers throwing parcels from 10-15ft away and hitting my front door hard enough to scratch the paint, not to mention destroying everything in my package. Of course when I put the videos online, the contacted me right away publicly to save face but nothing was very done or followed up with. I have logged countless complaints at my work as well as we get a lot of parcels / express post envelopes that go missing, damaged or delivered to the wrong address. I am an Amazon Prime member and have asked Amazon to use any other company than Canada Post. Just pathetic."
"Useless why do we pay for these clowns to do nothing?sorry never again,worst delivery system ever designed"
"Another example of how this Crown (Jewel) Company works.

I have 4 packages on my way, one of them, expedited parcel, comes from 30 km away... Canada Post got it on May 19, still not ready for delivery...

The rating system should allow a very, very small star rating for a company that is very, very bad..."
"Just terrible. I don't think I've had a package meet its estimated delivery time in about a year now. They're usually out for delivery and then get delayed with some ""processing error"" (usually delaying it by 2-3 days), and sometimes they go from ""out to delivery"" straight to ""pick up at post office"" with no delivery attempt.
Also my community mailbox was broken into 3 days ago, and they came by and just taped it off with yellow tape. No sign, or notice, or any communication of any kind. The only way I found out was a neighbour who spent and an hour in the phone with them and posted it in Facebook. I guess we're not going to get mail anymore? If they insist on making everyone use the communal mailbox, maybe secure them properly and let people know if they've been tampered with? Time to privatize this old institution."
"it took Canada Post 6 days to bring my parcel from Winnipeg to Mississauga and 10 days are not enough to take from Mississauga to Thornhill , Just 35 km away.

What A GREAT SERVICE."
"So, Canada Post Depots have many, many 18 wheeler trucks full of packages that haven't even been processed yet??
We'll never get our packages anytime soon with that backlog- what a mess! In all fairness, Canada Postal services have been inferior for quite sometime now - years in fact, so this is not new. It's just now because of Covid, it's reached a peak of no return.
I called Canada Post again this morning (don't waste your precious time of at least a 1 hour wait) for my almost 'a month late' little tiny package delivery, and all they could offer repeatedly is their apologies - like trained monkeys. They offered no information at all for way past due deliveries. They don't even know where the packages are, in transit? Where in transit?? How about telling us the truth?? We paid for the postal service and for the item ordered and we have the right to know. But I guess how can we know when Canada Post doesn't even know !!
If I ever order anything online and the vendor uses Canada Post, I will NOT order from them. I'm done with Canada Post.
And because of Covid, many of us have no choice but to order online (eg. seniors) and then we're caught up in this mess.
Let's get your union out and rehire people who would take pride in their work and in getting a job done!
It's obvious from all the bad reviews I've read, there's a problem with inefficiencies at Canada Post."
"Like the others, my package was scanned into the Mississauga facility over a week ago and no updates since. I paid for expedited and xpresspost 2-day shipping.

Why do they even give the option of they don't perform the task? Amazon, UPS, FedEx etc are all delivering perfectly fine and on time. Literally no excuse here"
"For some reason, Amazon decided to use them to deliver my order and they've had it for 5 days now with the expected time just set to ""Date pending"".

Every other delivery service I've used within the last 2 months has been more than capable of delivering on time or earlier, and to make matters worse their automated messaging system basically tells you they won't be able to tell you anything about your package and I've had friends tell me that they've basically been hung up on within the last week.

Incompetence at its finest."
"I live on Jacob Sq. In Brampton Ont. We have a Mail woman that is replacing. Her name is Michelle, WOW what an efficient worker she is. Always greeting us with a smile, wishing us a great day, mail always on time. She is a joy as a person. Should have more mailman (woman) like her. Great job Michelle."
"I would give less stars if i could. Its been a week since my parcel left Richmond BC, i live on Vancouver Island. Date changed to""Pending"" and i have been told its in transit. To where? They told me there is nothing that i or they could do. Well they could do th fn job, i have witnessed a canada post van just driving around town this week not delivering a thing. I followed it yesterday for a hour and the clown didnt even deliver a single parcel. I live in a very small town and he was literally just cruising around."
"Every other shipping service I use in Canada (Amazon, Purolator, FedEx) is faster and more reliable than Canada Post. Canada Post take forever and has on multiple occasions delivered my packages to the wrong address or wrong mailbox. No other shipping service has done that to me. The customer service is okay but not great. Unless you have no other option you should never use Canada Post."
It's a state enterprise with lots of funds and they are incapable Even in pandemic or normal situation to be on time... Even with expedited shipping! I have 3 packages stuck somewhere with no news they are all expedited shipping and past delays that are reasonable... I always prefer other carriers more reliable than this unorganized Canada Post
0 stars their a bunch of fn ass holes
"Twice now I have made sure I was home to receive my canada post parcels. Neither time did they come to my door, instead saying they left a notice to go pick up at the post office. I wouldn‚Äôt have an issue if they had actually left a freaking notice. Both times now I‚Äôve had to call customer service to get my notice number because apparently they can‚Äôt find the parcels at the post office without it. I‚Äôm so frustrated."
"Well canadapost continue to be largely useless at providing a postal service in canada. I have waited since 13th May for a delivery from google, the status does not even update beyond saying label printed. This update on a daily basis...get on with it!!! With fedex I got packages within 48hrs, amazon has also got many to us during the pandemic. This virus excuse will be gone and replaced by another pandemic before this pathetic canadian institution sorts itself out. Alongside ICBC they have to rank as nothing more than an embarrassment to what is an allegedly developed western country. Laughable organizations taking Canadians for a ride. I look forward to their business collapsing entirely."
"LOL Canada Post has taken away any way to contact even their automated online help service, so even the robot is no longer providing the bare minimum customer service. My package is 5 days past the promised delivery date and its location has no been updated a single time since CP received the item. Date of arrival has been set as pending and not updated. I spent $150 on a package shipping WITHIN the province, 2 HOUR DRIVE AWAY. Why is it so hard to let me know what the hell is going on?? I would love to be able to request a refund for a late or lost package, but you can't do that unless you are the sender! Wow, how helpful. I seriously can't wait for CP to go out of business for good. I will celebrate."
"Would give them a minus 10 star review if possible. I have been screwed over several times using them to deliver parcels with gifts etc for family members across Canada and they typically lose them. Filling out a tracking request is useless as they never reply. Follow up phone calls result in long waits standard boiler plate replies. Please do all of Canada a favour - go bankrupt, stop wasting government & our money and let the real experts Fedex / UPS etc do what you can't seem to do. Actually most other G20 countries seem to have more reliable, affordable and traceable delivery systems. You are all a joke in the delivery industry!"
Still waiting my packages 1 month and half later. Im done with this company
ordered skincare on the 31st now its the 27th OF MAY!!
"Parcel started in Mississauga,Ontario. 2 hrs from my home in Ontario, it was then shipped to Richmond B.C then Alberta then Winnipeg and now its been in Winnipeg for 3 extra days collecting dust."
"My three packages were all stuck in the Canada Post. The earliest package was there since late April. So Canada Post had an entire one month vacation doing nothing. Until May 25, you can still see the latest update in their website was around April 23. What the heck are they thinking now? OK, seen from their website update, they are now concerning about their own employee's SAFETY issue. That seems a good excuse to rest at home and take the benefit of CERB. Why not?

Canada Post, you should realize you are creating a future debt to your customers, and this invisible debt would be finally paid somewhere and sometime in the future. We don't want to hear how much difficulty you are facing. That could be simply because you were lazy and did nothing in the past month. Don't trick public like an idiot that how much volume you've got and how important is social distance. They are all excuses and technically solvable. You just cite the data on May 19 to prove your work load, then where were you in late April? Physical distance is towards normal folk without professional protection. That won't be a reason you cannot protect your employees. You face no more danger than staffs in hospitals and supermarkets. To my knowledge, you are almost a shame of Canada, slowest and most arrogant as compared to the other coutries and other carriers."
Absolute worst experience . I order hundreds of packages on Amazon when I see Canada post as the shipper I get upset I've not had one successful delivery with them... I'm not in a remote spot I'm in Calgary ..
"Canada Post how come these days the US Post Office - UK Royal Mail etc. all seem to move the mail in their countries and the only problem they have is once the mail arrives here to Canada?? FedEx - UPS - Purolator Canada can deliver their parcels still so how come you can't???

I get the times we are in - 3 of my immediate family work in high risk areas of health care & they work all their shifts and even work OT when short staffed BECAUSE they care about their important work and their essential need!

Maybe your staff could care - even a little about the essential service they are expected to provide to Canadians - you have done everything you can to justify to Canadians that you are unable to do your job.

No wonder why so many foreign sellers absolutely refuse to ship to Canada - by mail anymore due to the poor service which reflects on them as sellers!
You would be hard pressed in Canada to find ANY business or Government entity that is held in such LOW regard by Canadians as Canada Post!!!"
"Seriously the worst company to exist on earth. They've never once successfully delivered our packages to our building. It's the same bs every time, ""incomplete address"", ""failed delivery attempt"". They have the most incompetent employees ever to exist. We see them in the neighbourhood almost every day and they're either chilling doing nothing in their truck, or they're just walking up to doors, MAYBE making an actual attempt, and then walking away with the package EVEN IF you use THEIR delivery preference option to leave it at your door. You would think that despite their horrific delivery service that they would at least have helpful customer service support. Nope, that's trash too. You will never get anything accomplished through Canada Post, not even a crumb from customer service. You're better off travelling to wherever your package is coming from and do it yourself because they sure won't do it. They don't deserve 1 star. In order to receive any star it means you did something right, and they even can't do that. For everyone's sake, wipe out Canada Post and let it be something only ever mentioned during campfire horror stories."
"I have an Amazon Prime subscription, which I use a lot, and it has been terrific during the pandemic as it avoids contact with others.

On April 28, 2020, I ordered some books on Amazon, and I was initially advised the item was expected by May 7, 2020, but the item would be late. Unfortunately, Amazon had arranged for the delivery through Canada Post expedited. Canada Post apparently attempted service at 7:30 am before my office was open, then returned the item to the Burlington depot, where the tracking information still today indicates the item had not moved since May 13, 2020. No pick up slip was left on the door, but I understand that pickups are not to occur on account of COVID19. Anyway, three times thereafter I followed up with Canada Post, and, in response to my last attempt -- ticket #0135869016, submitted May 19, 2020 -- Canada Post advised me this morning that the item is still not delivered (stating the obvious) along with instructions to follow up with the sender (Amazon) to sort out the issue, as Canada Post will not do anything further. So much for customer satisfaction, after wasting about 3 hours waiting to speak with someone at Canada Post, then being provided a bunch of false assurances and new deadlines.

Fortunately, through Amazon live chat, the customer service rep agreed to replace the items ordered (about $200 worth) at no extra charge, and with the ""fastest carrier possible"" who would specifically NOT be Canada Post, as Canada Post apparently drops the ball fairly reliably. The downside is that the birthday for which the books were purchased has already passed, which is unfortunate, but in my view, better late than never.

I have never had any issues whatsoever shopping online, so long as Canada Post is not the carrier, and my experience with Canada Post has consistently been horrendous. I would strongly discourage anyone -- Amazon included -- from ever using Canada Post, as they are an infamously crappy service that cost taxpayers a lot of wasted tax dollars. As a receiver, I cannot even file a complaint with Canada Post, as the complaint must come from the seller, in this case Amazon. I imagine Amazon will recoup from Canada Post, but, quite apart from every customer whose package arrives late if at all, it is tax payers who ultimately suffer when items are lost or stolen (which is a violation of the Canadian Criminal Code).

I look forward to when this failing public service implodes and is privatized."
Ordered a package to Austria. It was picked up on Mar. 17 by Canada Post. It got processed five times at the same facility with two Label corrections. On Mar. 30 it was re-routed due to processing error. It is now May 26 and there is no trace of the package. I hope the seller can do something about it.
"As other reviews, several of my packages have been changed to ""Date pending"". Stuck in postal limbo with no further information to be hoped for from CP and their terrible customer service copy-pasted responses. You would assume that CP with have a larger scalability for deliver than other companies to deal with the issues going on, or just the general capability to hire more temporary workers to meet demands from the large pool of currently laid off employees. Every other delivery company has been managing to make deliveries with no trouble for me so far, meanwhile CP only cares about packages from Amazon.

Where available I'll be making a point to avoid CP and request anywhere I order from, including Amazon, to do the same, both now and in the future."
"I ordered a 600$ item from amazon I live in Toronto , I didn‚Äôt know the vendor was going to use Canada post bc how would I know it didn‚Äôt say anywhere on amazon or on the vendors info. Canada post picked it up May 14 and that‚Äôs all the delivery progress shows on Canada post website. Literally could be stolen. I called and said hey it‚Äôs now past expected delivery, it says date pending, and there‚Äôs no report on what happened to it after u guys scanned/picked it up from British Columbia. They just gave me a service ticket and said oops btw ur vendor only covered you for 100$ coverage and we don‚Äôt call things stolen we call them ‚Äúlost‚Äù and oops we will give u a reply on ur service ticket in 5 days. So now I have to wait a week to find out if my $600+ Item is lost.... Canada post I don‚Äôt presume to know how to fix your poorly run organization. But I can say now that I now what business is like with you (usually all my amazon purchases are fedex or purolator) I am going to go out of my way with all vendors and Sites to specifically talk crap about you and request and ensure the vendor uses another company other than you."
"I know that due to Covid 19 the shipping on items will be delayed and I'm fine with waiting as long as it takes for my package to come. That being said, the lack of information I've been given is appalling. It's like losing your mom in a grocery store, sure you'll probably find her at some point but the time without her is excruciating.

I ordered my item on the 10th of May, the online tracker had finally said that my package was picked up by Canada post on the 19th and was supposed to arrive by the 21st, ""Great"" I thought, ""Now all I have to do is wait a few days and relax."" Oh how naive I was. When that faithful day came... and went (of course) I received no other information.

Now it's the 26th of May and for five days the progress bar hasn't moved and the header still says ""Date Pending."" Like I said, given the current situation I am perfectly fine with waiting for awhile, but not knowing if my $203 package (After tax) is en route or lost in the fifth dimension is a little bit frustrating.

The least the tracker could do is give you a rough approximation of where the package is, instead of the the useless little blue bar that it gives you. Seriously what am I supposed to do with that information? Make a graph?

Although I am okay with waiting as I have said many times, I wanted to do a bit of easy math just to get an idea of how long It should or should have taken Canada Post to deliver my item. The results are, uh, informative.

As a recap, My package was picked up by Canada post on May 19th. That means that without factoring in the fact that it was supposed to arrive on the 21st, my package has been in transit for a full week. Since Canada post delivers from 9 am to ""As late as"" 8 pm on Mondays to Fridays we can accurately assume that at best they have 11 hours every day make deliveries.

Multiply that by five and you get 55 hours every week to deliver mail. Now let's think about how long it would take for them to get my item from a distribution center to my house.

From what the admittedly unreliable online tracker says, my package originated in Brampton Ontario, I live in Etobicoke Ontario. According to google maps, that distance, traveling at the speed limit and adhering to current traffic would take... tw.. twwww... *sigh.*

Twenty four minutes.

I'll be generous, let's say that because of the stops along the way, that the 34km route between the distribution center and my house takes 2 hours on a good day to get through. I'll also throw in another 2 hour delay to account for the Covid 19 safety measures and the general disorganization that is going on right now.

So after all that, even if it were to take a delivery driver four hours to complete the 34km trip from Brampton to Etobicoke, they would still have enough time to deliver my package at least twice (11/2=2.75) in one full work day. And to add insult to injury, they have the time to deliver my package at least 13 times during a five day work week (55/4=13.75)

The fact that Canada Post has had (Approximately) the opportunity to deliver my package a total of 13 times this week and haven't, all while telling me absolutely nothing the whole time just goes to show how mismanaged they are and how unprepared they were for any sort of sudden high volume deliveries.

I also wanted to mention that my Amazon packages, thankfully not sent via Canada post, have been arriving within three to four days after ordering them and are almost always arriving days, even weeks before the estimated delivery date. Even Amazon items that I've ordered without Prime shipping have arrived in a timely manner that is perfectly on par with the times I would get before the pandemic.

As for why I wrote this run-on, wordy, novel of a review, it's because I want to deliver a message to Canada Post. If a somewhat busy 9th grade high school student takes time out of his day to write something as ridiculous as this, they might just figure out that they need to make some changes."
"I have requested Amazon to NOT ship ANY STUFF I ORDER WITH CANADA POST EVER AGAIN!!!!!!! If enough people do this, perhaps some changes on how inept Canada post is will invoke change. Waiting over 2.5 months now for parcels being held hostage by Canada post!!!!"
worst customer service ever! hour long wait times to speak to a representative resulting to you basically being told that they do not know where exactly your package is and when you can expect it. Extremely disappointed. I'm sure they'll just use covid as an excuse..
"Wish I could rate them 0. Coronavirus aside, I ordered something on Amazon and it shipped from Israel of all places on April, 21st.
It didn't arrive in Mississauga till May, 11th, which is fine [long way]. But then it took 11 days to get to Calgary with the destination being Red Deer. Now for whatever reason It was sent to Edmonton????
Which also took 3 days. So now it has to come back south to my residence. Updated today on May, 26th package went from Edmonton then 10 mins out of town to Nisku then back to Edmonton, still haven't received it.

What a joke."
Honestly if I could rate Canada post zero stars I would. I know that due to covid-19 there‚Äôs gonna be some delays but 2 week delays? I ordered something from amazon and it came before the delivery date... Also the fact that it said ‚ÄúDate pending‚Äù really irks me because i expected it to come may 7 and it still hasn‚Äôt come. It‚Äôs now may 25... Canada post is honestly the worst shipping company. Do better
"I understand the delays due to covid - that‚Äôs not the issue. Marking a package as ‚Äúdate pending‚Äù the day after I was supposed to get it is what bothers me. At least update me on where it is, or give me an estimated wait time. For all I know it‚Äôs lost on the middle of the highway. Also why even put an option for a ticket if there won‚Äôt be a response in a respectable amount of time??? I assume that won‚Äôt be answered either until the thing arrives at my house. Why can bottom tier shipping facilities like DHL get a package here in 4 days and not Canada post????"
"The package shipped from BC to an hour away from my house in saskatchewan. It continued to sit there for three days. I called and asked if I could just go pick it up since the next day was Friday and my package is very expensive, they said no if it‚Äôs not there by June 3rd (2 weeks past the delivery time) then I should start to worry. The next day, it shows my package was shipped to manitoba! 8 hours from my house!! So I called and made sure they had the right address and then they say ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not there by June 5th start to worry‚Äù, so essentially every time I cal they‚Äôre just going to say if it‚Äôs not here in two weeks from when you called then start to worry. What a joke, pathetic that this kind of incompetence is coming from a government organization. Only used Canada post to try and show some government support but I see that was a mistake I won‚Äôt be making again."
"I understand the extra safety measures and Christmas-level parcel volumes Canada Post is dealing with due to COVID-19, but some action should be taken here. It took Canada Post over a month to deliver a parcel from Mississauga to Barrie (100 km distance). UPS, on the other hand, delivered my parcels within 3 days."
Canada post sent my package to the wrong address I contacted the vendor first to make sure the address was correct on their end before contacting Canada post. They verified that address with me and told me to contact Canada post. I phoned the first time and all I got was an automated thing telling me they are recieving a higher then normal call volumes and they can't take my call and to call back later said goodbye and hung up. Called a second time got through was on hold for 40 minutes they only tell you your wait time is over 10 minutes nothing more specific. I get through talk to this lady she asked for my tracking number then my shipping address I tell her that and she says I'm sorry I can't give you any more details about that order because the addresses don't match and tells me to contact the vendor. I told her I did and they verified that exact address I gave to her then she proceeded to say well we can't ship packages to imaginary addresses..... very professional the entire time they wouldn't even admit they could have made a mistake even when I verified the shipping address with company who shipped it.
"Beware of Canada Post Flex Delivery Service, they will send your packages to whatever post office they feel rather than the one you have selected. What's even better is they will manage to find a post office at the opposite side of the city from the one you selected! No exaggeration at all, they literally picked the post office that was furthest away from the one they were supposed to deliver to. Great job Canada Post. It's not like this system was specifically designed for convenience or anything. They might also try to blame this laziness on covid-19, even though the post office I ordered to is completely open and accessible to the public (and has been this whole time-in fact I have picked up other packages there). There are also many other nearby post offices they could have picked as well, but chose to be jerks instead. Apparently according to them I should have known this would be the case when I ordered this item in February, even though there were no restrictions in Canada in place at that time. Unless you can predict the future be prepared to get screwed. Also their online ""support"" seems to just go directly to the trash bin.
If you want a system that randomly delivers your package to the furthest, least convenient location in the city, then Canada Post's Flex Delivery System is for you!! What are you waiting for? Sign up and start ripping your hair out in frustration with the rest of us!"
"The words DATE PENDING will always leave a sour taste in my mouth. I ordered $200 Nikes on the Sportchek website 5/14. Delivery 5/20. ‚ÄúOut for delivery‚Äù and would be here by ‚Äúend of day.‚Äù At 8:00 PM on 5/20, after my expensive shoes DID NOT ARRIVE, I go onto the website, the tracking page.... and my heart almost stopped... DATE PENDING. ‚ÄúYour item will be delivered later than expected...‚Äù and then the website further states that THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE ITEM IS.

What kind of national service is this? Are my expensive Nikes LOST SOMEWHERE? Perhaps a lawsuit will get them here quicker!

From Sault Ste. Marie Canada"
"My package from the US arrived on time and in good condition, but I was surprised by the extra fee they charged for the ""service"" of collecting HST on behalf of the Government. The fee almost doubled the shipping cost!

I would suggest using UPS or another courier for import shipping. In my experience, they tend not to collect a separate fee for the privilege of collecting Canadian taxes."
"There should be a no star option.
Canada post is a joke, my aunt send me documents on April 10 they should be delivered in 3 days because of the covid they said it may take up to two weeks,
Well the tracking showed delivered to the country of destination on May 22nd
I checked the cargo and delivery flights between the countries were not impacted.
Canada post is a bunch of lazy people who go on strike every year what a disgrace.
Definitely will never use their service again."
"First order sent mid april......5 out of 8 packages have been ""date pending"" for over a month now... all of them sitting in Montreal or The Mississauga Triangle and I'm less than 10 hours from montreal facility. Figure it out. You're just embarrassing yourselves... have been for years. Please deliver the products owed to me. Bunch of thieves.....

Update.... June 5th and still no packages..."
"no where in the world is post like in Canada! this is unacceptable using covid 19 as an excuse! parcels within Canada talking up to 3 months???Canada Post suspends service to 60 countries amid pandemic | Young State
TORONTO ‚Äî Canada Post says it is no longer providing delivery services for mail and parcels to dozens of countries around the world as the novel coronavirus spreads. The organization, which is considered an essential service, is taking several steps to protect its workers and other Canadians. The postal service made the announcement Monday but did not say when the temporary disruption would end. Spain, Portugal, Poland, Russia, Turkey etc THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE"
"We literally cannot get any packages delivered. WEEKS have gone by the expected delivery dates, all packages just stuck in limbo. CP has been pathetic for years but this is just unprecedented. Calling it ""delays"" is an understatement, their system has completely collapsed. You can't blame this all on covid, the other couriers are moving along fine. SELLERS STOP USING CANADA POST!!! YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR PACKAGES!!!!"
It sucks! don't order from them they lie and take way too long
"Ordered a couple parts through amazon, With 2 day expected shipping. Well after canada post received the package, That 2 day wait went up to a 14 day wait... After 15 days, the package has still not shipped from the facility it was delivered to. Worst shipping company by far, Do not chose them if you can help it."
"I'm missing 3 different items that were shipped to me in April. Seriously. They have been ""stuck"" in mississauga and BC for weeks. Tracking is not working. Customer service is non existent. How can they be this bad??
I've created online tickets but I'm guessing its useless based on the reviews."
"Two months and I still have not received a couple of orders, why does anyone use this service. Other couriers still continue to get parcels out in the same amount of time as before Coronavirus but not Canada Post. Figure it out Canada Post!!"
"I‚Äôve had this happen so many times, but recently, amid the coronavirus situation, Canada Post has truly proven that they are obsolete. How and why we have to put up with this is beyond me. Expected delivery dates of April 22nd, May 5th and May 15th have all come and passed, with absolutely no indication of when they will ACTUALLY be coming. All 3 packages have been within 30km from me for the past couple weeks and in one case, for over a month. I went into my local post office (they‚Äôre very friendly there) and the woman behind the counter (who works for Canada Post) told me not to rely on Canada Post for deliveries, as they just can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be able to meet the demand."
"A package that takes 2 days , is taking more than 2 weeks in arrive and now they are showing ""Date pending"" , that means that they don't have a clue where the package is"
"Ordered international priority express, almost two months ago. $60+ for this service that is not provided. This is one of many packages I'm waiting for, for much too long... Why charge me for that service if you are not going to provide it. Not the only one with this complaint it seems. Update your website, disable those options CP! I will go out of my way when ordering anything in the future to MAKE SURE the seller will not use Canada post. I'm willing to pay more for this. Example of a reason ei. Not knowing where Vaughan Ontario is, while the package is LITERALLY in a post office in Vaughan Ontario. I am so done with the negligence and excuses from CP."
"Id like to start off with its not the employees fault, they big wigs should have find a way for things to run smoothly even during these times. I get holding a package for a few days as covid lives anywhere from 24 hrs to four days on surfaces but rhis is ridiculous. I run a small business and ordered supplies I am running low on. Its already hard enough during these times running a small business but they've made it harder. My items shipped on the 12 and arrived in my city om the 14 where they sat for the next 7 days before they sent them back to the originating city for no reason so now I have no supplies and no money to buy them from elsewhere. I'd give them negative stars if I could. I get times are tough but they've been complaining about being over worked for years. I've got packages that have sat in the same city for an entire week."
I ordered spa chemicals and the tracking number I was given isn‚Äôt even linked up ...called customer service and they passed it off to the company. No trace of it and can‚Äôt help me. Spa company shipped it next day after ordering so where is it!!!! I realize Covid is slowing things and more people are ordering online right now but how is this any different than Christmas when it gets extra busy...hire temps...lots of people need jobs right now! Worst service and I will go out of my way to never use them again!!
Get rid of Canada Post! Updates on tracking reverting to status from a week ago. No package delivery for over one month - still waiting from a location 4 hours drive from where I live. No customer service. Online tracking not working. Rude employees at counter. Unbelievable. Waste of money. Give business to competition. Bad bad bad. Minus 10 stars.
"This is terrible service. Their excuse is the pandemic that's why their process has been slow. Really??? Other shipping companies have figure their system and update their tracking. Why not just close down these shipping company. Terrible service, very slow, customer service is a joke. 3 weeks in my package is still on hold in a facility in Ottawa which is 35 minutes away from me."
"They charge me more for express shipping and they cant provide, the package got here 2 weeks later than the estimate was. They should not charge for something they can‚Äôt provide. I spoke to customer service and they say theirs nothing they can do. I know theres is a pandemic running right now but dont charge people for something you know you cant do properly do. Offer only regular shipping. STOP steeling our money you thieves."
"I'm curious how Canada Post expects people to understand their tracking system. I have 2 outstanding orders which right now are 2 weeks old, both have made it to Mississauga and both were to have been delivered yesterday and were not. Now tracking says delivery pending for the first order - huh??? and the other order tracking says May 28 Ready to Go???? Funny thing is I had another order that was delivered by Purolator today for an order I did 2 days ago. Purolator has my vote! Canada Post is a waste of time."
"Absolutely ridiculous. Canada Post needs to get their act together, whether it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù or not. My package was picked up from Calgary, lost in transit for 2 days, showed up in my hometown, THEN departed my hometown to go 5 hours away only to be sent straight back our way. UNBELIEVABLE!! How do you even mess that up? They need to pay more attention to what they‚Äôre doing and figure out how they‚Äôre going to deal with their discrepancies. Unacceptable. So fed up."
"WORST of the Worst!
The customer service is just as useless as it‚Äôs online tracking results. The entire outfit is a huge mess! Never ever use them if you can help it. Get your stuff overseas so you don‚Äôt hv to deal with them. I am not saying the other couriers are 100% dependable but for whatever it‚Äôs worth they are never-never as bad as Canada Post and the worst thing is they are taking full advantage of Covid by blaming EVERYTHING on it including their sh*#ty tracking update failures!"
"Probably the worst service I've ever had, they say that they are promoting small businesses but how can you when you legitimately don't have the staff to do so?"
"ZERO star...

How can management sleep at night? I will NEVER NEVER used Canada Post again. Worst service ever. How can they charge $15 express service on May 13 and I still don't have a delivery date???"
"$)&: you Canada Post, 6 packages. 4 delivered 2 weeks late and 2 of those that arrived at your Mississauga sorting facility a week before the 4 that were delivered are still sitting there.

This has nothing to do with delivery volume and proof it is pure incompetence.

Shut your doors and send everyone home."
"So I ordered from Amazon and another online retailer same day from same province (BC). I get updated shipping from Amazon and 3 days later my parcel mysteriously appears. Canada Post scanned the package the next day as picked up in BC. 5 days later no updates, no parcel, no one knows where it is and no one seems to care. This is the same service as before the pandemic. Canada Post is shouting ""Coronavirus"", and doing less. I don't want to hear excuses. I want to know why Canada Post gets away with it. 2020-06-06 another parcel same issue not here yet, and no updates. The real issue is Canada Post continues to have articles stating Christmas levels of packages, and, well, Christmas is coming. What will be the excuse come Christmas? Other businesses in a similar position have hired up and made a plan. I don't see articles from UPS, or Fedex, etc touting their ""unprecedented levels"" every week. How long do I have to locked up with Canada Post? Can we do something please?"
"I have been waiting 5 weeks for a package that came from Europe. At point of shipping it indicates that its in Canada now.....has gone into the Black Hole called Canada Post. This organization should be labelled a criminal organization for the prices they charge for the world's worst postal service. Hey Trudeau, get your act together. Canada Post hires the most incompetent management in the country."
"Disgusting ""service"" lost two packages. Gone..One sent in early March and one in early April. Useless company. Rude workers (most but not all!!) and customer service (always pointless), if you can even call it that. Get with the program. So annoyed. This is not just since COVid 19. Shame on the crown cooperation CP= garbage. Service of 1921 in 2020. Go with DHL, fedex or UPS. I'VE never had an issue and they deliver at a good pace. Things need to change. Especially for the prices we pay with canada post. Criminal and they're never accountable! Very sad!!"
"Literally the worst delivery service on this planet. It sucks. If you're ordering something online go with Fedex or a different company. Even if it says a quick expected date, don't believe it. I understand that COVID 19 is a huge issue right now, but it seems the other delivery companies have figured out how to continue working quickly. Even if you have to pay more for another company, don't go with Canada Post."
"Terrible. A friend sent a package on May 4 and it‚Äôs now almost the end of the month. Checked online, item is in Montreal since May 8, no further details. Called 800 number, and they said they only have access to what I can see online. So what‚Äôs the point in having customer service when they can‚Äôt do anything? Useless entity, government ran s*** hole. Go UPS or some other delivery service because these guys are morons."
"completely awful. I ordered 2 items, a mouse and a mousepad, both of which were ordered on the same day and at the same time. the mousepad had arrived when expected and had shown up to my house the day it was shipped. the mouse however, had been shipped, and for 2 weeks and counting, it still has not arrived. it was supposed to come 1 week ago and nothing has changed on the order details on the website too. they have awful customer sup[port that basically refuses to help, and hangs up when a customer wants to know what's taking so long. they'll end up saying that tHeY cAnt dO aNyThInG aBoUt iT. I understand the world is on lockdown and were in a global pandemic, but if a company like Amazon, which isn't known for shipping specifically, delivers faster than a shipping company (Canda Post), then it becomes a problem. I would not advise anybody to use this service."
If I could give a zero I would. I completely understand we are going through a pandemic right now but this is ridiculous. My package was sops to be here a long time ago. They are summer clothes. My husband is in the navy and we had to quickly pack up and move back home to Nova Scotia. We don‚Äôt have any summer clothes here because we had to leave it all in Quebec till her gets his permanent posting message for here. We haven‚Äôt gotten mail in over a week and haven‚Äôt received our monthly bills. Canada post is going to screw our credit if we don‚Äôt get our bills on time. I called and waiting on the phone for 30 minutes only to have a man come on to basically tell me to stop complaining. The best part is they hung up on me twice. I said I will drive to any post office to pick it up and they told me no. Thanks a lot Canada post.
"Don't see a star off the grid otherwise i would use it.
Mailed a letter to Spain a month ago. It still has not arrived. When I went to mail it, she had to put it through the gauge twice. This, in spite of it being a standard envelope with a small piece of cardboard and a small flat key attached with a piece of duct tape.
Cost nearly $5 and no tracking for this price.
Based on past experience, Canada Post has to be the worst in the world.
I don't use it anymore. Rather go to the states and mail from there.
TIME TO PRIVATIZE it for better service and savings for tax payers."
"CP is an absolute joke. I understand the times may delay a package by a day. I decided to pay the extra shipping to have it expresspost, but that doesn't mean anything to them. No wonder they lost the medical ppe contract to Amazon. It's been 13 days to have a package sent from Ontario to BC. I could have hopped on a bike and cycled to Ontario and back quicker than they can deliver."
Awful service been waiting over 2 weeks for my package that was suppose to come May 4th if they can‚Äôt handle delivering packages why are they still picking up orders from places like Best Buy
"Each time they are worst, I've been waiting my package for more than 20 days, they didn't respond or say something what is happening.
Sellers shouldn't use Canada Post, really is disappointing"
Something needs to be done about how slow they are to deliver. It's a real joke.
Online tracking system is far behind competitors. Compared to amazon this company is stuck in the stone age.
"Canada Post should be abolished. Put those greedy union ""workers"" out of work.
Abysmal service, worse than some third world countries."
"They are using covid as an excuse to be even lazier. Why cant they drop an item off at my door and walk away.

Canada post has always been horrible."
"Service with Canada Post is terrible and so slow . Although I realize COVD19 can cause delays I have been waiting for medical supplements coming from the US. With USPS they took over 3 weeks to get out of the country . They were mailed on April 13 and I paid the equivalent of $41 Can to have them sent International Air Priority. They arrived @ customs in Missauga , Ontario on May 8 and transferred to Canada Post. Package has been sitting there for almost 2 weeks, waiting for clearance. In comparison, I had a parcel sent UPS to Vancouver from the same state, Minnesota and it took 2 weeks door to door. I would highly recommend UPS or Fedex and avoid Canada Post ."
"I wish i could give -100 to canada post. WORST EVER. Fed ex is much better than CP. They picked my package two weeks ago still undeliverable and no status at all. The customer care people dont know anything, i don't know why they even have customer care if people there don't know anything. Canada post sucks"
Ordered a package and everything seemed fine. Canada Post never comes to my door and I get a message saying item being sent back to sender. This is the only company that can't find the house and puts no effort into calling my phone number.
Been waiting for my daughters birthday present that was shipped a month and a half ago from Ontario to Nova Scotia. Absolutely zero tracking information on Canada Post website. Hasn‚Äôt even been processed yet according to that. This is the second parcel in 5 months that I had just disappear into thin air with Canada Post. At Christmas my mom sent a big box of presents for my kids that never arrived and now this. Seems like the more interesting the package it is the more likely it is to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù. Never had mail disappear in all my life until online ordering became a thing. Seems like it‚Äôs a free for all and some workers see something they like and ‚Äúlose it in transit‚Äù because hey mistakes happen right? Really frustrating since I‚Äôve applied for a couple of job postings and can‚Äôt get a job with them. Guess I‚Äôm not corrupt and/or incompetent enough.
I can receive a package from Vancouver to Toronto through any other delivery service overnight without issue. Send next day guaranteed trough Canada Post from Laval Quebec to Toronto and it takes 12 days. Their service sucks. The weather man is more accurate..Take your money for a GUARANTEED service and don‚Äôt give you the service you paid for. Should be charged with fraud and shut down.
Awful. They‚Äôre not built for the year 2020.
"Canada Post has always been late delivering anything that ends up being shipped through them and the tracking is always bad, I am currently waiting on a package thats supposed to be here today but is still in Montreal, I have another package I am waiting for that is 5 days late as of right now. I called Amazon and let them know I dont want to have Canada Post handle my orders any more so they ""de-prioritized"" Canada Post and I hope it works. I would rather wait 1 month more for something that is going to be on time than to be receiving another late package from Canada Post. also, every other courier that has delivered beside Canada Post has always every single time been early or on time."
Canada post hangs up phone on you when asking a question.
"What else can one say about Canada Post? If Canada Post cared what any of us had to say they may have attempted to improve things; however, the same as their strikes I think the organization is using COVID as a reminder that they should have been left to die a long time ago rather than Canadians paying for their service. Canadians could say whatever they want and their service will continue to be exasperatingly horrible."
Pretty hard to pay your bills when they dont come in on time...thats on top of late cheques...and deliveries.....wow....sad.
Terrible customer service. I literally cannot get hold of a real person for about an hour now. My parcel has not moved for over ten days in Ottawa and apparently they don‚Äôt have really humans working for them to discuss these things with.
"hii canada post.. i would like to thx nd greet hard work of cp staff who take things more personally that mistakenly wrong area zip code was written by me on my medicine package 989224 got me 3day delay, the post staff who not only corrected the thing by personal chekng address but delivered @right place. salute u cp. Dr.sandeep kumar"
"Package picked up from sender on May 5, 2020. Expected delivery by May 12 at 4:00 pm. This is already a full 7 days to move a very small package from Vancouver. to Montreal. But still, I have not yet. received my package and the last entry on their tracking portal is that the item was processed on May 7, 2020 at 7:00 am in Calgary and is in transit. If Terry Fox were still alive, I would have received my package by now! No wonder Canada Post is going out of business; they are staffed by the most inefficient and lazy people (very good union protects them); and Canada Post rates are outrageously expensive. Even the USPS, not known for their prompt service, is way more efficient than Canada Post."
"The worst mail service in the world. Yes,It's true!
I already surveyed it, comparing to the other mail service and another country in this same condition and situation. As a result, only Canada Post ranked on top giving the terrible service during this pandemic.
Above all, people complainig about tracking system and customer service.
No update and never get the phone.
So what! This is a pandemic!
I don't care and I'm not listening! You doing this to customer with that attitude. NOW Canada post you represent Canada's future.
If canada company doing like canada post as they never think about crisis and never prepared any disaster.
If you doing at a ross whenever something terrible happend maybe someday you will dissappear.
Canada economic will be get worse.
Comparing to Korea, korea government respond promtly to
covid 19 because korean usually impatient . Korea mail service also really fast and update frequently and kind customer service in this time. And it took just 4days mailing from canada to korea with same price.
Some
day korea or china will be better country if you not learn from that.
I will always pray for canada.
Plez canada post change your arrogant mind and send my letter.
It's for over a month."
"It's been terrible (less than 1 star) for over ten years. It's to a point where I say I'll vote for the next politician that shuts them down. You strike all the time, your employees make way more than most of us and you always think you're being treated unfairly.

You've lost countless packages, anything smaller than a shoe box you can forget about receiving. I once paid $40 for overnight express (on Thursday) that was guaranteed to arrive Friday morning by the clerk. I get a call the following Tuesday morning saying they haven't received my shipment so they're giving the opportunity to another designer (a once in a lifetime opportunity!). The tracking said it was only shipped on Monday evening at 5pm. The clerk didn't have a damn thing to say to me.

Now during COVID the only way I can order basics is from Amazon, their boxes are arriving within days even Sunday night. One retailer used CP instead of UPS, it's been sitting in limbo in Mississauga (3 hours away) since the beginning of May long past its expected delivery date.

The US has so many cheap options that most of the time they just offer clients free shipping... there's absolutely no reason Canada can't have mail competition as well.

If you can't handle all the work maybe you need to hire new full time employees. Dig into those deep pockets of yours and smarten up."
I think Canada Post is closed until further notice. No heads up but I‚Äôm just going to put it out there....
"I sent a parcel; 8 days later it is still ""accepted at (local post office)"". It has not moved. Try to phone: you will be told: ""we are experiencing an unexpectedly high volume of calls"". Next day the same, next week, the same. How can you find something ""unexpected"" if it happens every day? Open a ""service ticket"", great, but no-one has contacted me to say where the parcel is. Really bad service."
"Horrible customer service. Pay for express. Get snail mail. No updates. No way to inquire about packages. Totally disconnected from reality and their customers. If you have any other option, use it. Don‚Äôt use Canada post if you can avoid them."
"0 star rating. I always prefer paying for ANY other shipper. Canada post is by FAR the worst shipping company i have even dealt with. Funny how UPS, FedEx, Canpar, Intelcom and even Puro (branch of canada post) all run with MINIMAL delays during the covid situation but canada post is WEEKS behind, with 0 movement for days and days! Expedited parcel? Ya right! Privatize or close canada post NOW!"
"I am expecting a package handled by Canada Post. The tracking info showed the package has left Mississauga on May 10, and heading to Vancouver, BC. It's almost May 17 now, and the tracking info still says in transit. It's toooooo slow !"
"They‚Äôre absolute garbage. If I could zero stars I would. They don‚Äôt scan their packages, no updates, they don‚Äôt deliver on time, their website is trash. They deserve to go bankrupt, I hope all retailers decide to abandon using them. There are so many packages being held at warehouses, not moving an inch. My package is being held in a warehouse, no scanning, no nothing and it has been almost one week since the expected delivery date. If you cannot do your job then don‚Äôt give people an expected delivery date. If you can‚Äôt deliver on time then don‚Äôt accept orders and let another delivery service take over. Canada Post is absolutely despicable and I hope everyone who suffered at their hands remembers what they‚Äôve done. We shouldn‚Äôt have to put up and pay taxes for a service that can‚Äôt even do the bare minimum."
I ordered two separate packages and Canada Post said they delivered them to my address. The address is correct for the shipping information I provided and they did not deliver them to me. Not sure who has them but it‚Äôs upsetting that they made this mistake twice in 24 hours. I hope the people delivering the mail LOOK at the address and READ it in the future so this doesn‚Äôt continuously happen. I want my packages !
"Dont even bother paying for Xpress shipping, i ordered my package on the 13th was supposed to be delivered yesturday the 15th an who knows where it is because its not here, top it off its saturday now an i have to wait till monday, why do xpress shipping if you cant garuntee you will be on time the time this company stated"
"The worst delivery company on the planet earth. Received 6 shipments off Amazon from private carriers within standard times during COVID. Took 14 days to get something that was picked up from a 4hr drive away from my home.

Canada Post is the laughing stock during the Amazon era of logistics. Never ever use this complete garbage incompetence filled organization. A burning pile of hot garbage."
I was currently working on the Dieppe Canada Post Office and witnessed gentleman worker deliberately mistreating packages and slamming them in the ground like they were garbage. When I was watching this I also filmed it with my phone these people are getting paid extremely high wages to deliberately wreck our Parcels that Take 5 extra days to show up. It has kind of upset me and I imagine a lot of other people too. If I showed up to work and deliberately mistreated my material people would die. What happens if that package was someone's life-saving medicine that this guy just destroyed. This is unacceptable and things need to change
If I could give no stars i would worst company in Canada /world
"No method to their ""sorting"" methods. I know it's covid and all but why do I receive packages from different sources (all through mail) at all different times?
Right now I'm waiting for a package and it's been ""arrived"" in Winnipeg for three days with no delivery and other packages at the same time sail through and are delivered. Completely unacceptable."
Worst above the worst. Use other shipping company save your money and time
"I sent a package in May 2019 (it's now May 2020) from the US to BC. The parcel was received in customs on June 4 and sent out for delivery (I've verified this with CBSA). Canada Post's app has said it will be delivered in 3 to 7 days ever since. I have gotten very little help in trying to locate the parcel, and their app is quite cumbersome and not very user friendly. When I finally reached a real person to talk to, they said I have to file an inquiry with USPS, but USPS will not file a claim because too much time has passed. Unacceptable!"
"Absolutely shameful service. There is no excuse that our packages and mail shouldn‚Äôt arrive in a somewhat timely manner, despite the ‚Äúoverwhelming volumes that are similar to Christmastime‚Äù. If the other carrier services can do their jobs properly during the pandemic, then so should you. I put in a complaint with your customer service department a few weeks ago about my local carrier, and it‚Äôs the same shoddy ‚Äúservice‚Äù all this time later. Wake up and listen to the people of your country because it certainly doesn‚Äôt feel that way at all, when 94% of Canadians posting on this site, are dissatisfied with what little service you do provide us with."
Very expensive and why? There is no service. I paid $200 to have a package sent and I get zero updates. Nothing. I have no idea where my package is. No clue when it will arrive. They just say it's on the way. Really? I knew it was on the way! I'd like to know what state it's in. That would be nice. Any information would be nice. Day after day and no updates. Waiting. Waiting. Is it being delivered by donkey?
"Unfortunately zero stars is not an option so I'll give one.
My reasons: in two different case my order of silver coins and then silver bars supposed to be brought to nearby canada post office.
Somehow both times they marked it as delivered (in my mail box?!).
Investigation was started - nobody ever did anything about it. Every further attempt to contact them ended up in hour long waiting line.
So i guess stealing someone's property is ok these days. As long you are working in any type of government (funded) agency.."
"I ordered a package that contains a spray that calms down my skin irritations just to have it sit in ‚Äúpicked up by Canada post‚Äù sense may 5th. I get there is a state of emergency but if a package can get to me from BC to Ontario within 3 days from amazon, Canada post should be able to get my package from Mississauga to London within the same time. It‚Äôs now been 2 weeks. And nothing has changed. Completely unprofessional and just plain lazy. And there customer service is terrible. Spend the extra few dollars and use fedex or ups cause Canada post will leave you hanging and have IMPORTANT items sitting around for weeks. Just as stupid my sisters beauty products got to her from the states delivered by Canada post in 2 days with regular shipping (5-7 businesses days) she ordered on the 10th ...so I guess Canada post things make up is more important. Ridiculous..."
"Has Canada Post gone on strike again? Of all the people, companies, organizations, and professionals that have stepped up, Canada Post is not one of them. Sometimes unions are good and sometimes they are bad. Canada Post is a prime example of Pussy employees hiding behind their union so they can do as little as possible. Let‚Äôs privatize and rid ourselves of this socialist organization"
Terrible service and lazy
"If you want your package to be delivered next year or being lost in transit then I would give 5 stars to Canada Post. If you want your package to be delivered quickly and in a professional way then it is 1 star. Customer service is very bad too. I will never use them again, never."
In my opinion this is the worst and most cry baby service I have ever seen. 2 day packages now takes a week .
I order items from Amazon.ca it takes one maybe two days to receive item. Covid 19 never stopped Amazon.ca from delivering on time. Canada post very unprofessional their employees are rude and obnoxious. I cannot believe an item mailed Monday and updates on Thursday. I opened a service ticket yesterday no response. No email updates either. I don't know where the item is. I paid expreespost for the item too. Canada post needs more competition.
Canada Post is the absolute WORST company ever! Is there a way to get your items shipped thru somebody else? Honestly the worst postal company ever. When ever I order a item it ships really quick on the part of what ever company I buy it from but once it gets into Canada posts hands I'm hopeless. Literally get a notification from Canada Post that my item is in Mississauga LITERALLY AN HOUR AWAY FROM WHERE I LIVE and I finally get it LITERALLY 3 weeks later.. and this is consistent with Canada Post. Than I order an item from Amazon comes in like 3 days. Absolutely disgraceful like what are these people doing? Taking a tour around the country before they deliver my package? Lol what a joke Canada Post is.
They never fail to disappoint. I bet Canada Post employees use UPS
"After ready all the included reviews I cannot find words to explain that Canada Post tracking and delivery is 100 times worse then all of these comments combined . Is there a 0 star available I ate to think that i have to give !!!!!!
To worse is to know Canada post does not care about our comments"
"well our post woman lets the complex caretaker look through all the mail before it goes into our boxes, she hands parcels and packages out to her favourate residents without checking ID. She is rude, uneducated,a liar.
she all in all is a horrible person and is not fit to deliver any ones private mail.
she represents everything bad about canada post."
Canada Post is the very worst courier company in Canada & maybe the entire world. They are almost NEVER on time and often lose packages. The only reason they are even in business is because our incompetent government pays them whether they work or not. They are a complete disgrace!!
Package took 3 months to reach Ontario from alberta. Got to my city.sat there for another two week before they delivered it. I know the whole Covid virus is effecting everyone but this is just laziness. If they didnt have Canada in their name they would be out of business for their trash service
"I don`t even know where to begin.....
Not sure what year it is over at Canada Post.
We`re paying 2020 prices for 1975 service.
Tracking system is completely useless, but we pay top dollar for it.
They were pathetic before the virus, and now......speechless.
Please remove ""Canada"" from your title, you`re embarrassing us.
Unbelievable."
"Canada Post is an absolute joke, waiting 3 weeks for a package from Hawkesbury Ontario to Newfoundland, and 3 months for a few packages from overseas. Totally unacceptable, they say it's because of the pandemic, that's bull because I haven't had any issues with UPS or Fed Ex. And the Canada Post facility in Mirimichi is the biggest joke of them all, 3 days for a package to get there and clear customs from the bowels of the United States and then 2 weeks from New Brunswick to Newfoundland....What are you doing?!?!?!?"
I am absolutely disgusted by Canada Post right now I understand the covid 19 issues but to wait a month for a package that is being shipped from Mississauga to Ottawa Valley is ridiculous. You finally get an update that a notice has been left to go over to the post office and get nothing but absolute attitude from the postal worker. I will only be ordering from stores using Purolator or Fed ex from now on. Next time you want to strike and want support from the community you won't have mine.
"Horrible service. I was in need of a part for a machine and the supplier I had to get it from only uses Canada Post. I paid the extra to have it rushed ""1-3 business days"". It took 13 days to get it. IF YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE THE RUSH DELIVERIES DON'T OFFER IT! I WANT MY FKN MONEY BACK! I think they all should just drive their little delivery vans into the first road barrier they see, at least then they would have a valid excuse to not deliver on time."
"I have been waiting 15 days for a parcel that shipped via Canada Post. It was picked up on May 1st in Mississauga but not processed until May 3rd Mississauga. It sat there until May 12. Then was picked up Mississauga May 12th to an in route status.. It has now been in route to Newmarket (25k) for 3 days and its still not out for delivery. It was a mothers day gift, At this rate I can use it for a Christmas gift. I recommend to just use curbside pickup or another service. Canada post is using this Pandemic as an excuse to give really really poor service. Its a good thing our other essential workers are doing a much better job.."
Absolutely terrible service. During this pandemic they are the one company that is doing terrible. People that use them have to really change their shipping company. TERRIBLE
"The worst company ever do not trust Canada post, they steal our packages and cover it up by saying your package got lost sorry"
"Absolutely peed off with this shower, recently sent four items on separate occasions to the UK which is in lockdown and they were all delivered within eight days, I have been waiting since the end of March for a bunch of items all separate and have seen one, I cannot track any of them because this pathetic bunch of losers do not even scan the numbers, two years ago the Royal Mail downgraded Canada post to the same level the Italian post and several suppliers in the UK will only ship here now by insured post, what a bunch of losers they must be so proud of themselves, what a laughing stock.Customer service is a disgrace, do these people have no pride in themselves?"
I would give them negative stars if that was an option. My biggest problem with Canada Post is they do not scan packages with tracking numbers on them. I mean how hard is it to scan the packages? SCAN THE PACKAGES!!!!!
"Parcel cost 75 dollars to ship expected delivery date was april 29th. I live in vancouver BC, need I say more about this package warehouse dumping manure show we have of a socialism mail system. My business is finished without this item no covid needed just canada post.
May 12 6:38 am Item processed,Mississauga, ON
May 11 7:38 pm Item processed,Mississauga, ON
May 4 12:36 pm Item processed,Stoney Creek, ON
Apr. 24 4:26 pm Item was released by Customs and is now with Canada Post for processing Mississauga, ON"
Canada Post Sucks - 4 days to get something from Toronto to Mississauga. 3 days being process in Mississauga. Why do they not just shut down and let couriers who have an efficient process with a proper tracking system do it. Amazon ships from Toronto and arrives within hours.
"Amazon is gradually starting to abandon Canada Post and it's excellent because Canada Post has terrible service. They do not respect the delivery times mentioned on their site, they are totally lost, it is a risk of sending a package by Canada Post. Recently my package made a round trip, from the sender to my rental and then returned to the city of the sender to return and be delivered an additional week to what was expected. And it's continually like that because they are lost. Please hire people who can read and valiant!"
"Most people say this service sucks, but not really. It could be like other countries and take forever but it doesn't"
"I was told from Canada Post's promotional video that they are working very hard to deliver mails and parcels during COVID -19 outbreak.
However, their delivery service seems to be very poor and unreliable.
They have delayed delivery three times, and again, they made an error sorting my parcel. Customer service does not know where the parcel is, and they are keeping repeat ""sorry for the inconvenience. I am not sure if I can receive my parcel in a week. Otherwise, Purolators, Fedex, UPS have delivered parcels on time. They are very punctual and reliable. I am pretty sure, these couriers are very busy as much as Canada Post is busy."
"**NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHAT SO EVER**
My delivery was made on April 29th and expected by May 6th, my shipment was picked up by Canada post on May 4th in Mississauga, ON. My shipment has not moved or made any progress since then ( 9 days) , its been 7 days since my expected delivery time passed and it still says my expected delivery time is Wednesday, May 6th. ( 7 days ago)"
"Terrible service and support. In the tracking, it says the package was delivered but no sign of the package anywhere. I am trying to reach customer support to understand where is the package and they are not answering"
"Worst customer service EVER!!!! Covid or no Covid Canada Post couldn't care less about their customers and why should they when they are a government funded corporation? I paid for an expedited parcel to be delivered a week ago from the same city I live in and they can't even show on their tracking site that the package has even been received let alone give an estimated delivery date. What's the point of paying for an expedited service when the service is as slow and unreliable as their regular service?

Earl H."
I ONLY GAVE THEM ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING THE ONLY THING CANADA POST IS GOOD FOR IS GOING ON STRIKE FOR FEELING OVER WORKED.... HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I HEARD PEOPLE SAY MY GOD IF I WAS LUCKEY ENUFF TO HAVE THERE PAY ID GAPPY STILL DELIVER MAIL DOOR TO DOOR STILL LEG ALONE A COMUNITY MAIL BOX PER STREET
Never trust the delivery date mentioned as the guaranteed date because guarantees don't matter to them and likely to show up at least a week after that.
"Is possible to put 0 stars?
Almost two months waiting for a pack. No update, they don't know anything about my pack."
"If this went into the negative, that would be my rating for Canada Post. They are absolutely horrible. And yes, I realize it is a pandemic, but they have always been substandard. They've lost my mail then tried to blame it on the fact that 'those little packages cause a lot of problems in our system'. Well, they're properly labeled if you take the time to read them. I've had people from neighbouring communities show up on my doorstep to give me my mail that was delivered to them instead -and this has happened a lot. Now they are sending my parcels, which arrived in Halifax (I live in Nova Scotia), to Winnipeg to sit in a warehouse. Pathetic, abysmal, incompetent and unreliable -and even worse than that!"
"Canada Post either needs to get with the times, or shut its doors permanently. During this time of social distancing, I tried to sign up for mail forwarding using their website. Imagine my surprise when the site would not accept my debit card - something that almost every other site can do. I have used my debit card for shopping on countless websites without issue. So I phoned customer service for assistance. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes, the service rep gave me a number for Technical Help and assured me the wait time would be minimal. I had to wait another 25 minutes to speak to someone, who was very abrupt and dismissed my concerns. ""We don't accept debit cards."" Really?? No kidding. How about you suggest that you will speak to your management and work on correcting that oversight, instead of a being so curt and unhelpful, especially after a customer has been waiting for nearly an hour to get this resolved.

And the whole time i was on hold, I had to listen to automated messages spouting about efforts to reduce contact and promote social distancing. Hey Canada Post, how about you update your payment options so I don't have to take 2 buses to get to a postal outlet to set up mail forwarding that would normally only take 2-5 minutes on line to complete?

It's true what everyone says: Canada Post is archaic and needs to go by way of the dodo."
A small envelope with 6 seed packages. 2 weeks since it was mailed Winnipeg to Edmonton and still not here. HORRIBLE service! 0 stars
"Beware Best Buy uses Canada Post for deliveries, you will not find this out until after your purchase has been made. There is no option for expedited service, or using another courier. I have been waiting 2 weeks thus far, with no further information from Canada Post then the day Best Buy released the item. As it stands right now, Best Buy doesn't know when the item will arrive, Canada Post has no clue, and I obviously have no clue. Canada Post sucks on the best of days, let alone during times like this. I urge those thinking about buying/ordering threw Best Buy right now to stay away from there online shopping, that is unless you don't mind your package showing up in 2022."
"Heartfelt gratitude to Anthony and all essential services for your selflessness and hard work. Anthony has been delivering to 3050 Pharmacy for years and is the most efficient, presentable, dedicated, polite postal worker. He represents Canada Post with pride and should be recognized for his exceptional work ethics.

I speak for all the tenants at 3050 Pharmacy Ave. We are fortunate to have the best !!!!!!"
"Canada post is a horrific incompetent organization. The federal government should be ashamed of themselves. If this was a private organization they would have went bankrupt long ago. Worst delivery service in the county hands down regardless of the fact that we are in a global pandemic.

0 stars !!!"
"Wish I could give 0 stars but it won‚Äôt let me. Doesn‚Äôt seem to matter where I live they still do a terrible job. As soon as they pick up a package they mark it as notice left, hours before they drop the notice off. I live in a rural area and have to drive to check my mail. Extremely inconvenient and annoying that they do this. I end up wasting my day trying to get my package. They also only deliver our mail about every 2 weeks in the winter. Completely ridiculous. I‚Äôve dealt with almost every parcel delivery service and Canada post is hands down the worst ever."
"There bad ,really bad, unbelievably bad, and than there‚Äôs Canada Post! Wow! There notification system must have been developed by the Trump organization as it only does one thing ( LIES) . It tells you it‚Äôs being delivered 3 days ago (lol), now that‚Äôs magic. Try calling to get help and on hold for 52 minutes. Staff have no answers and have no idea when it will be delivered . I could only give then 1 star as that‚Äôs as low as it would let me. I will be shipping UPS when ever possible."
Been waiting for a package sitting in same location since April 27.. expected delivery April 29. It is now May 12
"Ordered a set of guitar strings shipping out of Pickering ON, shipping to Calgary AB on April 13th. Canada post didn‚Äôt send it out to Calgary until April 23rd. It arrived in Calgary on the 27th and was shipped TO EDMONTON AND BACK TO CALGARY. Expected delivery has been updated 3 times now. Most recent said today ( May 11 ) but guess what? Never came. I understand covid is a factor but there is no excuse to send a package from Calgary to Edmonton back to Calgary. My understanding of where my package is now is sitting in a warehouse collecting dust."
Canada post is a god damn joke. It took almost 3 weeks for my order to be shipped and they said that it will be delivered Monday (today) at the end of the day and it still has not come. Then when I called to see what's going on they hang up on me 3 times after waiting for all most an hour every time I call back.
"By far one of the worst mailing systems on this planet. The customer service cannot tell me anything about the package or a possible location. I'd have more respect for them if they said it was located in the toilet. They directed me to USPS even though the package isn't even in country. Basically, they are trying to shovel up mess and place it into someone else's lawn."
"Been waiting for an item from Ontario since April 27th. It originally said Delivery May 7. When that didn‚Äôt happen it went to Delivery May 8th. Well, it‚Äôs May 11th and still no parcel. I have received two parcels from the USA via FedX that were purchased AFTER the parcel that Canada Post is delivering from Ontario. I will be letting the company I ordered from that I will not deal with them again because of Canada Posts terrible service and pathetic tracking ability. Canada Post really sucks the big one!"
"I have 14 small packs missing and nobody knows where they are.
Two of them shipped from China in the middle of February and the rest is in March.Tracking numbers on the packs are not Canada Post numbers,but easily searchable on Packages24.com.I called and chatted online with Canada Post customer service reps.I provided them the tracking numbers but their system can't tell nothing about packages.They eliminated""on time delivery rule"" from their service and I was told that packs will be delivered they don't know when..
Also the rep mentioned that looks like the packs were not scanned to get into their system even though some show they were released from customs in March.Where are the shipments????Lost?Stolen?They say that Canada Post overloaded with parcels as in Christmas time,but if they do not deliver of course they will be overloaded.I see a postman coming to my condo with half full basket,not that busy as they say they are.They just found an excuse with the virus.It will destroy lots on-line businesses.People will ask for refunds because 3-4 months delivery time is not acceptable."
"I've had two packages with fake delivery notifications to my community mailbox. First case happened Friday, May 1st, a key to an empty mailbox was placed in my mailbox. Left a note asking where the package was and Monday May 4th, no key, no note, no package. Today Monday May 11, another delivery notification for a different package, within minutes I went down, no postal worker, no key, no package. I am not going to use Canada Post again. If I order anything online in the future, I will make sure that Canada Post is not used, even if I have to cancel my order. This is fraud. Sad state of affairs when 3rd party delivery drivers are more trust worthy. Do not use Canada Post."
"I honestly understand these are trying times for the Canada Post employees and I understand delivery standards are impossible to keep at the moment. If you want to keep your customers happy... PLEASE START SCANNING PARCELS! I have several parcels without any tracking updates and my customers are getting upset. Brought an item to Post office April 25th, now May 11th, tracking STILL says "" Item accepted at Post Office"" and nothing more.
Another brought over a week ago status says, ""label created, not yet in system""
I brought it to you guys myself and YOU created the label. How can it not be in the system???
PLEASE SCAN ITEMS APPROPRIATELY AND ON TIME!"
My package was sitting at my local Canada Post for two weeks and today it finally says delivered but it says delivered to a city that I don‚Äôt even live in!
"Chat line is impossible to access. No response to on line request for issue resolution. Parcel sitting at Canada Post in Montreal since last month.
They obviously do not care about customer satisfaction."
"Ordered a set of wheels and tires it was supposed to be delivered on May 7th it is now the 11th and I recieved a notification saying an attempt was made to deliver and a note was left. I was outside the entire time waiting for it because tracking said it was ""out for delivery between 09:30 and 13:30. Now I have to figure out a way to get 4 rims and tires to my place that are now located on the other side of the city because the guy didn't want to drop them off, I don't own a truck or suv. Thanks Canada Post you guys are a bunch of lazy dinks why the hell do you go on strike every year."
"I worked at Canada Post for a while when i was younger. I knew them to be professionals,fast and reliable.
They are not and tried it a lot in the past weeks.
You can order from Amazon or anywhere else, Canada Post will be the worst. If you have 3 order made at the same time on Amazon, you will receive everything that Purolator, UPS, Fedex and Canpar before Canada Post even process their tracking number. They have the most employees and vehicules but can't even scan before other company ships it. I received three packages that i ordered days ago, the only one that is not here, again, is the one processed by Canada Post, i wish i could pay to not use them on Amazon, please use another company for Prime.
It's is shame that Canada is in their name."
"Again Canada Post fail their own advised delivery expectations for two parcels this week. It seems UPS, Purolator, Intelcom can all meet or exceed expectations.

Online retailers, Canada Post are bad for your brand."
I detest Canada Post! My mail keeps getting lost and I also receive other people's mail. I already complained twice and all they do is give you a ticket number. It started again and it's so frustrating....I now have to track all my missed mail and probably get charged for replacing the 'lost' items. Horrible service.......
"Ordered monday from Calgary, paid 20$ extra to get fast delivery for mother's day, guess what, delivery will be Monday. Every time my parcel is delivered by Canada Post, it arrives late, but never with UPS, Purolator, Fed Ex and Intelcom."
"Canada Post has always been solid for me. Even in the face of a global Pandemic they have been reliable. Dealing with the issues I have with other companies, namely UPS (ugh!), has made me all that much more grateful to have a great national delivery organization. Thank you to all your essential employees during this time and for the fantastic service!"
"I can appreciate the Covid-19 situation and expect some delays but waiting over one month (and more...still waiting) for a package to go from Mississauga to Toronto is unacceptable. Canada Post needs to be completely up front with the delay so people can decide on another method of delivery, should they choose, and/or they need to stop accepting more packages until they are caught up. If they cannot handle the increase in packages in this environment, stop accepting more packages!!"
"I placed an order coming from China.

It look less time for the package to go from China to the Mississauga plant, than the time it takes to deliver it from Mississauga to Ottawa. How much longer? I don't know yet - It's still sitting at the Mississauga plant, and this for 12 days now.

And so let's hide behind COVID, Canada Post. Heck, why not let the package lie there for 6 months - reason, COVID....

You guys found the perfect reason not to work."
"Wish I could give it a zero. Such terrible service and their online tracking is so fake. I unfortunately had to use CP for 2 separate packages I ordered. 1 order took over 4 weeks to come in. It was a birthday gift. It arrived late so I couldn't even give it to them on their birthday and the other never even arrived. Mind you the one that was delivered, the online tracking never updated. It still says ""shipping label created"". I understand the pandemic but its so ridiculous. If these two places allowed curbside pick up I for sure would have just drove. The one item is in missisauga( I live in etobicoke) and the other is in Toronto. I don't even bother calling. Its such a waste of time."
"I do appreciate the Scale of the operation that Canada Post has to deal with now. What I don't get is just how there's no philosophy for making things work a little more fluidly. Dispatch and management of items is non-existent.
10 days to Ship a Letter within the SAME City. I could have walked there in 20min.
Stamps, ordered from their Online Store still haven't arrived, Ordered on April 4th. Ticket Opened, and a Tracking Number was given. Still hasn't arrived.

4-5 items coming from the USA in to Canada Posts hands. All have taken unreasonable amount of time (1.5 months or more), and are yet to arrive in Canada, even though USPS shows that the item was transferred.

Does everything need to go through Customs? No longer using, with the exception of Stamp Mail. Only use for items within Canada, and that's still a little risky."
"My package had the label created April 21, not picked up until April 28, supposed to arrive April 30, knew it never would. Finally arrived in Montreal May 3, and that's where it sits. I've had other parcels stop in Montreal and never receive them, one was a mini split heat pump. How in the hell do they lose a heat pump, they don't, someone steals it. I open a ticket, get the typical reply, we're trying our best crap, if Canada Post was privatized, workers might work. Instead of working 4 hour days and getting paid for 8. I would chose a different delivery method, but it wasn't available. I will not order from anyone that uses Canada Post from now on. THEY SUCK!!! useless as tits on a bull!"
I really appreciate the Canada Post employees for delivering my parcel on time inspite of all these Covid 19 problems...You really deserve a five star. Thanks
"most pathetic postal service in North America, no customer service support what so ever. I wish you guys never existed."
"SLOW SLOW SLOW
Tracking does not get updated!!! Horrible delivery time. Why businesses use this service is beyond me."
On the Canada post website it says estimated delivery was on may 6 that was 2 days ago
"I ordered a package from Lethbridge Alberta, it was coming to Calgary Alberta. It didn't show up yesterday when it was supposed to so today I tacked it ... my package is in Winnipeg. There is no reason it should be there it never should have left Alberta."
"An expedited parcel that is typically 3-5 day shipping should never take more than a month. Even with the high volume, other shipping companies are able to handle it. Some delays are obviously expected, but Canada Post has fallen apart.
Update two weeks later, parcel is now missing. Canada post estimates another 10 days to locate. Shipping time will soon be over two months from Ontario to Alberta."
"If I could give a negative rating, I would. Either my packages take a eternity to arrive (later than the expected date) or when by miracle they are in the delivery truck the expected day, the drivers leaves a notice at my door saying I have to pick-up the package at a pick-up location. Of course they do not knock because I guess that would be too much of an effort. Their new ""Choose an alternative delivery method"" option allows you to tell them what to do with your package if you are not home (example: leave it at the front door) but what do you know? It doesn't change anything and they still only leave the notice. It is terribly insulting to think that this company is government owned. On top of all that, the employees are always on strike so there is very little service during those times. Last time I called to have info on an urgent packet that was not delivered, I waited 1h19 minutes before having any kind of assistance. Now to be fair, it was during the Covid-19 lockdown so I know they had a lot of calls and maybe reduce personel but still. The guy that answered was very nice and understanding, but of course he couldn't do anything except opening a ticket.... which of course didn't change anything to the situation."
"Understand delay due to Covid, but they are just very disorganized and making careless mistakes, losing items and delivering to completely different cities and addresses. I have received numerous other orders from Amazon logistics, FedEx and UPS with little to no issue or delay as well if there is a delay the tracking is updated. Not the case with Canada Post."
"I sent out 2 oversize letters over 10 days ago to Whitby and Toronto just from Brampton

Both recipients have not received them....They were Covid 19 masks for my
loved ones.

I am disgusted with Canada Posts totally inadequate service!!!!!

If you are overwhelmed..I talked to a postal worker yesterday in Brampton then for gods sake hire more people!

A friend sent an envelope to Leamington from Shelburne and his mother got it in 3 days...yet my stuff which is only local takes over 10 days??

I wouldn't be surprised if the masks were opened by a postal worker and ripped off when they saw what was there...very expensive masks.

I am really really disappointed in the lack of service..most likely my loved ones will never see the masks."
Complete garbage. When the going gets tough Canada Post disappears. Garbage service.
They still sell express delivery (1 day) during Covid 19 but can‚Äôt guarantee it. Been a week now and still waiting. They shouldn‚Äôt offer the more expensive options if they can‚Äôt do it. Will use another delivery service from now on.
"Call us back by this date.call them again, call back in another ten days...so far 25 days and no movement.stuck in Stoney Creek parcel purgatory.....,"
"I know we are in COVID right now, but their tracking sucks compared to EVERY, and I mean EVERY other carrier. I have had many, Purolator, Fedex, UPS, locally INtelcom, and all are pretty exact. It's almost 9 pm and tracking says still arriving today. Understandable that packages are delayed, but why can they not provide any sort of decent tracking. Canada Post is a joke...COVID or no COVID. They pale in comparison to others. Oh, and how many times they put the delivery notice in my mail box because too lazy to bring to my door, in turn, making me drive to the local post office, far out of my way, to retrieve a package that was supposed to come to my door. Sorry, is it clear that I have serious frustration with this poor excuse of a delivery service? I hope so...."
"might as well use a homing pigeon, thee worst parcel delivery service!"
"Canada post is so TRASH They take forever, their updates are inaccurate. I stand By Puro Or DHL."
Hands down the worst postal system in the developed western world.
I give this company a 1 because there are awful at shipping! Would not recommend it to anyone who actually wants what they are gettin shipped! What a f***ng joke Canada post is! Will never get anything from them again!
"If I could give you zero, you can bet your life I would! You tried blaming another company for an error which, in fact, was yours. You must of forgot the email you sent apologizing for ‚Äúyour‚Äù error. Not to mention the tracking information shows that it was in my area and was then rerouted to a province across the country; but sure, Canada Post, sure it was the senders fault. Have some dignity and take responsibility. No accountability what so ever. I wish we had a say in where our parcels were sent for further processing and delivery. By the way, you actually suck!"
I paid 20$ dollars for shipping that was supposed to arrive on May 4th. It‚Äôs May 6th and the last update I got was from April 30th. Still haven‚Äôt received my package and I can‚Äôt get in touch with anyone because their customer service is awful. I called three times and tried to navigate the site for an hour. F*** Canada Post!
"My order been sitting in the warehouse or maybe lost!!! But when I message the seller (amazon) they said it wasnt lost, its just delayed and wait for another 1-10 days !!!please amazon.ca stay away from Canada Post they will ruin your business."
"Worst Service ever. They lost so many packages! The customer service is horrible. When you call, you wait for 30 minutes and then the line cuts so you need to start the process all over again. Horrible."
"Canada Post sucks! Express package going from Mississauga to London Ontario sent April 30. Expected delivery Monday May 4, here we are May 6 and it‚Äôs still in transit! No update, no response from Service Ticket. Why are we funding this inept corporation? Clearly CPC ought to get advice from Purolator or FedEx who are getting the job done despite the current situation. I will NEVER ship with Canada Post again."
"I have been expecting a package that was to be delivered over a week ago according to the tracking number. They had suspended mail to this building but it resumed a few days ago, I was assured I would get the package. Other mail was delivered I still haven't got the package.
I feel like I poured good money down the drain. Even if this incompetent outfit delivers, I will NEVER use their service again."
"Imagine requesting mailbox keys, being given 3 day wait--- waiting 6 days--- attempting to call the support number in the email sent to you and it being disconnected---- calling and being on hold for 30 minutes to get a guy in a rush to give me the WRONG tracking number which i SHOULD have been given in the first email about ordering my keys but it doesnt matter cause the code was WRONGGGGGGGGGGG. calling every day and getting conflicting information on how to go about getting my mail box keys all while the locks have been changed and I have no way to god **** access my god **** mailbox. Imagine all this while you have a cheque in the mail with money you rely on to survive. HOLY **** dont @ me with this ****"
This company is a joke we need to stop funding them
Maybe do less time honking at hospitals do your damn job ...i understand you wanna show your support but all of us have paid for your service which is sh$t ...we r the ones who keeping you open...be nice and respectful and deliver the items we all bought with the little money we have right now....
They've managed to lose my parcel and do absolutely nothing about it for over 3 weeks
"Package shipped and landed about 1 hours away last week.
I called Canada Post to try to find out why the item has been sitting idle for 3-4 business days.

The Canada Post employee on the phone was very shietty with me, and made me feel like I was wasting her time asking these questions.
They were not able to help me, and told me that I would have to just wait until the end of the week, and call back if nothing has happened.
Note: this will make the Delivery 9 days on a Xpress delivery that was supposed to be at final destination within 2 days.

CANADA POST - Does not honor, or live up to there own Xpresspost shipping promises.
Do not waste money with Canada Post shipping xpresspost, they take that money and pocket it, and ship standard post anyways.

Conclusion: Canada Post is very poorly run, and does not live up to their promises."
A truly terribly run organization from top to bottom. This government entity needs to be competent revamped. Whatever they are doing is not working. The only thing that keeps them in business is junk mail and government funding. When it comes to delivering packages you have a better chance of having a blind monkey delivering your products on time.
Yet again Canada Post lets us know what their true values and services. As normal they're still charging everybody for Express and guaranteed deliveries with their stated transparency of with covid-19 not be delivered on time. And yet not offering any refunds or taking off any of the charges that they offered for those services to get the stuff on time. Worst ever if there was any way I could mail through a company without it I would am requesting all the companies I deal with to go through UPS or FedEx Canada Post what a let-down
"It‚Äôs unfortunate that you have to even give a star, Canada post is not worth even 1, parcel left Edmonton April 8th arrival April 16th... no and no updates, arrival May 1st.... no and no updates. May 5th, still no package and no updates. This package is supplies to my business, which is only successful if I‚Äôm prepared during spring. Which I will not be now!! They get to decide what is priority and what is not, how god-like?!?!?! I remember the signs save door to door, what a mistake get rid of them!!! If you have ever used USPS you know how organized quick and efficient they are, so it can be done!! Canada post is a joke! Use any other carrier if you want parcels delivered and go paperless for everything else! And force them to take Canada out of their name, they are giving us a bad rap!!! Rename, Maybe post, or Sometimes post, or Don‚Äôt count on us post!!"
"They are arguably the worst courier service on the planet.

I try not to use them when ever I can because they never do what they're supposed to do. Most of the time when they see our house, they're intimidated by the stairs and will put 'attempted delivery no one home' mean while there are a minimum of 4 vehicles at the house with people here constantly. They're customer service is garbage. When ever I try to get any information they essentially give me a professional version of 'I don't know' and their most recent issue, I ordered a package, it was sent by a seller in Canada, Canada post has received it, and hasn't touched it in two weeks, and when ever I ask why it hasn't been touched they never can give me an answer. I wish I could tell what stores used them so I could ask for a different courier, they shouldn't be in business. F*** CANADA POST"
This is the most worthless organization in the world. They NEVER deliver packages. They lie. They lose packages ALL the time. They need to be shut down.
"I have been waiting for a package which was originally scheduled to arrive on April 21st - it is now May 4th and I am yet to receive it. I find it absolutely unacceptable for an expedited parcel to be this delayed, especially considering that it is in no way heavy or hard to deliver. Additionally, the tracker rarely updates. The few times it does, it shows that there are preposterous delays between things as small as picking up a package and processing it. In my case it took 11 days (that's 5 days more than the entire delivery should have taken)! I don't know whether it's bad management or the package got lost somewhere. All I know is that this is absolutely unacceptable, even when considering social-distancing measures. Fix your stuff Canada Post."
"Canada post
Would NEVER EVER EVER be a choice for me
I AVOID companies that deliver with them if I notice they do
The delivery workers are completely RIDICULOUS
It is like they do not know how to make deliveries even with GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS

CANADA POST NEED TO HIRE BETTER DELIVERY WORKERS
Other companies are WAYYY BETTER THAN CANADA POST
I do not even see why any company would purposely choose Canada post
WORSE DELIVERY WORKERS EVER"
What a joke. If only this service could not get government funding and just go out of business so this service carrier would never be a shipping option.
amazon shipped my package april 24th. the origin location of that package is ville st-laurent and it took 12 days to deliver a package that was 14km from my house before i bought it. this is not the first time i experience stuff like this with canada post and i definitely feel like they are taking avantage of the current corona virus situation to excuse their already bad service
"I understand CP has increased volumes during the pandemic, their site states up to 30 day delays. This is extreme.
So why are they not delivering on weekends??? Ridiculous.
I'm sorry but CP complained that volumes for letter mail were down and they were experiencing losses. Then the online shopping increased and they couldn't handle it. Even without the pandemic the service was lousy. Their system is archaic.
Also, Why is their system never updated ? It's like a big black hole. Calling CP does nothing. The virtual assistant is useless.
CP is expensive but the service doesn't equate."
"I am confused about these dates. I expect the package in Montreal. Supposedly it was in Montreal on the 26th when it actually shipped from Mississaugua on the 27th and expected delivery on the 28th of April. Now after a week of no updates, it is in St Johns NL???
May 2 1:10 pm Item processed St Johns, NL
Apr. 26 4:27 pm Item processed Montreal, QC
Apr. 27 4:49 pm Shipment received at originating
postal facility Mississauga, ON

I have to join everyone else complaining about their services. Pandemic or no, they have been the worst to deal with, and most of their delivery agents either do not ring/nock on the door or ring once and leave a delivery note right away without even waiting for an answer."
"I usually don't take much issue with CP, they can be slow, but we're used to that. I was used to tracked international items taking 2 weeks to arrive at my door (3 days
max to reach Canada from anywhere); now, it's 6 weeks to never. Do not use Canada Post right now if you can help it. Unless it's an Amazon parcel, which CP always delivers early, even now, you may not see your items until next year, if even then."
"4 months ago I sent a package including an ID and small item about 100 gr to Thailand. I paid $10.82 to post office at 1530 Albion Rd. The package never received by other party. I called customer service it did not work because the service had no tracking number. To get track number, post office asked for 70 dollar ( I refused to pay this) which my item cost only about 10 dollar and ID card that is important as well. If Canada post can not handle the service why they offer such services. Are they force customers indirectly to pay high price for such services by not doing regular service properly? I am very disappointed from their services. Additionally I have to mention that sometime my package never arrive to me from overseas however I do not know who is fault."
"Placed an order from company in Mississauga April 17, 2020
1. Item picked up by Canada Post April 21
2. Item processed Mississauga April 23 - 9:09 pm
3. Item processed Mississauga April 24 - 4:36 pm
4. Item processed Mississauga April 25 - 7:20 am

6. Item processed Oshawa May 1, 8:36 am
7. item out for Delivery Oshawa May 1 10:48 am
8. item re-routed due to processing error May 1 11:31 am

LIKE SERIOUSLY AND NOW ITS THE WEEKEND AGAIN!!!!!!!"
"My package has been sitting at their Mississauga Distribution center for almost two weeks now. The distribution center is 4 minutes from my house. How come NO other postal service is this backup up? I've been receiving my packages from amazon through Purolator ON TIME. I ordered a colouring book the other day and its already here. So how come Canada post is SO incompetent? Absolutely ridiculous. Always on strike for more money yet the most mis-managed postal service to ever exist in north america regardless of the virus.

Not to mention during regular times their drivers are lazy and ruin packages and dont even bother to bring it to my door. Lazy and incompetent."
"I ordered on ebay, April the 27th, the film antichrist. Canada post were the ones to ship it. The estimated delivery time was between the 22nd and 27th of April. I received my package today, may the first. The package was completely destroyed, the case smashed and split in 2. The only mild saving grace was that the bluray disk only has 3 small scrapes in it. Disk seems to run alright. I apparantly cannot file a claim and the gracious seller should not have to be giving me a refund. My package was late and destroyed. I understand that people are stressed and there is currently a global pandemic but that's no excuse to deliver my item in a condition resembling it having been opened with a box cutter and stomped on several times. In no world should the seller be liabal to this abhorrent case of complete disregard for package quality and delivery time."
"Just a mess. I have empathy for those working however when a parcel sits for 6 days 15kms from me and remains undelivered I have to ask why. You can only blame so much on Covid. I watched the news yesterday as approxinately 40 delievry trucks paraded through Mississauga as a salute to essential workers.... nice gesture but....WHO""S delivering the mail?"
"If I could I would have given 0 rating for Canada Post. I send large number of registered mail shipments from Poland. None of them is traceable on Canad Post website. Lots of them is delivered with significant delay. I am talking 6-7 weeks or not delivered at all.
During February-April 2020 I had to refund large number of customer orders whose packages did not show up. When I called customer service they tried to give some vague explanation that my parcel is not traceable on their website because Polish post did not enable this service or something. It is not true because parcel is traceable on Polish website and all other EU countries as well as countries in Asia and South America. I wish I could avoid this carrier at all cost. Very slow and unreliable company hurting every small business operations."
Another one star review cause like everyone else here my package has been sitting in mississauga. Never will I order anything online that uses Canada Post as a service again.....never.
I‚Äôve never had a worse experience with a company. Order my package 3 weeks ago and still hasn‚Äôt come in. Package has been sitting in Mississauga ON for a whole week 20 mins away from where I live. Every time I try to talk to somebody the call convienent you cancels or their online chat person doesn‚Äôt type. I‚Äôve never been more frustrated
"Canada post is awful...said to be delivered by end of day april 15th, it is may 1st..ive contacted them in every way possible and they have no answers. second package set to be delivered by end of day NOW also says in transit days later.

useless"
"Very bad service, I submited a ticket 1 week ago and not reply yet, on the line I wait mire than 1 hour and noone replies"
I paid for the xpresspost and after 2 days expected delivery it is still in transit. W*F. I never had this problem when I usd other couriers. Never ever again. Their fuckibg service is the worst of the worst
great job. even when it gets harder you keep on chugging....
Canada post is garbage the wait times are ridiculous. A package from Stoney creek to Toronto has taken a week. I ordered a small box from Fedex and it came within 2 days from Florida to Toronto
"Unfortunately, I paid the $15.00 postage to have my package delivered (from Surrey - not across the globe!) and the directions specifically stated that if no one was home (signature required) it would be delivered to the closest Postal Outlet. This package is medication I need to deal with the stress of my job, COVID 19 etc. No one (deliverer or recipient) was ""informed that this would NOT happen (I mean, they did accept payment for the service as described). So, I was informed after the fact (when the package was apparently 'delivered' even though I am at work as a health provider and can't get parcels delivered at work because no one without hospital ID is allowed in the building!) that it was actually delivered without signature!! If their service does NOT include what I paid for, then they should not have accepted the payment in the first place. No one informed me of these changes - the ridiculous new policy (Knock-Drop-and-Go), where the stupid delivery guy just left it at my apartment building door (and did not contact me at all that they were there, which would have been a phone call to my partner, whose phone number is connected to our apartment buzzer). No attempt to even TRY to let anyone know they dropped it off. I got a text message that it had been ""delivered"" while I was at work...

I spent one hour waiting on hold to speak to someone about this, and I was berated for wanting to use the service I PAID for (I was not amused, waiting over 50 minutes to be told ?I'm in the wrong for wanting to sign for my package? It is MEDICATION that could potentially be harmful if in the wrong hands. Yes, Canada Post could/should be liable if the person who actually got my package decided to take my medication and DIED! Since this person did not offer any help, I asked to speak to their supervisor.... what a joke. This overpaid goon said and did the same thing - basically laughing at me for trying to get the service I PAID for, and then saying.. You could try the ombudsman"" (but they'll say the same thing I said). Unreal. If I did my job with the same arrogance and lack of empathy, I would not have a job. I do care about people, and would not treat any of the patients I deal with in such a denigrating fashion.

This new policy they put in place (so recently, they did not have a chance to tell the customers about it before accepting payment) just gave their delivery guys a free pass on what they have been doing all this time, just drop the package and leave. I've been telling the companies I order from that I cannot order anything using Canada Post due to their horrible ""service"". I will never buy from any retailer that uses Cnd Post ever again, and I advise others to do the same. Let us pressure retailers to stay away from this terrible company and hopefully it will be shut down!! They use the pandemic to account for their poor service. Should I do the same for people coming in to hospital for help with this virus??? Definitely NOT! I have standards (unlike them). PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM IN FUTURE !!"
"Terrible Service, and they constantly lie about delivery times. I am 0 for 20+ on a package handled by them arriving on time, even when you pay extra for xpresspost it doesn't make a difference. Do yourself a favor and use another carrier if it is an option, often for less money"
If I could post zero stars I would...my god how difficult can it be when your spending millions on a service and paying big wages to your workers...worst site I've ever encountered and cant believe you want your customers to use it instead of going to the post office in person...
Worst post service of the world I've had ever used. Even Indonesia or Mexican post work much better. I stopped shipped my goods to Canada and probably will never ship again.
"Suppose to of arrived tuesday (yesterday) then they're telling me sorry it's an error in the system it take 2 DAYS TO FIX?Explaining they're sorry it will arrive most probably Friday....That's what Express mailing is? Being 5 days for 5 hour distance. TERRIBLE SERVICE - DO SOMETHING CANADA.

No offer of refund, just an OOPS SORRY..

Friends across the world have 100x better service they dont believe the stuff I tell them
Terrible terrible service. I wish they'd just be shut down and subcontract the Express deliveries.... waste of money. Waste of time.

(Why would I care about a system error and how about refunding me my Express shipping to the sender if not me who paid.... total scammers.) Oh Canada, the place your mail wont come......"
"I have (almost) consistently received terrible service with Canada Post for years.

Once (when I was living in an apartment) they delivered an expensive computer part to my neighbours because I wasn't home. They couldn't be bothered to leave a card or drop it outside my door. Thankfully I had honest neighbours. When I called to complain, they did an ""investigation"" and then got back to me to say ""all of our drivers say they didn't do that"".

I once had a driver who got angry because I was having a lot of packages delivered to my house. Hello - that's your job.

One time when I was very ill from a chronic illness, I sent a family member who lived at the same address to pick up a package for me. They had their ID and they had the delivery notice. The Canada Post employee refused to give them the package. I complained and was told that I had to send a letter of authorization...even though Canada Post's policies on their website clearly state that this isn't needed if you live at the same address. So either their workers are completely ignorant of their own policies, or they have ""secret"" policies that they make the public guess at.

Once they lost a package for 6 months......6 months!!! that they had marked as ""delivered"". Because the seller refused to initiate an investigation (and Canada Post won't help you as the buyer...even though you were the one who paid shipping costs), I had to get a refund from my credit card. 6 months later...the package turns up.

They supposedly will ""safe drop"" a package, but every single time they leave it where it's highly visible from the sidewalk or street, even though there's a safer place to drop it right nearby. After they implemented the ""delivery preferences"" option I've been trying to use that (my side door is safer), but every. single. driver. just ignores it."
"I really can't believe some of these people actually got through to canada post on the phone, because whenever I have tried to call them, the recording saus they have a high call volume and can't take the call. This is as soon as they open. Worst website as well."
"Nowhere near as reliable and efficient as UPS, FEDEX, Purolater or Cardinal.
Would never use Canada Post, however some businesses ship items out with them.
They lost one of my items recently.
Most recent item, the expected delivery date was for April 24th, it is April 28th, still in transit, called the support line, they cannot give any other updates.. no whereabouts to where my item is in transit...it was suppose to be delivered 4 days ago!?
The only reason Canada Post still exists is because it is government owned -one of the worst organizations in operation today.
Make sure the company you are buying your product from does not use Canada Post if you are in need of timely and reliable delivery."
"Worst service ever. Union employees with no accountability. Ever tried to find a lost package or file a complaint with them? Good luck finding someone to talk to. Canada Post should always be your last resort, COVID or not. I'd be sympathetic to their delays if their tracking was at least partially accurate and they weren't covering up sorting facility closures. Canada Post is a national embarrassment and a lesson in mismanagement."
The item I ordered had a 5 to 7 days delivery. Even though I understand there‚Äôs corona and the circulation is bad I don‚Äôt think I should‚Äôve waited those 3 weeks
"I have a package that is in transit for over a week and a half. Tracking states it is in transit from a site 10 minutes from my house. Is it really in transit? Or is their tracking information fraudulent? It was promised for Monday, April 20th and I am still waiting on April 28th. This is an important package to assist with a health issue and if I knew Canada Post would not be able to fulfill their requirements, I would not have ordered. I suggest that companies avoid using Canada Post and find a private company to deliver their orders. Unfortunately companies will get a bad reputation only because Canada Post is not doing their job. If Canada Post is so overwhelmed - not sure why?? then they should tell the public and companies that they are not taking new packages. Don't keep taking packages if you can't do the job."
"I have package with 1 business day shipment setup on regular basis. So far I never received the package less than a week. Under the circumstances (the pandemic as they refer to it these days) Purolator and UPS still keep their timeline. Canada post could have a huge potential but in this communist, union regulated country you can not rely on one of the most essential services."
"I understand delays because of the pandemic but this is ridiculous! I have been waiting 3 weeks for 2 local parcels. Their tracking system shows that neither parcel has moved since they received it. These are local parcels, not coming from another country. Now I""m online waiting to speak to customer service - been waiting over half an hour even though the automated message said there was a 10 minute wait. HIRE MORE PEOPLE!!! DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO BUT DELIVER THE PARCELS BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED THEIR STUFF!"
I asked the delivery person to hang on for a min while I put on gloves and masks I opened the door got my head torn off cause he said peoples make him wait and he has no time ... ok well thanks for the horrible ervice !
"Absolutely the worst delivery service ever, most days they dont even come to our apartment building. Mondays lol.. never, must be too busy elsewhere.
Please get your delivery workers on the same page as they are being paid to do a job. And we as customers pay for this useless so called service!
It's got nothing to do with the coronavirus"
"Perpetually late and unapologetic. Yet another poorly run, inefficient, not profitable crown corporation."
They delivered it on time. I have no complaints.
Canada post is rerouting parcels through Quebec. Mine come from the States every month to Mississauga then Winnipeg. This month was sent through Hamilton to Quebec and is now sitting in the worst hit COVID location in Canada. Are they trying to help the spread?!?! Why Quebec and why now?!?!
"Back in October, I had this parcel sent from the UK and it took seven whole weeks to get here. After six months, I finally decided to give Canada Post a chance again. WORST DECISION I‚ÄôVE EVER MADE!! I have this package that was supposed to come on the 16th but it‚Äôs the 26th and it still isn‚Äôt here yet. It is sent from Scarborough to downtown Toronto A 15 MINUTE DRIVE!!! I regret using Canada post every time. The Canada post company needs to work with their system since it‚Äôs so clearly inefficient. Honestly just use fedex or ups, they‚Äôre way more efficient and on time."
"I just had a very poor customer service experience at canada post moneygram at shoppers drug mart lougheed hi-way..i send money through moneygram and when i check its a wrong amount and i need to send again and pay another transfer service and blaming me that i never tell her clearly the amount..it happen to me 2x with that lady , and telling me its my fault and told me next time find other place to send money because she will not provide the service to me anymore"
"I understand delays from covid 19. But the fact that they're focusing on new orders, and letting old orders just sit there, is completely obsurd. I've been waiting for a month with no updates. What I ordered loses freshness over time. So this is very inconvenient."
"The worst mail company that I have received a package through. Every other mail company must have greater resources or faithful workers. Acceptable time delays with a global pandemic but I‚Äôve waited 10 days for a package to go 30 minutes down the street, From where it was sent, only 4 hours away from destination and the only information i received from two workers and a manager was it will arrive sometime in the future and I am not able to go pick up my package from any facility there‚Äôs nothing they could do. I told them to ship it with another company because they can‚Äôt drive 4 hours down the street and I‚Äôm not allowed to pick it up from their facility and the manager hung up on me. Sincerely will never use this company willingly. I apologize to anyone who may work at Canada post and try to live up to some ethics or standards but the company lacks structure with terrible service and seemingly no codes or procedures or policies in place to operate in a timely fashion."
I'd like to thank Canada Post for their ongoing excellent customer service and for making sure that post is being delivered in a timely manner during this time. Thank you!
Well I ordered an item on the 17th of April coming from British Columbia to Alberta...should only take 3 days...while I was checking everyday to where my product was and never change from Maple Ridge BC till this morning 24th Apr. That is expected for delivery in Montreal Quebec...So I called and was told that they will re-address to me here in Alberta so I'll get it late next week...this is medicine for me..and I run out on Sunday...so I called back could not understand the guy that answered so I raised my voice when he said is tuesday could I said NO...hung up gone...so I dont know what's happening and when I will receive.
"I ordered a $600 item from bestbuy on the 10th and it was shipped 1 day later. That item is still ""in transit"" in mississauga and it's the 24th. Expected delivery was the 17th. The thing that really bothers me is that my friends ordered the exact same item on the 17th through bestbuy and canada post aswell and his came in 3 days. Over 2 weeks for national shipping is insane, I've gotten stuff from China faster."
"Canada Post tried to scam, we paid for express post ( 2 day service) it took 7 days, at least he received package. They made him repay on his end even with a copy of receipt hitch I had emailed him. I called Canada Post and the said they would look into the matter and get back to me, because I was the sender. This was on April 16. I finally called them on April 23, and they still had done nothing on this matter. After an hour on hold and being put onto a supervisor, a refund for the extra charge is supposed to be mailed out. I‚Äôm not holding my breath. They said I should receive in 10 days. I will try to never use this horrible service again. I know we should try to use Canadian companies as much as possible, but this experience has been unacceptable."
Not gonna trust this company again! This is the 2nd time that all my parcel is delayed from an expedited and the website is not updated! I dont know why this company still running with how they treat theyre customers. My package from hongkong came exatly 3 days via FedEx and that is like the other side of the world. But this company took 2 weeks from Toronto to Guelph? and expecdited!? LOL Crazy!
"WORST WORST WORST SERVICE. THEY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. My order has been in transit since the 19th, It was supposed to be expedited. If they were not able to accommodate a quick delivery they SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN THE PACKAGE!!!!!!!!!! No excuse NONE. I received other things I ordered after this within 48 hours. DISGUSTING EXCUSE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."
"NEVER EVER SEND/RECV ANYTHING FROM CANADA POST. My parcel was supposed to be deliver between March 23rd-April 1st but that never happen. I created numerous tickets , emails , chats but all I heard was we will let you know for next step. and then they asked me to contact sender so that the sender can claim for lost item. THE CANADA POST TRACKING WEBSITE IS NOTHING BUT A JOKE THAT STAYS ON FREEZE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. All it says the item is in Mississauga, In transit. I asked them why should I contact the sender when the item is already with Canada post at Mississauga which they replied so that they can claim for the lost item. I HATE CANADA POST
After learning from the other reviews of Canada post, I realize they are thieves who are stealing people valuables. Like some other people I ordered face masks worth 105$ but they stole it."
Would give less than 1 star but it‚Äôs not an option. Terrible
"they don't even bother to check the right adress and when they do, they don't even knock."
"When i checked my parcel expected to arrive today from Brampton to Toronto. I saw the item was processed last night in Winnipeg, Manitoba. That‚Äôs amazing, why don‚Äôt Canada post puts my parcel on a rocket, send it to the moon and deliver it back?"
"Terrible company....been waiting for my laptop for 4 extra days because they seem to have lost my package...then on top of that when they finially do get around to delivering it, no attempt was ever made. Iv been home patiently waiting all day. To finially check the tracker # and they never ever came in the building they. stuck the GD door tag on the outside of the building so anyone could grab it. So all in all. If you have the ability don't use them. Pay the extra 4$ for Purolator of fed ex. Lest it will get to where it's going on time and with and accually attempt being made for delivery"
I was expecting a package yesterday.According the the tracking information it was delivered to a address in Mississauga Ontario. The only problem is I live in Montreal Quebec. The tracking information is really unreliable. If you can choose an alternate delivery service I'd do so.
"I have already placed a ticket.The response to my ticket said nothing except that they would notify me when the item arrived. No explanation. I was told that if I did not receive my package after a week of the expected delivery date that they would email me on the next steps. I imagine they will tell me I'm out of luck and to get a refund or something.This tells me they have no clue where it is. If the item was truly tracked, they would know where it is. NOT the expedited service I payed for. I understand that Covid-19 is causing issues... but I would like the courtesy of knowing the situation. If Canada Post lost the package I would like to know. I paid over $18 for the tracking service. I'm not being petty... I'm furious that they have the nerve to charge for a service they don't provide. I've had issues with them many times before Covid 19. I call and get nowhere... busy signal or says no one is available. It says to try later. It also informs me to do the redundant thing of looking online.
Online it informs me to phone or look up my tracking number.... I go on and click my tracking number... shows ""in transit"" but it's actually frozen for a week now 3 provinces away... going around in circles with NO information. It is clear that there is no way that I will be receiving the package by tomorrow if it is STILL 3 provinces away! Not physically possible. I will NOT be using the tracking method in the future and am recommending others not to pay for the tracking service either. It's a waste of money and during this pandemic people need not spend money for nothing. It's a cash grab. It's money spent for a false sense of security. It simply does not help the situation, Canada Post does not hold itself accountable for where these packages may be. They are merely waiting, hoping for someone to scan the package in some warehouse (sorting facility) so they can ""see"" where it is. How is this tracking? Hope for the best? What is the point of paying for a service to track an item if the supposed tracking method is not used to locate the item? I was obviously wrong and assumed that when tracking an item... Canada Post would know right down to which vehicle and which driver had it last and that info was sent to a central data bank (some form of record keeping) immediately every time something changed. That is tracking and accountability.
Very disappointed."
"I ve the same experiences as everyone here , waiting on my package for a week now , no follow ups ,service tickets been created and nothing's changed although the agent said they will follow up with emails , atleast get the tracker right or what's the point, I had no choice in using them and not buying from any supplier that uses them moving fwd"
"I ordered Face Masks online - I received tracking information from the seller. It said it was released by Canadian Customs on April 5,2020 and was ""last updated"" on Canada Post tracking on April 7,2020. That's what my expected delivery date was. When I use my tracking number it says ""In Transit"". It is now April 22,2020 and still no progress. I've contacted Canada Post three separate times already and their customer service keeps telling me ""to wait until someone follows up with me"". Every time I try and follow up they say there's nothing they can do in terms of providing additional information about why my package is not moving. Online it keeps saying it's in a Canada Post facility but there are no updates about why it hasn't moved. The customer service rep said that the ""In Transit"" update does not necessarily mean it is in a moving truck- ""In Transit"" means it's in a holding facility awaiting the next steps of the delivery process. I have been waiting patiently but there has been no progress. They have my name and phone#. I even started a Service Ticket with them. I have still not heard back from them and I'm really disappointed that as of my last call with them, I am now responsible for asking for a refund from the seller. I don't want a refund. I just want my masks delivered to me. Why should I have to involve the seller if it's Canada Post who is having issued with my item? What is the purpose of making a service ticket with Customer Service if they're not helping me? I don't even think it's fair to ask for a refund from the seller because I can clearly see they shipped me my item. It's Canada Post that has misplaced/lost/is being slow with my order."
"Another spectacular failure by Canada Post
Package from Toronto to Ottawa 7 days and counting
The parcel was sitting in Toronto for 5 days, and now 2 days somewhere in Ottawa.
Online assistant is just useless P.O.S excuse for service.
Phone lines do not accept calls.
Shame on you CP!
There wasn't single word about any delivery problems when the postage was paid!"
How do you miss a city 3 times when the customer pays for express.. literally drive to my city to bring it to the next 3 times. SMH...
"Canada post is the absolute worst. Nothing comes on time, their tracking system is useless (waiting on a package for 3 days and the tracking still says delivery expected 3 days ago). Embarrassing considering how reliable the completion is now."
"Terrible terrible service. Ordered a bunch of expensive items around 2 weeks ago, including a new phone valued at $1000, didn‚Äôt have any choice in choosing Canada post or not or I wouldn‚Äôt of but it seems I‚Äôm waiting for all my items to be delivered by them. My expected delivery date was yesterday and today and a few next week, but I have not received my first order nor did I receive my second (my phone). Already created service tickets for both items, called every post office in my city of miramichi, tracking number does nothing but tell me it‚Äôs on its way when it‚Äôs been travelling for over 4-5 days now from Ontario/Quebec to New Brunswick? That‚Äôs a day drive, 2 TOPS with rests. I called the customer service number for them to just tell me they have nobody available for calls and it just says goodbye and hangs up? Like what? No option to wait, like where is my packages?? I have express and expatiated shipping, this is outrageous. I understand delays with coronavirus happening, that‚Äôs completely understandable but at least let the customer know so we‚Äôre not let down when we sit around waiting all day waiting for our package to arrive, is my package lost, is it coming like is it broken? Like what‚Äôs going on?"
"I payed for expedited service. No delivery for 10 days. This is not even acceptable during the COVID-19 situation. They should NOT charge people for this. They practically STEALING your money for a service you wont get.

Last week the guy running wellington branch in Ottawa showed up 25 mins late

During their strike 3 years ago, they lost an important legal document in the mail (sent by sender and I have never received)

This company is not doing great. I have lived abroad in different places and basic services mail/courier service were never an issue. What a shame."
"Terrible, terrible service multiple times, even before Covid-19 began. I'm immunocompromised and have been advised by my GP not to go out -- so I used Rexall's Direct to door delivery service. What did Canada post do? They left a, ""Unable to deliver"" note for me -- and I live in a condo with 24-hour concierge! So, to get the medicine the next day, I had to go three blocks out to the local Shoppers Drug Mart, eliminating the entire reason I used the direct to door delivery service in the first place. I will NEVER use Canada Post as my preferred postal service again."
"Just the absolute worst service, I've had multiple items delivered by Canada Post and about 95% of the time they're late or lost. Their customer service reps are so used to people complaining that they barely bother to try and help resolve your issues. They'll happily charge you for ""priority"" shipping and then deliver the package days later than the promised delivery date."
Package picked up by Canada Post on March 20th in Richmond Hill still shows no movement on April 21st. One package from Canpar express took less than a week after being shipped on April 13th and delivered on April 16th. I understand that these are surreal times but one month? Was told the shipper would have to make a claim; Shipper told me that Canada Post blamed COVID.
"Terrible service.
No usable tracking info.
Never attempt delivery of actual shipped package, just put notification card in mailbox, even while I‚Äôm home, every time, and even before covid19, it‚Äôs just an excuse to justify the lack of service now. Sad."
"If I pay for SIGNATURE REQUIRED then I expect a signature.
These monkeys left a firearm on the doorstep of my house in Toronto, about 6 feet from a busy pedestrian walkway"
"In brief, Canada Post sucks. The worst delivery service ever used. And we pay for this, just unbelievable. I ordered on March 27 some products from the Jean Coutu down the street for delivery during this coronavirus situation. They arrived today April 21. No doubt the excuse is the coronavirus; however all sellers are in the same boat and yet all of them that I bought from that did not use Canada Post managed to deliver in a timely way and one, just one day off from estimated delivery date. And this one apologized to me for late delay -- something that will never happen with Canada Post, just have to be happy that you get the item -- I guess they operate on the principle of ""better late than never"". Moreover, the web site also sucks, Tons of topics but nothing useful -- the phone number can never be reached unless you wait an hour at least to get through and then if you are patient enough to get through, no information is forthcoming about where your package is or when you will get it, notwithstanding that under their tracking system, they indicate that it was supposed to be mailed last week. And then it is very usual to get the message that your parcel will be delivered that afternoon at the end of the day yet the same notification indicates that it is in transit on a later date -- it makes no sense! And the person on the phone can't help you!!!! Can hardly wait until this service is privatized -- I will be the first to cast my vote to get rid of it."
"Joke of a postal service. Don't trust any valuable packages, let alone any packages with them. Go ahead and spend your money on UPS or FedEx. Legitimate joke. Unless you want a headache, long time to reach support, and answers to nothing, go ahead and choose Canada Post."
"Well, clearly... They just suck. Under pressure they buckled hard. They don't have dedicated workers or happy workers. So they have just gone down hill so fast."
"I get that with COVID-19 shipping may be a bit slower than normal, but it feels like Canada Post is using that as an excuse to just not deliver anything at all. In the time it's taken for my package to arrive (which it still hasn't 11 business days later...), I have ordered numerous other items via Amazon Delivery, FedEx, and UPS all of which arrived within a couple of days.

How is it that every single other delivery service can actually deliver, but Canada Post can't seem to?"
"A package shipped from Victoria BC for me yesterday, and it is out for delivery in Toronto today. That is via UPS.

Now I get that things are a little crazy right now with the COVID19, bit if UPS can get my package across the country over night, then CP should be able to do the same. Or atleast hold to their estimated delivery date (a week after shipping) absolutely unacceptable."
Had a package enter Canada March 18th from DHL. No idea where it is or what's going on with it. I absolutely cannot believe it.
"Well i guess im not alone in my disgust in CP, getting a delivery date, wait all day then nothing. tracking number is a joke, the only answer i get is , dont worry your package is always moving, what the hell does that even mean anyway. absolute worst service ever"
"The expected delivery date is false, they will delay delivering your parcel without telling you, if you're delaying a delivery at least let the customer know so they don't have to be disappointed. Out of all the other couriers Canada Post is the worst one out of all of them."
"A week after expected delivery I placed a service ticket to find my parcel, and all I got was an unusable/unhelpful ticket number for my time. Calling in, an automated service told me they weren't taking calls. Expected delivery, tracking and customer service are just a joke. Pretty sure CP doesn't know what the word ""expedited"" means. There's snail mail and then there's CanadaPost's glacial mail."
The expected delivery date is a total joke. Why set an expectation just to disappoint people.
"If you always want to receive a parcel later than expected, choose Canada Post."
So I goes to my community mail box 2 weeks ago and the key goes in the lock but won't turn so I fill out the appropriate online form a week later I get an email saying the problem is fixed and there was a notice to go pick up new keys. I get there to pick them up and apparently they are charging me 30 dollars. Honestly what the hell is that about it's not like I personally went out and broke the mailbox why am I having to pay for it. And to top off there was nothing on the paper about paying so I'm broke so I can't get mail until I have more money so utterly ridiculous I am fuming.
"Each time that I order something and it has been delivered by Canada Post, something wrong happens. 99% of the time they don't even knock before they leave a notice. I am teleworking, I am home (especially with Covid 19) and they literally don't run away from my door as soon as they leave the notice... why? I simply don't get it. Even pre Covid 19, they would always give me the notice before they would knock. I simply don't understand. I don't want to pay for this kind of service... rather go for any other competitors to be honest."
"You could take a lesson from Amazon .One day means One Day service delivery.

8 days from Brampton to London then sits
in a warehouse I still don't have the parcel.
Your donkeys have no Idea.

Amazon Postal Service. I vote ..YES."
"Worst!!!!!
Don't trust them if you really need to send something on time.
BS excuses!"
"Package coming late, really bad service"
They lost my passport two years ago and today they lost it again.
"If you cannot navigate your way from Newmarket to Bradford, you should not be in the DELIVERY business.
If you cannot appropriately respond to your customers' requests, then you shouldn't BE in business at all!

The End."
"I worked at CP for a bit and can say the staff are top notch and care about the mail. That said with unresolved union issues that the government forced to return to work, staff do not trust management. This makes everything crap.
From a customer point of view, they are slow. So slow. I tried to call and online customer service yesterday and was kicked out of line on every attempt. In a free marketplace its only a matter of time until there company fails. Sorry. It already has."
I would give Canada Post a big fat zero if I could. I live in just outside Calgary and I am waiting for a letter to arrive from Vancouver. It has been 12 days and it still isn't here. Covid or no Covid 12 days to go from one major Canadian city to another is not acceptable! What a poor organization.
Ordered an S20 ultra and the tracking is not updated in 5 days now and I have Xpresspost... seriously? 1500 phone and its probably lost üôÑ
"They should just give it to a private company ! I sent a letter next day delivery and paid $14 for an envelope to be delivered literally 57 km away (Hamilton to Toronto). It's 4 business days after and no clue even where's my letter !!! If I knew they are such a failure, I would have driven it to Toronto myself !!!

Stay away from Canada Post. This is last time I use their services. What a failure."
"I have no problem if they want to stop working during the pandemic. But why keep the facade? Just close doors instead of getting our packages delivered 2 week later than supposed. Mine is 10 days late already and I have no clue how long it will really take, according to their subpar tracking website, it's still in Ontario and hasn't left the place yet. All others like FedEx and Purolator delivered all my other computer pieces in time."
Just the worse avoid if you can..
"CP ripping people off by accepting their money for Xpresspost delivery , and consistently failing to make guaranteed delivery . IF YOU CANT GUARANTEE YOUR SERVICE , STOP OFFERING AND CHARGING FOR IT . This is criminal ."
"I'm yet another of many VERY unsatisfied customers with this lazy excuse for a mail service. I'm currently waiting for 5 parcels that are coming regular mail and I have received NONE of them. One of them is at the 11 day mark and I should have gotten it at the 5 day mark. I mean c'mon now, this is ridiculous. ALL of these parcels are coming from within Canada where I also live not in f****ng timbuktwo. The only positive thing that i can say is that a couple of weeks back I received 2 parcels but they had tracking numbers so in my case that made a bit of a difference."
WORST TRACKING SYSTEM EVER I WILL NEVER EVER SEND ANYTHING WITH POST CANADA EVER AGAIN
CANADA POST FuUCKING SUCKS! Lazy useless peices of shiittt countless times have i waited at home for a package to arrive and these fuckking cock snots NEVER show up. Tracking says card left to pick up at post office..... and guess what? NO FUCKIiNG CARD IS LEFT BECAUSE THE LAZY TWAaT GOBBLING ASSsHOLE NEVER CAME IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!!! Shut this fuckiing company down!
"Why aren‚Äôt they making it public they are struggling, and looking for help... just over two weeks ago I had a delivery across the country in 2 days, now it‚Äôs over 2 weeks same distance. I really doubt they‚Äôll take these criticisms seriously by the other responses lol if it‚Äôs about safety they should ask the government for to approve the quick covid tests that are used in other countries"
Useless pieces of shiite! I've been waiting for 17 days for an Express Post parcel. They update every couple of days saying it out for delivery when it does not delivered. They say it's the covid-19. My sister sent me a card from Toronto eight days ago. It arrived. It was sent regular post. They can't seem to deliver packages on time at all. They are all uses pieces of shiite.
9am on April 11 we dropped of a parcel and were told if we paid for express post it would be delivered in 2 days. The parcel was required next week. I was told no problem. When I tracked it the delivery time is April 20th at end of day. You wait about an hour on their customer service line only to get a rude agent that can only tell you what she can‚Äôt do. Could not even put me through to her Supervisor. TERRIBLE! There are other options; Will be using other courier services going forward.
"Parcels need to be updated more frequently on the online tracking, it might also lower the call volume. Every time i have ever tried to call there has been a wait. let the customers know hat their packages are being delayed for whatever reason. UPDATE the delivery date if its been missed and package has not been delivered. Also, might i add that the customer service representatives are awful. I had a lady practically yell at me at one point and a man have such a disgusting attitude. IF YOU DONT LIKE YOUR JOB GET A NEW ONE. there should be no reason to take your anger out on a customer asking questions. ITS YOUR JOB TO ANSWER THEM. Train your employees better."
Order didn‚Äôt show up when expected. That‚Äôs fine I get it. Four days late now and tracking shows the package has not moved since seller dropped to cp. Called customer service and spoke to a rep who basically said too bad and still wouldn‚Äôt tell me where my package was. Rep said maybe next week. I paid for expedited service what a rip off. I wish I had just picked it up myself since it was less than 2hrs away. I asked if I could just get it wherever it is and was told I‚Äôd have to basically jump through hoops to make that happen. I will avoid from now on. I wish they could‚Äôve just been honest about eta.
"Overnight shipping took a week and a day to arrive. Out for delivery meant that it waited on the delivery truck for 2 days according to their tracking system. When I called to complain, it arrived within the hour, but it shouldn't have had to come to that."
sent my package to the post office on the other side of the city. huge waste of time.
"currently this is my issue:

Received by Canada Post
Apr. 8

In transit
Apr. 16

Expected delivery
Apr. 14
by end of day
????"
"My package supposed to arrive on the 14th, today is 16th and find out they sent the package to Windsor from Toronto and the package supposed to be delivered to Owen Sound. Canada Post review shows 1.2 stars out of 5!!! Realy!? Total joke! This is my last time using your services Canada Post!!!"
"Absolutely terrible service-why don't they just shut Canada post down during the pandemic. They are not shipping anything or letting people know there is a problem. Tracking lately is non existent- or just stuck somewhere. Obviously, postal service is not considered an essential service, since it's not happening lately. They should just shut down and allow private couriers to actually get the job done."
"Should be out of business, they are terrible with delivering. These turds that bring mail expect to get paid more yet cannot get an item from cities that are an hour apart within the span of a week. What do you morons go on strike for, you don‚Äôt deserve a raise they should lower your pay and get rid of the lot of you. I could understand if my package was coming from outside the province or the country with what‚Äôs going on but there‚Äôs no excuse for how long it has been, like pull yourselves together or stop delivering packages and give it to a company like amazon who actual deliver and have great service."
I swear my package is being delivered by horse and buggy. it took them 27 hrs for my package to travel 45 minutes from the other city to mine. now it is finially checked into my city with no indication of being delivered. what's the point of paying extra money for Express if they dont oh I dunno express your package... was told delivery was the 14th. well now the 15th and its sitting there while they go duuuuuuurrrrr... not happy
I have never had a good experience with Canada post. They make way to many mistakes with the orders. It takes them forever to deliver something that would take any other company 2 days to deliver and more than once they claimed that I was there for a delivery when I was not. Canada Post is the worst and we should have a different company doing all the deliveries in Canada because Canada Post obviously cant handle it.
"If i could, I would never use them again in my life. They don't attempt deliveries, they just leave the notice and walk away. I can promise you no attempt was attempted!"
Worst ever. No internet updates on the parcel. You never know anything it takes forever.
"Canada post should be completely eliminated.
I don't understand how the hell they operate.. They're a cluster fk.. How in the hell does local mail take more than a week is beyond me.. Delivery dates are waaaay off. In comparison to Amazon? Amazon is always in top of everything. Not once have I been disappointed with Amazon..Get rid of Canada post already!! They can't be trusted! Honestly, replace Canada post with Amazon delivery service."
My item has been processed in the same place more than 5 times with no explanation and my package isnt going to arrive in the time the seller guarantees because of canada post. God forbid these people go on strike again
Absolutely deplorable customer service. Not only has my package it‚Äôs not arrived after 3 1/2 weeks without an update. Their customer service is just a virtual assistant that condescendingly ask is there anything they can do for you knowing that they only have one generate a response for every single question which means it‚Äôs totally pointless to even have. You don‚Äôt gain anything by talking to a virtual assistant all the information is already provided in the tracking list what the fucc is the point?
"currently on the 14th business day for my express post what a unorganized gong show
most unprofessional courier service I've ever dealt with even there phone line is slow like there service"
"painfully slow shipping, expensive, terrible tracking and brutal customer service!! i cant think of anything positive to say. if i could give 0 stars i would,"
If I could give Canada post no stars I would. Been waiting a month for a laptop so I can start work from home. It said it was going to be delivered over 2 weeks ago. Still in transit huh? For 2 weeks it even says they are in my city.
"Canada Post Tracking - Well I think you should junk the tracking system for certain typre of parcels. If you can't do the tracking just eliminate it. You are wasting a lot of your and our resources, If you can't add value just admit it and we will be happy without your false pretend."
"The only consistent aspect of Canada Post's service is how terrible it is! I made a purchase on April 1st (2020) from a seller I have purchased from multiple times without issue. They created a shipping label the next day but it hasn't made any progress to date. I contacted the seller last Monday, and he assured me he had shipped it out with multiple other orders that very same day. Come Wednesday, when I still saw no progress I decided to contact Canada Post (number 70 in que btw!!) just to be told that as far as they could tell the package was never received and it's up to the seller to launch an escalation. The seller can't send replacements or process a refund until their investigation is over.. so I'm stuck in limbo indefinitely. Thanks Canada Post!

**Update: the item arrived at the Post office today (April 27) and is ready for pickup. Toronto to Montreal."
"March 2019 lost my iPhone from Koodo. Took 2 week's to track it down.

March 2020 all packages are now being held hostage as Canada Post closes before all deliverys are processed. Now I'm waiting all long weekend as they need the extra time off."
"This is the 3rd time in as many months that the postperson has stuck a parcel in my letter delivery box that I cannot extract from the door of the box (with the parcel delivery box about 2 feet away). I think the person is doing it on purpose, like they hate me for asking for parcel #1 to be placed in a larger box (one of the parcel boxes) so that I could get it.

It's too much. Just because a parcel can be dropped into the letter box does not mean it can be extracted from the letter box door that I access. Additional hardware is there, making that door smaller than the one the delivery person accesses. I can't believe that they don't know that. Maybe they hate Amazon - although that may be one of the few reasons they have a job.

I'm sick of it. So stupid that I have to keep spending my time phoning Canada post, creating a ticket, then wait for the post person to move the package to an accessible mail box. There isn't even an email for complaints & problems. You have to take time and explain to someone what the problem is, and they then have to produce a ticket no. and on and on.

I live in Vancouver. 610 1035 Pacific Street. V6E 4G7 This happens over and over again. It feels deliberate. Can you please do something about it."
Terrible service. Over 9 days from pick up to delivery of an expedited parcel. I will never trust Canada Post with my deliverys again. Total distance was 18 Km.
"I ordered something Xpress Sunday and its Thursday night and my package still hasn't arrived.

It was 'out for delivery' all day today but never came so I'm guessing its back at a facility?

Except its a long weekend now so I won't get it until Tuesday. All because you guys can't pay overtime to finish a damn truck. You cannot even do a package in one week. I hate you Canada Post."
"The worst service being provided by a so called crown corporation. I was advised my delivery was picked up on Apr 7 and delivery end of day Apr 8. No delivery, still shows delivery by end of day Apr 8, but this is Apr 9 and still shows in transit. I called on hold 18mins was in a queue of 136 people then I was cut off. Called back later and on hold 39 mins doesn't seem important that I reside in an apartment building 18 floors, where No One received mail in a couple of days, but we know it‚Äôs in the truck for delivery, where is the driver? Hasn‚Äôt been around for a couple of days. So Easter gift that the company sent out on time will not be delivered because Canada post doesn‚Äôt care if mail gets delivered. If this was the only time this happened not an issue, however my daughter was sent a parcel from Hamilton, Ont and was sent saying it would be delivered Mar 25 and it was not put in our mailbox until April 2nd, where was it you ask? In the Cda post mail truck. I could have driven and picked up package same day if we would have known the extremely poor service from what should be a proud Canadian company. If you want delivery and quality service do not use Canada post."
Worst delivery service ever! Never comes on time guaranteed delivery is a joke. Promised delivery today for Easter and at 8:30pm they say it will now not come until Tuesday. Never buy anything that uses Canada Post.
"I paid for express post on Sunday in order for my grand kids to get their Easter parcel. It is now Thursday at 5:40 and parcel is not delivered. Of course Canada Post does not deliver Saturday or Sundays so my grandchildren have to wait until next week or never for their parcel. I have been online with their Virtual Assistant for well over 30 minutes and even though it says 0 minutes before I have contact with an assistant, the system seems to be locked with no one home. This is the 2nd time Canada post has not delivered on time with Express Post. I will NEVER use Canada post again."
My package with express post was 2 days late. Due to Easter weekend I have to wait another 4 days and no guarentee . Why does anyone ship with Canada post?
I wish I could give zero stars. I have had so many issues. This one tops the cake. I'm told by a very rude woman that due to covid-19 delivery times are not guaranteed (even when paid extra for). Ok fine.. but my issue had nothing to do with that but with the fact that the postal worker neglected to out my item on the damned truck to bring to my city. They screwed up with their manifest. She tried to argue with me even tho I had that information from 2 previous sources before ever speaking to her. A request for a call back with whatever department it is who handles this stuff was put in... I was told 4 hrs. And guess what? No call. This is the second instance where canada post couldn't be bothered to contact me for issues due to their negligence. I honestly hate this company but unfortunately as a recipient I have no control over how merchants send their goods. Total crap!
Spent over an hour trying to sign into the Canada Post website. Says it recognized my email but can‚Äôt get logged in. The security questions are RIDICULOUS! Where did your parents meet? Are you kidding? I wasn‚Äôt around. What was your first car? I‚Äôm 66 years old. I have no idea. What a waste of time and taxpayers money. I have to go to the post office to fill out a form to get my mail forwarded....same old same old. Why are taxpayers funding this useless organization who can‚Äôt even design a simple website?
"Terrible delivery service. Packages are rarely on time. It's always something with Canada post I am so fed up with their lack of care for their delivery standards. I ordered an item, paid for Express shipping, which was suppose to be 2 to 3 days, it's been 5 days and my parcel has still not been delivered. You pay extra for Express shipping because you want your stuff to come asap but it's like they don't even care, actually lemme rephrase that, They DO NOT CARE! It's frustrating because it's like, pay more for 2-3 day Express shipping? Oh let's just delivery your item when ever the hell we feel like. And this is not the first time, stiff like this happens all the time with them. They take their time doing everythiny. They lie about delivery times and when stuff is supposed to be delivered. smh. In conclusion, It don't even make sense paying extra for shipping because they'll just deliver it when ever the hell they want to."
"Canada post is the worst mail service ever. Tried to pay to forward a business post office box and they charged me for personal... Then made me come back in and pay for business forwarding and refused to refund the first one even though I had asked for business forwarding in the first place!

Packages are Never delivered to my door step even when I have been home all day they always slap a notice instead.

Our mailboxes were compromised and they just changed all the locks for all the boxes in the neighborhood, didn't communicate with anyone we all had to just figure out what happened on our own and call in to customer service to request new keys and we got the run around saying that the locks must all be frozen and that's why their not working. I had to explain to them that the police had called me to return a recovered package and that I knew the boxes had been compromised before they would believe me that I needed a new key? How the heck could they not know all our locks had been changed? They don't even communicate internally!

Nothing but frustration with Canada post...makes me ashamed that they have the word Canada in their name!"
"So beyond mad.
Canada post randomly decides to change the mail boxes, DURING a pandemic might I add. I tried my usual mail box nothing works, I ran into one of the postal people and they said ""they've all been changed they got mixed up, try your key in every one."" So we took a walk tried EVERY box in our neighborhood, with no luck. So now I cant get my ei cheque due to being laid off, due to there being a pandemic.

So I decided to call, after 3 hours of being on the phone. Being jumped from person to person, having them not understand i am trying to locate where my mail box is going to be. To finally be told it will take 3 days to locate the box/find out what they are doing with potential new keys.
You. Have. To. Be. Joking.
So great, I will not be able to make payments towards my mortgage, or buy groceries.

Thank you canada post for literally f'ing me.

-sincerely,
Severely Angry."
"So tired of Canada Post tracking system that gives false delivery times. Oh Canada, what a farce!!! From now on, if a company that I order from uses Canada Post to deliver, I will cancel the order."
If I could review a 0 stars I would. I ordered a parcel from Best Buy in the first week of March before every store was closed for quarantine in Ontario. It is now coming to the end of the first week of April and my package moved from N.S. to NB in 18 days. I could have walked to Nova Scotia and back to Ontario in that time and picked it up myself. What a pathetic service. Not to mention... it never updates where it is....
"I understand there is covid still present within Canada. I understand that employees need to practice social distancing but this postal service delay is absolutely disgusting.... mail taking weeks to come from other province within Canada. Xpresspost is not updated. No update scans on the system. What's the hold up on people's mail. Seriously. Mail is an essential service . Canada post doesn't take pride in doing their job what the staff cant wear a mask and gloves and work? this is nonsense. Disgusting
Never seen such lackluster service you never know when your mail is coming it's a shame what this world has come to."
"No attempt was made to deliver my package from Amazon, yet Canada Post communicated to Amazon that my package had been delivered, which was a total lie. The mail carriers are incredibly lazy, it is disgusting. Canada Post does not care about putting our health at risk, having to go to outlets to pick up our packages when they should have done their job. They should be ashamed of themselves. This is the time they need to step up and show Canada that they can be leaders.....sadly disappointed."
Was expecting a delivery today. Showed up in my neighbourhood but delivered to my neighbours when it clearly had my address on it. Took off. No ticket for pick up at post office and my neighour was the one to return my item. It makes me wonder how many of my items have gotten delivered elsewhere.
"My parcel was late *understandably* with everything going on I understand. Except when the communication was so poor that I‚Äôm left wondering what‚Äôs going on.

I paid for delivery of the item almost a month ago, just when the pandemic hit hard, and I braced myself for a long wait. It‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs only a desk! I don‚Äôt drive and I can‚Äôt carry it from the post office.

Come today, it‚Äôs suppose to be delivered. I wait up for the delivery and nothing. That‚Äôs fine let‚Äôs check tracking.

‚ÄúNotice card left‚Äù

I did not have ANYONE even approach my home, the snow from yesterday is untouched and no ‚Äúnotice card‚Äù left behind and now, I‚Äôll have to find a way to walk my desk from the post office 26 blocks home! To awkward to fit on the bus and too heavy to make it a nice stroll.

Thanks Canada Post! For going out of your way to ruin something so simple. If I had a choice to use your service or...anything(?) I‚Äôd go with anything. Even a dog sled would have tried."
You guys should use USPS as an example. They provide more frequently updated tracking and faster service in general. Canada Post doesn't update tracking until it gets to my door. SMH
"I know it is a very difficult time, but what I experienced here should not happen.
An important parcel suppose to arrive and I checked the delivery status, it says it got sent back to the sender. I got so confused and I checked the tracking history. It says it sent to Richmond, and then got sent back. Richmond is not even the district the address is pointing. Because the sender of the package already left the place they sent the parcel and the parcel is going to be unclaimed. So I called the customer service and told him the situation. He kept telling me that unfortunately, your parcel got sent back to the sender. I ASKED HIM the reason why it was sent back. He kept telling me the same sentence again and again, which drives me insane(I have no idea why there is a problem of communication, don't we speak the same human language???). Man, I HAVE EYES and I can see that it got sent back, and I ALREADY know that it is very unfortunate. I asked him for the address that they sent to before sending it back to sender. He told me that they don't have information about the address. It is ridiculous, how can a delivery service do not record the place that the parcel goes. It is totally unfortunate for delivering this important parcel within this service and we paid for it:)(make me want to laugh). I can understand that it is a difficult time and people make mistakes(I can understand that). What made me really mad is that, the customer service gives me a sense of that Canada post does not care about the quality of their service and even does not try to solve the issue. I read a lot of bad reviews and I believe it is time for Canada post to realize that something is wrong."
"I have been a customer of Canada post my whole life. I ordered a new laptop from the Source online. Said it would be here yesterday. Package was shipped from Missisauga, Ontario. Package got to Halifax....then instead of sending it on to Truro, Nova Scotia...it's destination.....they send it to Winnipeg, M.B......what the heck ? So now it has been processed in Montreal and is on it's way back here I presume to Nova Scotia. This is the first time I have ever had a problem like this with Canada Post . I know we are in trying times ...but Truro, N.S. looks nothing like Winnipeg, M.B. when printed on a shipping lable !! Not impressed !! Hopefully I will still receive it in the next few days !!"
"Why is Canada Post as well as stores allowed to charge customers past March 19 2020 for priority or express post shipping when Canada post will guarantee the shipping times? How many places have receive notice about their customers not getting their parcel within a reasonable time and still continue to charge for this kind of shipping? I Understand crap happens sometimes believe me. But I ordered after March 19 and was offered express post shipping. I paid for this shipping. And now it‚Äôs an oh well it‚Äôs not guaranteed. If you could not guarantee it then why was it even being offered? Canada post says talk to the shipper, and the shipper don‚Äôt want to do anything of course. In this world one does not pay for something one does not receive no matter the excuse. But they will send out checks for those people too bloody ignorant to use direct deposit no problem. They will charge you for 2-5 business day shipping knowing it will be at least 2 weeks or maybe more no problem as well.

So tired of this. So tired of Canada Post, so tired of all the sheep who are terrified of ‚Äúcatching‚Äù a virus. One does not ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a virus as a virus is not contagious. Think about that please.. Would you ‚Äúcatch‚Äù HIV from a handshake? Question everything and research everything. You are getting your information from sources who are all owned and operated by the government. How many times must they lie and steal from you and your children before you wake up."
"honestly every time I *have* (as in I can't choose another courier service) something gets screwed up. They are awful, have never had a good experience with them."
"So today I was expecting a package. I did not go to work today and I was waiting the whole day. They said it would arrive by 8pm today and currently it is 7:23 with no notice. When I ordered the package on amazon it has said it shipped and is arriving today. Canada post workers are lazy, there customer service is VERY VERY POOR. This will be the last time with this dog poo of a mail service. Pathetic."
"I can't believe a company that is being made redundant in this world is so useless at the one thing they were founded on. I have the same package delivered every month. it is left in the lobby, then today they leave a note for me to use my free time to go get it. I paid to have it delivered! I hope you all know how you let down so many and take not ownership of that."
"Has taken less time to get a parcel from Asia/across Pacific than it takes to deliver a parcel from BC to Alberta.
Pathetic."
"It's one of the worst run mail systems out there.

I can't count how many times that I've had packages shipped to me and they arrive several days late. Or that the posties will write up a delivery notice and not even bother bringing the package to the door but instead just knock once, very lightly, slap the notice on the door and try to leave. I've been home more than once, close to the door and have had to chase them down to the truck to get my package because they're unwilling to take 30 seconds out of their day and would rather you go to the local Shopper's Drug Mart to pick it up. And heaven forbid this is on a Friday. You'll have to wait until Tuesday to get your things because they just leave the truck at the depot, lock it up and not bother to unload it until Monday.

I have no problems with companies like UPS, FedEx or any other delivery company."
"Waiting for my package to be delivered this morning. The delivery van pulled up to my condo and i was waiting to let him in, then I see the van pull away.
i go downstairs to check for a tag and there was one in my mailbox to pickup parcel tomorrow. The guy was in my building but didn't delivery to me. So Canada Post would rather for me to go out around others and still deal with a Canada Post employee to get the package. Not Impressed!!!

If they want to cut down on service they should cut down on the price!!!"
"Delivery within the same city, estimated arrival, 1-11 BUSINESS DAYS."
Canda post the worst mail carrier ever!!!!! Mailman will post online attempted delivery while i watched their trucks go by our place and i even approached to ask the mailman if he has my package but none. Then they will indicate attempted delivery even if they NEVER DID!!!!! SO MY PACKAGE COMING FROM EDMONTON TO FORT MCMURRAY MOST OF THE TIME TAKES AT LEAST A WEEK OR 8 DAYS AND I PAY HOW MUCH?????? JUST TO GET MY PACKAGE ON TIME BUT NEVER I RECEIVE MY PACKAGE ON TIME. MY MEDICATION EVEN EXPIRED BEFORE I GET IT COZ IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE FRIDGE AFTER 3 DAYS BUT CANADA POST SUCKKKKSSSS!!!!! YOU GUYS ARE THE WORST EVER SO EMBARASSING YOU ARE CARRYING OUR COUNTRY'S NAME BUT YOUR SERVICE TOTALLY SUCKS!!!!!!
"Well into Day 8 ..actually no Day 9 update...says package to be delivered today but my post man said well thats wrong all the packages are done for the day..so if its Monday now I get it that will be Day 12 and no sign of this pakcage. Ridiculous ( supposed to be a 2 day)...now like every other day it says on Tracker its been processed over 3 times in the same facility in Stoney Creek (15 mins from my house) over a 2 day period. and every night it say will be there tomorrow..then another tomorrow comes and it says the following day again...tomorrow is day 9 and I have no confidence I will ever see this package which by the way was mailed expresspost within the same province of Ontario. My wife ordered a safe from Walmart on line Monday night got that delivered by UPS wed morning and she also ordered a new phone on line from Bell on Tuesday and we got that wed afternoon from Purolater..Horrendous service this Canada Post . Stay out of the courier business your terrible at it. The supervisors and higher ups all should be fired in this organization . PS my mail man said its not covid 19 thats slowing it down as they are not back loogged at all at any distribution sites and their all working so no excuses other than they are just a mismanaged mess of an organization...you couldnt get me to use this service again if it was tottally ""FREE"" update finally got package day 14..at 2pm on the afternoon. Amen . never again canada post I tell ya ..good riddens"
"This review would be minus 10 if I could. I absolutely hate Canada Post; just try to complain to them and see how far you get! I've tried several times now. The issue is that the delivery people say that they've delivered your parcel when they don't even ring the buzzer in an apartment building. I am a senior, retired, and I am always home when I'm told a package is coming. I even watch online to see when it is out for delivery. I once lived in a house with a large front window from which I could watch the Canada Post van drive up. One day the van drove up and while I watched, the delivery person filled in the form that states ""we were unable to deliver your parcel"". As I walked to the side door to greet them, they drove off and I was left with the form. They never even tried to knock; had they turned their head, they would have seen me watching. I've complained and written reviews about the many times this sort of thing has happened to me. In addition, I complained to Amazon asking that they never use Canada Post. I have no problems with any other delivery service they use, despite the fact that I now live in a 3rd floor walk-up. So today, an important and needed package apparently was brought to my home at 9:20 am. Three of us were sitting in the living room - no buzzer! I just checked online again and found out that delivery is imminent at the local postal outlet. That means that in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, I, a senior, have to take a bus to go to the local drugstore and pick up this package. Thank you very much Canada Post and I have two words I would like to say to you: one begins with an F. I can tell you that, given a chance, I will never use your services and I will broadcast the news of your incompetence as far and wide as I am able!"
"Canada Post never gives a damn about keeping your packages safe and undamaged.

I order a lot of products online, and through any other shipping provider, I've never had any issues with packages arriving damaged. But, if it's an item that has to pass through Canada Post at any point, it almost ALWAYS arrives crushed, dented, or otherwise horrifically damaged. A lot of the time, the damage is so absurd, I feel like a rogue, malicious employee is doing it intentionally.

Honestly getting really sick and tired of it."
"Garbage organization that serves virtually no purpose anymore but to keep the people that work for it employed.

It seems Canada Post wants a monopoly in courier service without providing the actual service. The ""letter"" carriers that come to my door are expected to deliver packages as well. In spite of the fact that they are able-bodied and this is the job they signed up for they leave half assed notifications in my mail box for me to go downtown to the post office to pick up packages I have ordered. Even though the package is entirely manageable. I never have this problem with Fedex, or UPS, or Puralator. They do the job they are paid to do.

These snowflakes basically get paid to stuff your mailbox full of junk mail. Sparing no undeserved sense of accomplishment and indignation along the way. They whine about a sciff of snow on the walk-way or refuse to deliver to your house altogether. On a good week when they haven't decided to stick their hand out and go on strike for more money they are still incredibly inconsistent. At no point have they ever delivered mail to my house all five days out of the week. Even when I was expecting something.

Never a smile or a greeting.

Yet these people get all the bells and whistles of a government job.

They get paid whether they decide to show up or not, and they will use any excuse not to. Now of course it's COVID-19. Despite the fact that in the town I live in no cases have broken out so far and all the stores remain open. Stores where the employees work in close quarters and are far more vulnerable than Canada Post employees.

Like the people who have commented before me I too am waiting on a package that I may never see. Money that I may never get back. All because the snowflake that was supposed to deliver it decided this was a good opportunity scrap his 12 hour work week and kick his feet up. He's getting paid for it anyway."
"I sent out a tracked pkg via chit chat express in vancouver (great rates esp for US and Int'l; also a bit cheaper for Cdn shipments too) on mar 7 where it arrived along with 100+ others at their Pickering ON location. They made the usual call to Cda post to pick up the 100+ bag of pkgs. Cda Post sent out their contracted driver (bonded I hope) to pick up this bag. The only scan that shows is from the driver on 3/16 but that's where it ends. It's now Apr 1st & tracking doesn't show it arrived at the Mississauga depot as then it would say 'item processed' Mississauga ON. Chit Chat has even sent them video surveillance showing the pick up so it's out of their hands. I mean the tracking clearly means their Cda Post's driver was there & scanned that he picked them up 3/16 'Shipment picked up by Canada Post Mississauga, ON'
So I open a ticket on 3/26 specifically asking the assigned to call me but no they email me stating it's possible the recipient rec'd the pkg without a scan during this pandemic; highly unlikely when 100+ other pkgs are missing too. So I'm wondering what is taking them so long to simply ask the contracted driver where the bag with 100+ shipments went that day that were scanned to be dropped off at the Mississauga depot? Apparently Cda Post is trying to deny that bag was picked up even tho it clearly shows they did! I will do whatever it takes to reach out to the top so this is just the beginning as I now have a claim against me from the recipient for $325.41 plus 2 lost items and the postage I paid. I also see bad reviews on an indeed.com post as I was googling this location to find out how to contact someone at the top; so I'm not surprised they are ignoring the mysterious disappearance of 100+ pkgs. This is unacceptable Cda Post; over 100 pkgs lost in la la land? Get with it. No wonder you are losing customers."
Canada post is a trash government paid for service. They do least amount of work as possible. They should close this garbage down and let the private businesses run it properly. This is one of the worst run government businesses. Absolutely a disgrace. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Horrendous service and lazy work with terrible customer service.
"I decided to get my package delivered to my door due to the virus scare. Unfortunately for me, the delivery man did not even come up to my door with the parcel, he put a delivery notice in my mailbox and basically ran away. My father went out and tried to get his attention by waving and yelling, but he was completely ignored. My father then watched him give two other houses a delivery notice before driving off. So I waited on the phone for an hour for a customer service representative, only for her to tell me he didn't drop it off because the packaging around the video game I ordered was potentially too big. I had to wait until the next day to pick it up, only to find that the parcel could have easily fit in my mailbox. I'm scared of catching the virus and endangering my father, so the last thing I wanted to do was stand in a a lineup at the post office. And trying to find an answer on the Canada Post website in impossible, I spent hours trying to get some sort of help or at least file a complaint."
I payed $79 for a mail to Colombia. It took 20 days to arrive there and I am still waiting for the delivery.
"I've had a similar experience. I am waiting on an expedited package to be delivered. It was scanned on Friday March 27th at 7:31am as ""Out for Delivery"". It is now Tuesday the 31st. It still says out for delivery. I called Canada post and put in a service ticket. I went to the post office. They have no idea where it is. No one can even help. They just don't know. Complete fail by Canada post. UPS on the ball it seems.."
"Parcel scheduled for delivery for March 24, its March 30 still not here. Today it was listed ""Out for Delivery"" then shortly after that was cancelled saying delivery tomorrow. Day after day they just don't deliver. Canada Post is such an unreliable service, I wish there was an option to pay Canada Post $1000 a year to just forward my mail to Fedex, Purolator or any other reliable courier. Even though I'm sure they'd still find a way to screw things up."
"Absolutley disgusting service. I ordered a game from best buy 10 days ago. Best buy promised me it would arrive on Tuesday March 24. Then I log onto their terrible tracking service and it says that it will arrive on Thursday. This is when I started to get angry. But fine I waited. Then Thursday came around. Waited entire day and didnt come. It was already 3 days late at this point. Then waited all day Friday and didnt come.At this point I was extremley angry as my game was promised to be here on Tuesday. Not only that but our entire neighborhood got NO mail service on Friday even though we are supposed to every day. Now I had to wait the entire weekend. After this ridiculous service, we called Canada Post. Waiter and hour and half for them to answer and thry were of NO HELP. The lady said they dont know where it is but should arrive on Monday. Not very helpful at all. She filed a ticket for us in the event package doesnt arrive, they will pay us for the money we lost. How dare they!!! They cant just pay off losing my package!!! As of Monday now past 4:30 pm, still no sign of my package and the neighborhood still hasnt received mail. Wow shocker! Canada post has never delivered on time. Next time, I will use fedex, ups, or purolator. Forget this useless company (who I have a feeling lost my package and doesnt even care)."
"What a joke. I've had multiple bad experiences with Canada Post but every time hope that it was just a ""one-time"" or 3-5 time thing.. I've finally had it. Why not try having actual people on the other end of the customer service conversation. I do not want to talk to a robot just for them to tell me things I could have easily searched myself. If there is an issue with a recipients address, I should not have to send 2 hours of my day trying to figure out why you can't do your job and contact me. Why else do you have my email and phone number? Additionally, if I have purchased from the same company with the same address before, what has changed between October and now that you can't verify my address anymore? My package will now be sent back across the country where I will have to fight to cancel the whole order. All you could do is ""try and add a note to the file to 'try' and notify the delivery office in time. No promises."" What a joke. Meanwhile I have a separate order likely on the same truck that won't be able to delivered because of my address and you can't do anything about adding a note to that file until it's scanned as no good. What good is that? As soon as it gets that scan it will be sent back to the sender. Broken system. Horrible communication and policies. I should have learned this by now. Will not sending/receiving through Canada Post anymore. More work than it's worth. Argue with me that my address is incorrect even though it's the address that my mail from the Municipality (who clearly knows my correct address) come on. When I finally give up the fight and use your recommended one you STILL can't get it right."
"By far the worst delivery service in the country. I live in a laneway house in Vancouver and Canada post refuses to deliver to any laneway houses. Why? The management says that their employees are cowards that are afraid of imaginary and non-existent dangers. I have had a couple of supervisors over to my house and they couldn't point out any dangers. They would just run away saying its our policy and would refuse to discuss or explain it. Exercise your freedom of speech and write ""Canada Post Sucks"" on your mailbox."
"‚ÄúAttempted delivery ‚Äúwithout notice card!! It‚Äôs ridiculous my tiny little package can‚Äôt safe drop, it‚Äôs a tiny children book can completely fit the mailbox. It‚Äôs likely the person didn‚Äôt come at all. The whole family were at home whole day and we have camera around the house. Don‚Äôt forget Lots of people not working currently the person should really try.,,,,, very hard to do the ‚Äú Attempted‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù delivery, I wonder if the person is really doing his/her job. Very disappointed at the service especially at this time nobody wants to go out. Canada post should really do something to avoid it happen!! Doesn‚Äôt help at all during this crisis to help social distancing because they push us to go out!! Terrible!"
"They delivered the package, but for some reason marked it as delivered Friday afternoon and delivered Monday afternoon. They really should not do this sort of thing. This is unfortunate because in the past I always thought that they were good. Customer service on phone was ok, they tried to help me."
I was expecting a delivery and stayed home all day to receive it. Then received a notice of attempted delivery. The person clearly made no attempt since I was home and I don't have a way of carrying the package from the pickup location to my home. I was told nothing can be done. Terrible service.
"First off, their customer service phone line is sooo terrible you can barely distinguish their voices at all it just cuts in and out like they are talking to you in an elevator. I have no issues hearing any other company/person on the phone so I know its not on my end. And trying to get into an online chat with them is an entire ordeal on its own, having to fill out a service ticket and enter all this random info instead of letting you speak with someone if your question does not correlate to one of their service ticket options.
Now onto the real issue - I had a parcel that was marked as delivered online but I did not receive it. After literal days of trying to find out what happened to it and having a service ticket opened and all, I get a call from a number with 'NO ID' (so you cant phone them back probably) and a lady tells me that even though my address was originally entered correctly, at some point my postal code was changed by them seemingly for zero reason. She had no explanation for this other than that it was weird and she doesn't know what happened. Because of this it was delivered to a different city. And thats it. They don't hold themselves responsible AT ALL, even to tell the company that sent it that they screwed up or anything. So I had to contact the seller and tell them how Canada Post lost my package and wont fix their mistake.
Complete joke of a company and unbelievably useless when trying to get information from them."
"Literally the worst delivery service ever. I would pay Canada Post a yearly premium to pass off any of my mail or parcels to FedEx or Purolator for delivery as they are 10 time more reliable. Canada Post tracking website is always so slow to be updated. I currently have a parcel that the tracking shows its guaranteed delivery on March 24. It's currently the 27 and I still don't have the parcel. Other than that they constantly deliver my mail to my neighbor on the next street that has the same street number as me but a different street name. Every week or two my neighbor and I meet up to exchange the mail that the constantly deliver to the wrong addresses, BRUTAL SERVICE..."
WORST DELIVERY SERVICES EVER. MY PACKAGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED ON MARCH 25TH BUT IT'S 27TH NOW AND THEY SEND IT TO ANOTHER CITY. THE WORST IS THERE'S NO SIMILAR ADDRESS AS MINE IN THAT CITY !
"One thing that really pisses me off about Canada post is that it will never track your package 100% there‚Äôs always some bs, my package yesterday left at 5:30 am from a place that is only 4 hours away and it‚Äôs been over 30 hours and still not even an update I know it‚Äôs at the post office , just the workers there are brainless when it comes to anything ,and also I messaged them about it and that to has been 20 some hours ago so customer service 0/10 if I could give 0 stars on this review I would as well, thank you for listening to my review"
"Brutal government agency, not surprised though. Have had two items in the last 6 months lost or stolen by the delivery driver. Both have said delivered (ping pong table and a MacBook) and never received. Will never use these clowns again and I don‚Äôt know why companies use them ie, Best Buy."
"I owed a third party some money. they only claimed to accept money orders so I sent them the money order. The third party claimed they never received it months later and I received an email from my insurance company telling me if I don't pay it in 14 days then they will pay it and my rates will go up. So I called Canada post to track my money order and sure enough it was cashed out 13 days after I sent it. I asked for a verification email of the money order being cashed out. I was told I'd get it emailed in one day. Called back the next day. Got a different guy who said it takes five business days and to call back in 5 business days if I didn't get it. Called back 5 business days(Today) At this point I now have seven days left to send the money or else my insurance company is going to pay it and my rates go up. Sure enough, a new employee and she claims neither of the two employees requested an email verification for me. She said she'll send it and escalate it because I've already been waiting so long. Wow."
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. They are the most incompetent company around. I never get my packages on time, the delivery people are surly and won't accommodate sh!t. They leave delivery notice cards, even though I'm home and could easily receive my package and now, I'm forced to go outside even though I'm trying to social distance. I try to NEVER use Canada Post but there are times that Amazon would use them for delivery. I get really mad when I see that as I know for sure I won't get it in the time Amazon promised me. I needed something for a particular day and it was literally a week late because Canada Post delivered it. I've already made a complaint to Amazon and have asked them not to use Canada Post. They really need to take a look at how business is done by USPS. I have used USPS and have always been satisfied. Things are delivered within the States in 2 days! I've never had a lost package and things run much more smoothly. Canada Post is an embarrassment to Canada. Trudeau himself said we need to stay home so that we reduce the risk of spreading the virus and Canada Post isn't doing anything to help mitigate that. Their customer service is an absolute joke. What a waste of money, after waiting 30 minutes just to hear somebody tell me in person what I can see on the website. Why do these people have jobs? Can't we get rid of these people and improve the service so that less people rely on the customer service? It makes sense to me."
"They tell you not to go out and stay home. I ordered a package and paid for delivery and the post man is telling me to go to the post office and pick it up. I'm standing in front of him, he's holding my package and I have to go to the post office and pick it up tomorrow. So now I have to go out and hope not to catch a deadly virus"
Worst service .. ordered but they never deliver it on time and at door always ask to go for pick up in store even during dangerous Coronavirus time too... I hate Canada post
"Outstanding Service... I received my camera today morning which I ordered from S World Electronics. You did really amazing work and delivered camera to me on Time, even I can say before time. That's really wonderful. Thank you Canada Post and S World Electronics too."
"Canada post is a joke, gotta get there s**t together"
"I understand we have to be careful these days with covid19 but last week Canada post sent out an email explaining how there service will be suffering at these times no guarantee of on time delivery and so on,,,,,

What's funny about this is that's basically the same way Canada post is when there is no virus problem

I've had every problem you can imagine with Canada post
They are the most expensive postal service in the world and they certainly under deliver"
My packages never show up on time. Seems to only be Canada Post that has this problem.
"Delivered my medicine to a adress that didnt even exist then. Customer service is avis trash to the point where I said Canada post sucks and he said ""well I'm not part of canada post"" you cant even say a single swear not even at the customer service person and they hang up on you litteraly said ""so you guys messed up and now I'm f**ked for my pain."" Then apologized for swearing and he still hung up there little babys...why even have a customer service if I pre much have to figure out everything myself and that there app litteraly says exactly what they say to me they need to be trained better or let go"
Worst service ever cant even give me an answer on where or when I will get my pkg. Why even have customer service reps when they just tell you exactly what the app says. All the staff are useless and cant help anyone use any other delivery service!!!! If I could rate 0 stars I would
DO NOT USE Canada Post!!!! i had my parcel stolen by the driver in Creemore Ontario. They never gave me back any money for a claim when I had 100 claim insurance on the parcel. went thru the chain of command of their customer service. They are an absolute JOKE!!! Fukn Crooks!!!! They robbed me
Why??????????
"I specifically ordered online to practice social distancing and not having to go to a store. Canada Post did not bother to deliver my order. They just put a slip in our community mailbox that I could pick up the package at Shoppers the next day. I was home at the time the mail person put the slip in our mailbox. This totally defeats the purpose of my online ordering.
Very disappointed by this, and unnecessarily putting me and others at risk."
Canada Post is a joke. Every time I see Canada Post is the carrier it gives me anxiety because of all the trouble I've gone through with this pathetic company. As usual they messed up again. Tracking tells me it's out for delivery but the agent on the line tells me it's not out for delivery and all of this on a Friday.
First off it should have another star before number 1 for pathetic just about every Friday the mail bag never shows up on my road and then when I have mail to Go Out the thing never shows and this is the Third Time that my mail doesn't get picked up to go out and I'm fed up with their laziness in that place at Pass Lake post office and they are a Real Joke all they do is smoke pot On The Job Diliverering Mail So all the pot smokers should really apply for a job with Canada post since they allow their drivers to smoke pot while doing the mail route What A Joke With Them
"I ordered something from HP. Canada Post shipped it from Mississauga to Woodstock first via London then through Chatham. Both way further west of Woodstock. So on Friday I am working at home all morning waiting for my package when I get an email saying that an attempt was made to deliver my package at 8 that morning and that a slip was left. Since I am at the front of the house I know that no attempt was made and when I checked outside, sure enough, no slip was left.
This isn't the first time this has happened and not just to me. It is just in Woodstock that the employees are so pathetic and lazy or is this common in other municipalities? And trying to call their contact number, after 15 attempts I gave up, and trying to navigate their website to lodge a complaint is like navigating a labyrinth blindfolded in the dark; just kept going in circles with their useless links.
I want to order other things through HP, but not while they use Canada Post as their delivery service."
I absolutely hate canada post. Such an abysmal service. They did not even bother delivering my package. They did not even come to our place to attempt delivery. This is totally unfair. I have been on the phone for 30 mins just to lodge a complaint to them. The whole time I am just on hold. I HATE CANADA POST!!!!!
"Terrible Service!!!
Canada post will not deliver to the door! The business that was doing the shipping has indicated and under the impression it was. You have to pick it up at their local pick up depot. Due to the present situation, they are putting not only their employee at the depot at risk but also the public. Use Purolator, FedEx, etc.. they will ship to door! Again given the present situation, Canada Post is not providing adequate measures in place!"
"Are you guys not delivering parcels anymore, instead, just leave a Notice to pick up from a far away post office site? What a dumb delivery guys who do not even buzz the unit number and come to the 5th floor to deliver in person! I work from home and have been here every second of the day at home. If you do not intend to execute your delivery services to people, it is best that you get privatized in order to delight your customers! This is not the first time this has happened. If i rate below 1, i dare to give you a minus 10. For agents who are so lazy to deliver to us, you have to get lay off at once. Many deserving people need jobs now!"
"I have had only one negative experience and it was just because a package got switched from someone else's box into mine and mine to theirs. I have had great service so far with Canada Post, they have been extremely reliable. My delivery worker goes out of his way to make sure my mail gets delivered. I'd rather Canada Post than any other courier."
I can‚Äôt believe this - I‚Äôm self-isolating and am home 24/7. I ordered a number of vital products from amazon and the only ones that failed to deliver were Canada post. Not a note or message - they didn‚Äôt even consider dropping off the products on the doorstep. I understand these are crazy uncertain times - but the products I ordered were necessary items that I was ‚Äúguaranteed delivery‚Äù on - shame on you Canada post - now I have to go outside of isolation and risk
How the hell can a simple job such as delivering mail be so complicated. It has taken 3 days for my parcel to be sent 54 mins in the wrong direction. I honestly hope Canada Post becomes nonexistent. It is not worth it. Government would be better off contracting it as long as the treasury board was ignored. What a waste.
"Why the the hell does my package get sent to saskatoon when it was shipped from white rock to go to abbotsford? When I called for more info I was told nothing helpful after waiting on hold for half an hour just repeated what the website already showed. Was told I'd have to wait a week just to get any sort of information, this entire company is a joke."
"Just terrible.
Can‚Äôt say enough about how bad CP is. They fight to survive against email and private companies like fedex and ups. Maybe if it were to be privatized it would run the way a company should."
"CP failed to deliver my passport last month.
We knew it was coming and when my wife heard car door slamming outside she looked and saw CP van leaving.
went to check mailbox and there was nothing!
no note left on a door either.
next day i went to the post office and they gave me the envelope.
NO EXPLANATION OFFERED what so ever!
My daughter picks up her baby's medicine from a pharmacy on 108 Av.
the address is straight forward: building number and a street number. one storey building with two businesses.
Guess what?
TWICE CP failed to deliver much needed medicine explaining ""couldn't find it""
And once they delivered it to the wrong address and claimed person signed for it. yeah, wrong person though.
given the lowest possible rating and NO improvements I think we shouldn't be surprised since it's OWNED BY OUR CORRUPTED GOVERNMENT!
Time to get rid of those crooks!"
"Do not use at all cost. Lets get this company to shut down and let UPS, purolator or other reliable companies take over instead. Boycott Canada Post now!

What is the point of having your package delivered when you have to go to shoppers to pick it up all the time?? No attempts whatsover, just leaves a ticket. I am never using Canada post again!"
so awful and so sneaky. just avoid at all costs
they always leave a left card whether you are at home or not......
"Every experience I've had with Canada post has been terrible. If I could control what shipping service vendors used, I would intentionally never pick Canada post. From the time I was almost run over by their driver while walking down a sidewalk, to just trying to get my package delivered. The one that pushed me over the line to write this review today is that I was home all day yesterday, due to the quarantines imposed by the gov. because of covid-19. Instead of leaving my package at my door, or even trying to ring it, they left a notice in my mailbox telling me to go pick it up from some sorting center. So instead of having no contact (safest), now I have to go somewhere that will put both me and whoever is working at risk, or else they're going to send my package back. I contacted them for assistance (even just hold my package a bit longer) and they will do absolutely nothing to help. You can eat turds Canada post."
"Has it‚Äôs goods, has its bads, generally a positive opinion of it, I‚Äôve only had small parcels With cheap items go lost, though I have family members whose expensive items were lost in transit Somehow..."
"I stayed home all day today because I was expecting a very important package, the guy came in my building and left a delivery note. He did NOT knock on my door, he did NOT use the buzzer, he did NOT leave it in front of my door. It's the FOURTH TIME this happened. I tried complaining several times. When I explained this to the girl at my nearest Canada post office, she said ""I don't know what to tell you"", The lady on the helpline said, the guy couldnt bring the delivery van in front of your building, but guess what, the package was as small as the delivery note, why wouldn't he deliver the package instead. Today I called to file a complaint, they said the guy tried reaching but I wasn't home, but I freakin skipped work and stayed home ALL DAY so that I wouldn't miss this package but all they have to do is leave the delivery note. What's the point of this delivery service when EVERYTIME I have to physically pickup the package from their locations. There other company INTELCOM does a much better job. They use the buzzer, knock on the door etc. I wish I could find a way to select the Amazon delivery service myself. I'd always pick anything but Canadapost. Very disappointed."
The Canadian Post is like a blackhole for packages. I've been waiting over a month for a package that normally takes 3 business days.
"I sent a large check to my bank in the USA using Canada Post Express mail with tracking, signature and delivery confirmation. It cost $28.00 just to mail the standard business envelope, and was supposed to be there in 5 days. Over a week later, online tracking shows that it is on hold somewhere and that they are ""confirming the address""- yet the mailimg address is the PO Box # given to me by the bank itself. Online support will not allow me to file a ticket, saying that it is an unsupported product. What is that supposed to mean?! This was a timely matter involving major funds. I do NOT recommend Canada Post as a delivery service. Next time I mail anything, it will be through UPS or FedEx, if possible."
Wish their was a zero star post but their delivery service makes the company look bad you take a day off work to receive your package only to find out the mail person dont show up and a slip in your mailbox like you weren't home dont depend on these ppl to deliver your package they lazy and they are under the union so nothing wont change just sad.
"I have never in my 27 years of living, received a single package to my home by Canada Post.

Half the time they say they ""left a card"" in the tracking, there is nothing in my mailbox and I go to pick it up myself and over a WEEK later, I'll randomly get the slip for that package saying they ""tried to deliver it"" and I, thinking it's another package, go to the post office half an hour each way only to find out that I picked that package up a week ago.

Why are we paying for shipping and then having to pay gas and time to get it ourselves. If I wanted to buy it at a store, I WOULD BUY IT AT A BLOODY STORE.

What bloody jungle did they pull these monkeys out of to produce such a negative experience?

Stop lying and saying you are a postal service. Stop wasting time, and resources delivering ""attempted delivery"" slips and just phone or email people that their package is at the post office because they have to go there anyway to get their package."
"My experience with Canada post is a very bad one. I support Canada post,
by not participating in e billing. i believe Canada post provides jobs.
That said i purchased an I Phone to be sent to my daughter in Brisbane Australia as surprise gift. I place the I phone box in a larger box with extra wrap for protection. I proceeded to go to the Shoppers , where Canada post has a outlet. The woman,(wearing a Canada Post shirt) assisted me. I told her it was a I phone going to Australia. She asked if I wanted it Insure, to which I replied yes. we insured it for $1000.00 dollars. She asked if I wanted it returned to me at my expense, if for some reason it did not arrive to my daughter.
Which I replied yes, of course. She informed me of its arrival date.
All of this information was clearly indicated on the outside of the package. I paid my charge, and walked away with my bill and tracking number. Three days later I check the tracking only to discover that the package was being returned to""sender"" at my expense as it was an UNMAILABLE item. I did not know what that could mean so i research this. Because the iPhone has a lithium battery it can not go into the cargo hold of a plane. This surprised me as i frequently travel with my I phone and computer. Apparently I phones can be sent by ground transportation, but not air. Well I say to myself at least it is being sent back to me. Two days later a mail delivery person rings my door bell to explain why the I phone is being return, but she is not going to charge me to receive it back . Apparently a discussion at their post office felt this was unfair as I should never have been able to mail it in the first place. It was the responsibility of first post office person to know this. Again it was clearly marked on the package that this was a I phone. All this is bad enough but when I opened the returned package the phone was not there! They returned an empty package!
Now was it STOLEN? Unmailable items which are not returned are, porn, guns, ammunition, insects, animals, some chemicals etc.
I feel this is outrageous. The phone arrived to them by ground and should have been returned by ground to me. this would have never happened if the post office did their job right in the first place.
I call the 1 800 number and spoked to two people, one a supervisor, with no outcome. One tells me i can't claim the insurance as it was an unmailable item! i received a service ticket number with a reference number and a date of resolve 2020/06/02. This is very poor customer service. I guess my final thought is, if your own employees don't know the rules why am I expected to know them? This should be the responsiblity of Canada post. And if Canada post has thieves in their
employ they should be released of their duties.

I was most disappointed by service rendered at Canada post service terminal at 383 Heritage Dr SE. The lady officer who served me was utmost rude and racist. My visitor I had visiting from Australia has had a very bad taste of Canada because of this incident. I am prepared to come forward and help you root out such undesirable elements in your institution. The branch manager came and watched helplessly as this woman agent kept on ranting for no reason.
"Canada Post expedited delivery handed over medical records to the wrong address several blocks away on a different street. A complete stranger kindly brought the sensitive information to my door. Filed complaint number one. Local Superintendent was supposed to call - never did - closed the service ticket though. This led to complaint number two - against the local depot Superintendent. Now I have two formal complaints going. Sitting here on hold talking to yet another call center agent to try to get this dealt with at some point. The new persons just told me that the entire complaint needs to be under one service ticket, contrary to what the previous call center agent said. On and on ad nauseum ... I have contempt for Canada Post management at this point and I don't see that changing soon ...Gut the whole system and start over ... they are clearly incompetent ... A few days later .... I got a call from the local supervisors. They say they never got the phone message from their colleague (a Resolution Specialist) and that is why they didn't contact me until several days later (after I filed complaint number two) ... who knows what happened ? We seem to have worked out an agreement .... finally ... meanwhile, I'm still expecting a call from the Resolution Specialist in a few days ... he left the phone message that never got a reply so he is going up the chain of command apparently ...what a circus ... lack of communication between call centers, inconsistent advice, left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, senior mgt. apparently has their head stuck somewhere avoiding the whole mess,.... on and on and on..... Canada Post needs a complete organizational overhaul ... some real accountability would be helpful too ..."
I ordered a product it was late by 2 days and there was a little problem with the adress... I the reciver or the sender where not notified in time to resolve the issue till the package was returned to the sender now I'm stuck paying shipping again seems un fair to both parties
"Ordered many items from Amazon within the last 2 weeks, all orders shipped with Purolator, Intelcom and another were all received with no issues, 3 orders were shipped via Canada Post NOT 1 WAS RECEIVED!!! I work from home, I am always home lol the only way I found out an attempted delivery was done was my Amazon app that sent me a notification. I contacted Canada Post right away asking why he did not even ring the bell, they explained if the package is larger then my mailbox they do not ring they simply put a slip in the mailbox showing where the package can be picked up. I was not only upset that they lied to the merchant saying ATTEMPTED DELIVERY (as if it was my fault I missed the delivery) but they are making a decision that is not theirs to make. When a merchant request a home delivery it means home, not Pharmaprix! I have contacted Amazon and complained about the first order not delivered and that in no way I was going to go pick up a 40lbs box at the depot, they resent my package with Purolator, I received it the next day with no issues! for the other 2 orders, I called Amazon and advised them of the problem with Canada Post, and that if they look in my account they will see I was home because I signed for 2 deliveries with Purolator at around the same time the mailman said ATTEMPTED DELIVERY again, they apologized and asked if I wish to downgrade Canada Post from my shipping options and right away said yes. Canada Post will now be the last option and Amazon assured me that my future order will be shipped via other companies!
Canada Post needs to either start doing their job or advise their clients (merchants) that they actually do not deliver to the home. It is false advertising, be clear with them saying if it does not fit in the mailbox we do not deliver! Stop lying to your merchants saying you attempted delivery, and yes I said lying if you DO NOT ring the doorbell no one will answer, so NO you did not try to deliver, stop lying to everyone to make yourself look good. You are not doing what you are paid for!!! Tell the merchants prior to accepting the packages that you do not deliver at home and if they choose to continue using you, they can deal with the clients' complaints.
Never mind strikes or pressure tactics, concentrate on your workmanship and responsibilities to the clients and then maybe people would be interested in working with you!"
"I swear this delivery person watched me leave my house to drop everyone off this morning and then when I got back, notice saying I couldn't get my package until tomorrow. It has my shipment of medical marijuana FOR MY DYING MOM and they refused to help me until ""tomorrow at 3"". Don't use canada post. They don't care about you."
"First and last time doing business with them people . My package was supposed to be delivered two days ago and they cant even tell you where the fck your package is. Terrible service not recommended
They suck"
"The most terrible part about Canada Post is if you make an error on shipping information, they will not help you

Every other company will allow you to hold the package at a facility, while you provide proper documentation that you placed the order(Id)

I hate Canada Post, I wish companies would refuse to ship with them. They are HUGE time waster"
1 star it's too much for canada post service. My mail forwarding service was cancelled before it even started and then when it started they only delivered selected mail and the rest was LOST!!!! aka I was told they did not know where it went. Ridiculous!!!! No apologies and blamed me for not calling in sooner. Time to go paperless
"I ordered some cd from Germany . 2 days from Germany to Canada registered German Post . Just 2 days from being shipped to arrive in Canada , excellent service by German Post . But that is where it ends . As soon as it arrives in Canada , tracking is no more . Now it is somewhere and not sure where . 5 days since it arrived in Canada and not received . If i do not get them , i will take them to court . I do not need to insure my package against their negligence and theft , they need to insure themselves , same as car insurance . Canada post needs to be sold , union crushed and all the marxist unionized scum fired . Worst service in the world and more expensive than anywhere else ."
"It's the worst post ever, they never attempt to deliver things I order even if Im home and keep them in their facilities, I wish I could sue the company or something, bunch of useless pieces of crap!"
I order an item and it was suppose to be delivered by Canada post. I was home and no one came to my house. Online tracking page says they were unable to deliver the parcel that's crap because they never came to my home. They never left a notice card at all. Canada Post needs to get a clue or close their doors.
I have yet to have a pleasant experience with Canada Post after ordering anything online. Never comes in the time frame initially told which starts to get beyond frustrating. I will never use them again unless I actually have to and don't have another option. If I do get another option I will take it any day of the week over these guys......someone needs to fix this awful problem of a company.
They're one of the worst delivery companies ever. They truly suck and I'm tired at people partnering with them.
"Sent item by Xpresspost with tracking and insurance.
Item arrived damaged.
Canada post won't pay for the loss.
I'll try not to use Canada post in the future."
Ordered something using Canada post. Wasn‚Äôt home to sign for it so they left a note. Went to the post office they indicated on the slip and the lady scanned the slip and she says they don‚Äôt have it in stock. I call Canada post and they tell me the item was damaged on it way to being dropped at the post office and is now on its way to be destroyed. So they waste my time by going to the post office never indicated in the delivery update that it‚Äôs gone. On top of all this I had to call the seller to get my money back and it takes up to 21 days for them to confirm with Canada post that my package will be destroyed. I never even got my package and lost the money I paid for shipping like how is Canada post even in business. Canada post is the worst shipping service available and anytime I use their service it‚Äôs a problem always!!!
"Canada post makes the mail process a nightmare. If you have a community mailbox, there is often no attempt at parcel delivery, and delivery notices are poorly filled out. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to track down a package when they don't indicate what post office to pick it up at- that is, if they haven‚Äôt put your mail in a neighbour‚Äôs community mail box out of carelessness. London, Ontario, is the worst city I have lived in for mail delivery. The local manager has been helpful but I have often been forced to plan my entire day around the vague notion that a package will arrive if I hope to track it down within the next month after attempted delivery. Really, truly, I am at my wits‚Äô end."
"They are very sneaky. I get the out for delivery message,later I get a message telling me they left a notice but no notice was left. Three hours later my mailman leaves the notice. They save tons of money faking delivery and making people go get their parcels at the poste office . I‚Äôve made complaints and it‚Äôs still happening."
"Buying a 3 days guarantee service? Here how it works
Dropped Friday 2 PM. Employee told me it was too late to be shipped that day. OK Fair enough. So leaving Monday should be there Wednesday? NO, because Monday is shipping day and therefore is not included in the 3 days delivery. Thus delivered guarantee for Thursday, that is 6 day after dropping date. And guess what now it‚Äôs Friday and hasn‚Äôt arrived yet and after checking tracking number it appears it wont be delivered before Monday, so 10 days later and paid 20$ for express delivery.This is the second time in less than a month. And Windsor-Kelowna are not in the boonies..."
"Twice this week, the parcel delivery person just stuck a notification in my door and left. They didn't knock on the door and they didn't leave the package. I asked the woman downstairs if she heard any knocking and she didn't hear anything either.
Why are the companies paying for door to door delivery for if they refuse to actually deliver parcels. If I want a notification, I can get it texted or emailed to me."
Never have a received the xpresspost package on time that I have ordered. Somehow there is alwaysss a mix up or a re-route ex. Which really is awful considering i have never had 1 issue in 2 years with purolator. Come back to canada post once and they screw it up again. first try.
"Driver is incompetent, every time there is a parcel with a required signature he fails to deliver the parcel to the shipping department (side of building instead of main entrance both clearly marked) even when indicated to do so on the shipping note."
"If I could go lower, I would. Every delivery I wait for is always hampered with problems. My last delivery using xpresspost had it delayed by a week with tracking saying it was unable to deliver. Now my current package had no tracking for 2 days and now that the tracking has been back, the only update was from the day it got processed when the item first shipped. What's the point of me paying for xpresspost if the tracking isn't accurate and I'm not going to receive my package in 2 business days? This might be on me for expecting them to not screw it up again but I guess that's too much to ask. At my previous address in an apartment, they wouldn't even deliver to my box and just leave a note to pickup every time. Now living in a house, I just don't receive it on time anymore. I'm sick of using this garbage service but some businesses don't provide other alternatives so fk me I guess.

Update on my recent package: somehow tracking finally returned after a whole week of no updates and turns out it's not even in the right city. As expected the expected delivery date is still unavailable on tracking. Last two updates have been in cities that are hours away. They literally can't even send the package to the right facility, I can't believe I keep paying for xpresspost when I don't get proper tracking and it doesn't even come close to 2 business days."
"I drove down to the Canada post Office here in Moose Jaw ,Saskatchewan to mail a parcel . I paid the postage and they put a label on the package . It came back insufficient postage !! I could have made that mistake but I should not have been punished for their mistake . My parcel will be late . The reason I went to the post office in the first place was to ensure the correct postage was on it ."
"I pay for express shipping, delivery to my HOME - 2 day service. I work from home - so I'm ALWAYS home.

Today the delivery person rings the bell and rather than wait a minute for me to answer so they can do their job and deliver my freaking package, they just leave a slip at the door telling me to go to my local post office to pick it up in person.

Canada Post is supposed to be a parcel delivery service... no-one is paying them to deliver paper slips telling us to pick up our stuff in person when they have our package in their truck at our home, but refuse to wait 1 minute for people to get to the door and answer.

Canada Post is basically burning money paying these people to drive all over the city with parcels, pretend to make an effort to deliver it (by leaving a slip at the door as if you weren't home), and then dropping off their truck-load of parcels at the local pick-up location for customers to drive over and get their parcels themselves.

I'm guessing management is to blame for this because Canada Post service used to be fantastic - they'd actually wait for you to answer the door (i.e. rather than ring the bell, drop off the slip, and race back to their vehicle so fast that you don't have time to answer the door before they've left.)

It doesn't matter what individual person is delivering my packages... it's been the same problem for years. I think it's highly unlikely that every single one of those delivery people are lazy... more likely management is pressuring them to deliver too much in too little time so they're forced to provide lousy service.

I've learned that I literally have to be able to get to the door within about 5 seconds... god forbid I take 30 seconds because if I do, the delivery person will be long gone. This is unreasonable. What do the elderly do if they can't literally RUN to the door? It's fricking ridiculous. I'm a YOUNG, healthy person and even I can't run to the door fast enough to get my parcel delivery most of the time... so anyone who's not young and fast is screwed.

Canada Post - if you want to survive, you need to fix this. Otherwise you'll be driven out of business by companies like UPS who actually wait at your door for the minute it takes you to get there and answer it."
"I was refused service, called names, yelled at, then my reaction was filmed to cover the behind of the owner of the place so he could explain why he had refused me service. CP manager told me it ""didn't look good for me"". Why? Because the male owner of the place expects to be smiled at and kowtowed to by myself, a female customer. This is David cho at the London life post office in montreal. He and the organization who back him are a disgrace. I am also not the only person to have been abused, of course, by this man but that is the society we live in."
"If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable company for express post, use any company except canada post. I had ordered a 700$ Quite urgent package on a Thursday. It got Shipped express post Signature rehires, and out for delivery the following day. The Name and number was on there but the unit number was not. If one were to get to the building the fact the unit number was not present would NOT make a difference. The directory has my name on it which someone with to half a brain would be able to figure it out. Instead, Canada post decides to stop the shipment EMAIL me to update the info. So I did, same day of notification. I‚Äôve attempted Several chats and called x3 and no one can help. The info was updated right away and they still say if could take up to a week IF THE EMPLOYEE FIXES IT. Or it goes back to the sender. I‚Äôm not able to go pick it up myself cause it‚Äôs at a depot.. What‚Äôs going on Canada post? You guys are truly the most useless mailing system canada could ask for"
"ugly services I will never use it again for important documents, it is just for delivering rubbish"
"over priced, under performing. slow. and Miserable. I'm so tired of paying top dollar for a service that barely works. I cant count the amount of times i have ordered something, paid the extra price of xpresspost, and still had my stuff come much later then it should. I could drive from my house across the country and back, before you can get a package delivered to me. its pathetic for what we are charged."
"I had shipped my parcel to my partners in Markham like I always do weekly but in this instance the courier never attempted the delivery, left no slip and had my guys waiting all day for the parcel and even worse the item was sent back to the sorting building! Because it got sent to the sorting building it was a week delayed and my customer was furious because we couldn't repair his laptop and even worse they had declined my claim for a late delivery refund! They had claimed it was a bad weather which played no role in this delivery and even the second attempt wasn't updated on the attempted delivery status, are there Baboon's working for Canada Post???"
"Honestly - my package has been waiting for the address to be verified for 7 days now... I can‚Äôt get in contact with anyone and no agents are ever available.
Would never recommend them"
How the hell does it take a package 3 days to travel 4 fkin hours please someone explain it
"Delivery Service is SLOW!!!! Unbelievable! If there‚Äôs a delivery alert, how come there‚Äôs now one remind/give helpful suggestions to customers when they confused or no idea about the updating information for destination delivery. Especially some customers choose XExpress and pay a lot money for expected delivery (supposed for 8 days shipping process) till one day customers wait, check, worried, find out the reason by themselves, then feel upset, disappoint and complain upset experience to ppl around as well as Canada post service? ... does Canada post hire professional Trained and knowledgable employees? does Canada post has a professional standard delivery service? Does Canada post try to cheat customer which ppl pay xExpress and expected FAST/SAFETY delivery service??? Of counter persons doesn‚Äôt recognize the updating delivery information, I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôs the customer service job duties? Wait till ppl complain then open a file, creat a case#, make notice at computer system,DON? It‚Äôs shamed to tell everyone it is CANADA üá®üá¶‚Äôs post service!!! It‚Äôs a kinda cheating system since the top department till each location office service! I‚Äôm not complain for one of employees there! I‚Äôm complain to top department employees who earn a lot everyday but doesn‚Äôt work as they suppose expected for..."
"They don't bother using the buzzer, they just enter the building and knock. It's an ineffective and risky system if you ask me, leading to situations like missing packages. Hard to hear someone knocking when I'm in my room or in the washroom. I can't be always near the door at all times you know. Better to use a safe shipping address like a drop-off point or the post office.
I never missed deliveries from other service providers that actually made use of the buzzer, but this knocking the door one isn't good.
Of course, I checked everywhere for the sticker, or the package. Nothing. ""Delivery guy said he has delivered it to you"". Well, how come I don't have it?

Minus 4 stars because I did't receive my package worth a substantial amount of money, has to wait 1 month from now for a refund, wasted $ on the shipping, has nothing to use, the frustration, wasted time, and emotional distress.

So to CanPost: please use the buzzer, don't trust anyone from the hallway, and train your personnel. Because I have some packages still en route and I don't want a repeat of that horror. CONFIRM THE RECEIVER'S IDENTITY. Ask for ID's if you have to."
"XPress Post is absolutely an incredibly unreliable service if sending an envelope to the USA. The counter agent misleads you when they advise it may take 1 - 3 days. After 6 days my envelope has still not been delivered. It was a letter to Florida NOT South America or Asia. BETTER TO INVEST IN ANY OTHER COURIER! Next time I'll spend a few more $$ and send it with FedEx, UPS, DHL or Purolator. IF THEY KNOW IT MAY TAKE SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER THEY SHOULD TELL YOU THIS UPFRONT."
"Super garbage. Expensive, show"
"I am too lazy to write a lot... I hate UPS, Purolator and especially FedEx... problems, problems, problems... When i order something online, I am happy when i see that package will be delivered by Canada Post"
"I sent my packege on january 13 and they lost my original documets which costs 7000$ canadian dollar i keep calling the customer service every day , i didnt make mistake they just pretend they are looking and give priorities finally on february 29 they told me they did investigation and they couldn't find the packege and can you immagine they told me to give me 300$ canadian dollar compensation for the lost of 7000$ canadian dollar , they lost my time too they put pressure on my head i couldnt replace the documents unless i should have to pay 7000$ can , so dont trust this mail please its better to submit via personally regardless how long it takes to reach where you wanna submit your documents ."
"Surprisingly one of the most reliable shipping companies I've ever had the pleasure of working with. None of my packages have gone missing, and they all arrive in one piece thankfully. My posties are always extremely friendly and are happy to bring my parcels up to my apartment. Quite happy."
"Only during the last month, Canada Post lost 3 of my packages from abroad. One package from the US is shown to have entered Canada on January 30, 2020. One month later there is no sign of it. Two other packages from the UK, which only three years ago would have taken no more than 2 weeks to arrive, now they are not here in 6 weeks. Moreover, the month before, a package paid in the UK to arrive tracked and signed in 5-8 business days, arrived 5 weeks later. The tracking service showed clearly that the package was at the border in 3 days, all the rest, 22 business days in total, were needed to move it through Canada. They didn't even care to deliver it at the door as they were supposed to, and they forced us to drive 15km to the nearest post office to pick it up. This all happened between January 22 and February 28!!. I will not go with the story further back. Beyond horrible service!! If you call and file a complaint, they say they will get back to you next week, but they don't! It's not even about being a state-owned company! Communist Romania had much, much better mail services! It's beyond comprehension that in a country like Canada a public company can get away with this level of service!!"
"If I can give minus , my review will be minus -10 , never come back , very very bad"
"Rarely if ever have a late delivery with Purolator or UPS to name a couple, however consistently terrible experiences with Canada Post. Frustrating too when packages are scanned as arriving at their local office and it still takes 3 plus days to deliver them 5 km from their location. Have went to the Post Office for help and was willing to pick up the parcels only to get a who cares/ so what uncaring attitude conveying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get it when we get to it‚Äù. At times there are weather issues, which are understandable, however Canada Post employees exploit this beyond any reasonable level and do not put in any effort to efficiently clearing the backlog. There is an overwhelming sense of arrogance and belligerence that has developed and allowed to flourish like a cancer throughout an over-unionized culture of entitlement and complacency which has infiltrated and brain washed the organization‚Äôs workforce. The Canadian Government should stop wasting it‚Äôs citizen‚Äôs tax money and time; and shut this down opting for privatization. Giving an ‚Äúover rated‚Äù 1 star rating because there is no 0 star option and will never again place an order with a seller who chooses Canada Post to deliver."
"lost my packages multiple times now, ruined our weekend and birthday gifts multiple times, the person delivering never rings at the door even if we're home and/or somehow gets the address wrong and then it takes forever to receive the packages because they lost it, they clearly don't care"
Weather is a now a reason not to do a mandated job. How is snow a safety concern when delivering mail. A delivery date should be followed even if it‚Äôs snowing. Ice I understand. But snow. Come on. Overpaid under working butt holes.
"By far the worst shipping services in Canada!!!! I just had a surgery on my back and I am ordering my new home furniture online just because I can't go out of home to buy them. I live in a condo and my buzzer is listed but they NEVER call or buzz!!!! they just come and leave a note doesn't matter you are home or not!!! ALL THEY DO IS LEAVING A BLOODY NOTE!!!! once I saw the guy and ran after him to get my package but he ran away to his truck and drove away!!
I wish amazon stop using canada post for delivery! they deserve -5 starts! but you know what?!! they don't care cause they are government and who can tell government to do a better job!!!
I JUST HATE CANADA POST!"
"Zero star would be better, spend hours on the phone trying to get reimbursed for them messing up the package information (I was like ok well take the blame even if we didn‚Äôt fill it up) real problem is that when I asked for specification on the customs said there would be no problem and it definitely wasn‚Äôt the case and got stuck at customs abroad. Their answer, not our responsibility to tell you what the procedures are in the country of arrival, ok fair enough but if we ask you a question answer it or say you don‚Äôt know not the ‚Äúwell it will be fine and then not take responsibility for it‚Äù. There is a lack of communication, bad services and just plain lack of leadership. I would prefer talking to bell than them quite honestly."
"Worst service EVER! I wish they close down so the stores in Canada choose to post using other companies.

This has happened zillion times with me that it shows expected delivery for a date and the item is not delivered 10 days after that.

When you complain, they open a case and that is it. No action is taken. No update is provided to you on that for days."
"Please shut this service down!
Tired of the overpaid, underworked union snobs getting their way. Strikes twice a year, no delivery on weekends, careless drivers who mishandle packages or deliver late, unorganized depot workers who constantly lose packages or sort incorrectly, and all I get is a ""sorry"". Everytime they deliver a package theres an issue, never with purolater, UPS or dynamex do i have problems. I have told Amazon to not deliver my packages with them anymore, and more people should do the same. They have a 1 star rating for a reason, complete garbage service."
"absolutely awful delivery service. takes abysmally long and charge you extra for your package at the door whenever they choose, IF IT SHOWS UP. whenever they don‚Äôt feel like knocking they just sneakily put a sticker on your door that probably will never fully come off just to tell you that you missed your package and you can pay for it at your closest pickup point THE NEXT DAY."
"I wish Amazon Canada would offer more 2 day shipping options other than Canada Post. Anytime I place an order and Canada Post is the carrier the order is late, misplaced or lost. This is our hard earned tax dollars at work paying for these overpaid lazy morons. I also wish I could rate these clowns less than one star, more like -5 stars."
"If you order from amazon and the delivery service for the item you're purchasing chooses canada post, do yourself a favour and cancel the order because it will most likely be delivered late. Happens every time for me. When you call them to inquire about the issue they will offer no explanation as to why its late and you will be left angry and confused. They wont offer an solutions and you will be even more upset to find out your package is ‚Äúin transit‚Äù at a facility in your very own city but they will not allow you to have access to it, even when you offer to pick it up in person yourself. In addition you will not be compensated for your loss. Just a huge disappointment... We planned a weekend of ice fishing and now we have no tent to keep us warm and we already rented the auger and took days off and now we have to go out and buy a tent and wait for our pkg to come a week late so that we can send it back for a refund which will take two more days. Wow. Absolutely useless service"
Just the worst ! This company makes no sense
"The facts related to my most recent experience with Canada Post are as follows:

- A package was shipped to me from Toronto, destined for Ottawa.
- I received an electronic confirmation from Canada Post that my package would be delivered on (Friday) Feb. 21st, 2020, on Feb. 19th.
- When I went to the Post Office to pick up my item at the PO Box on Feb. 21st, I was told that there was a 'Revised date' - of Feb. 24th - for the item. 'Revised date'?
- I have a client who is waiting for me to use the documents that were included in the package that was shipped to me ... and the information that would be included in them.
- I called the Canada Post Customer Service line - at 1.800.267.1177 - to ask if I may pick up the item at the Ottawa depot. Their answer was 'No'.
- Their depot is open only until 12 Noon. Really? 12 Noon? Which professional business organization has depots that close at noon? The normal business day - for most working taxpayers - ends at 1700.
- As if to add insult to injury, a Customer Service representative - with badge No. 64705, located in New Brunswick - placed me on hold to further discuss the matter with his supervisor. After being treated to a 1 min. loop of recycled music for no less than 15 mins., my call was re-routed and I was re-directed to a recorded message to provide feedback on the Customer Service I had received. Really? Are they kidding? In the end, I wasted close to 30 mins. of my daily schedule trying to retrieve my package from Canada Post - unsuccessfully.

Added to this; I frequently end up re-delivering mail to neighbors that's delivered in error to my Super Mailbox. Canada Post seems unable to deliver mail with any level of consistent accuracy.

Overall, the service offered by Canada Post is less than acceptable for a Crown corporation; for any type of corporation, actually ... publicly or privately -funded. Some might summarize it with the use of stronger words.

I rated Canada Post a '1' - simply because '0' was not an available choice.

Canada Post must do better!"
"Canada Post says 2 days for delivery within a city. My friend is less than a 20 minute drive from my house (both in Toronto) and received a piece of mail I sent 2 and a half weeks later!!

Notional delivery is supposed to be 4 days and my mother in Nova Scotia received a piece of mail after 2 weeks and the the date stamp on the letter was one week after I had mailed it.

What is happening here! There are no delayed service notices. This is a joke. If that is how long mail takes at least update your information so we can know what to expect!!"
Canada Post is a complete joke you send a parcel expedited from Hamilton to Toronto.its.supposed to be there the next day and somehow they NEVER deliver it in one day always takes 2-3 days how can they charge more for overnight shipping yet it takes them 2-3 days to deliver it folks dont use Canada Post use purolator who ACTUALLY delivers next day when you send it express
"The Canada Post staff of located at Rexall,545 Steeles Ave W Unit A01, Brampton, ON L6Y 4E7. This happened after me receiving a note (17feb2020) from the driver of Canada Post saying that I'd have to collect the package from above mentioned address, so dropped by to collect my package on 18feb but the lady on the counter after checking my ID(passport), confirmed that the parcel wasn't there at the office as their driver hadn't dropped it, so was asked to collect it the next day, so went by back on 20th feb, but the lady after checking my passport informed me that my passport wasn't a valid ID as it didnt have the residential address on it! (Yeah of course my passport dint have residential address) but unfortunately had moved to Brampton just a week before so dint have any ID with residential proof on it, after me trying to explain my situation and furthermore explaining the fact that they could verify my name on the package or other ID(Ontario driver license, which had my old address), so asked if I could speak to the manager on shift and after explaining the situation the manager asked me to leave and added that she could not bend the rules for people like me ( this the word she used ""you people"") as she noticed from my passport that I was from a different nationality,
The fact is I lost my package and realized how unruly the staff was and one human is reluctant to help out an other, so I decided to never avail Canada Post service henceforth."
Went from bad to pathetic service...wow been using these clowns for 10 years only because there isnt a more affordable international shipping service. Please jeff bezos take over shipping in canada !
ABSOLUTE TRASH COMPANY! I‚Äôve lost so many parcels due to them being too lazy to look up my P.O BOX for my address! This postal service offers no help and everyone there is no help what so ever! I hope this company goes down soon! Worthless company!
"ordered a package from the states. took the package no time to come to Canada. Then it switched to Canada post. Tried to sign up for notifications, well that didnt work. Checked online and saw shipment was to be shipped out today, but also saw that apparently i requested for the package to be put on hold.... Except i didn't, So today the post office guy came rang the doorbell and left a note saying to pick up my package... Which couldve been solved by idk just dropping the package off!! If you could come to my place to deliver a message you could drop the package off!!! Worthless company...."
"They emailed me that I wasn't home for delivery and I was !! They said they left a pick up note and they didn't!!!
Worst postal service ever."
"Not surprised Canada post has over 90% 1 star ratings. Can‚Äôt even deliver a package properly, let alone on time and Undamaged. Going with other couriers from now on whenever possible. I don‚Äôt even care if it costs me triple!"
"this is disaster the Xpresspost should be in the destination in 2 business days that's almost two weeks not received by receiver or returned to the sender I talked with supervisor they were polite but none of them solved my problem I paid more than $18 for service.
I think if you trust canada post you are doing mistake"
"Supervisor Brent Barker: 1 Star (only because I had to give one in order to review)
Customer Service Rep at the Tillsonburg branch: 5 Stars

I had an issue with an expected delivery so I called my local Canada Post office and spoke with the customer service rep who informed me it was still out for delivery but found it odd, that a delivery attempt was not made by that time. She then attempted to contact the driver via text, but was not able to. I then called back spoke with another customer service rep who offered for me to speak to a supervisor. I said yes and was put on the phone with the supervisor on duty at the Tillsonburg branch Brent Barker, who then informed me very rudely that their drivers have up until 8 PM, to deliver packages???? (I find this very hard to believe). I then asked to speak with his manager, who he claimed was standing right next to him. He then placed me on hold after 2 to 3 minutes I realized he had no intention of putting me on the phone with his manager and hung up.
I attempted to call back several times, but he would not answer, so I left a message for a manager to call me back‚Ä¶ No manager ever called me back. I have never been treated so rudely by a supervisor in my life!!! I am completely offended and absolutely disgusted by the treatment I received from the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù Brent Barker. I then called spoke with the customer service rep and asked if she was able to contact the driver to find out when an attempt would be made because according to Brent Barker the delivery drivers deliver up until 8 PM. She then informed me that all delivery drivers had gone home. This was that 4:13 p.m. so clearly Brent Barker completely misinformed me and their drivers don‚Äôt deliver packages until 8 PM otherwise drivers would still be on the road.
Thanks to a stellar customer service representative at the Tillsonburg branch, I was able to pick up my package tonight rather than the next business day after 1 PM. The supervisor Brent Barker, however, should attend several customer service seminars and learn how to properly speak to customers‚Ä¶ and of course inform them correctly."
"If Canada Post has screwed you, let the business know they have a choice to use another delivery service! Here is a letter that I have sent/emailed to businesses that currently use Canada Post and I have had 4 businesses thank me for the feedback and have changed their carrier! Please feel free to use adapt it to your experience and let the businesses know that using this awful company is affecting any repeat business from you!

Attention ""Company"" Important information on your current shipping method

I believe this is very important information for your expanding online shopping business. I live British Columbia and a 15 min drive from a major mall so don't live in the boondocks. I find myself buying most of my items online as I like the convenience of shopping from home. Shipping charges are the cost of convenience but What you need to know if you use Canada Post to ship my order, they will happily charge their high parcel fees and extort you if you need expediated or faster service, but what they won't tell you is that they will not actually deliver to me but instead simply drop if off at a Shoppers Drugmart location that suits them. To make matters even worse, it's not even the closest one to where I live.

Having just ordered several items for Christmas and a few just recently, and incurring the inconvenience of going out of my way to pick up parcels and being told that no one was home when attempted delivery which is why I had to pick up was the excuse at Christmas (complete lie as you will see below) this time I finally called to complain. The response from Canada Post was that they wouldn‚Äôt ever actually deliver to me because I was outside of their delivery area!

Here is why this is important to you.

I live .4 miles from the community mailbox and Canada Post Claims their policy is to not deliver further than .5 KM from the community mailbox. This policy is in place for all areas of Canada and with all new subdivisions now utilizing community mailboxes for the past decade or so, much of the money you spend shipping is not benefiting your customers at all! Meanwhile UPS, FedEx, DHL, Purolator and other companies deliver to the actual address on the package, as one would expect, plus shipping charges are often less than Canada Post.

So if you find that your online business is not growing as fast as you like, you may want to take a closer look at your shipping policies and follow up with your customers to see if they were happy with how it was delivered. Because you currently use Canada Post to deliver your parcels, I for one will not shop online with you anymore as there is no point because I am forced to pick up in a location that is farther than actually driving to your store! I will purchase from another business that uses another shipper (so I actually get the packages delivered) and this may be the case with many of your other customers!"
"I live in a basement suit. Heard someone come in upstairs as I live right under the front door I can hear everyone who comes in. Didint hear anyone come downstairs where my appartment is, so I figured it was just one of the other residents. Nope was a canada post imployee leaving me a we missed you slip without even trying to walk to the door. Walked to canada post to hopefully pick it up. But nope they haven't brought it back. Now I wont be able to get it for another 3 days. Because i work. Thanks for leaving me without meds Canada post"
This is honestly the worst delivery service I have experienced.Please don‚Äôt ever try to use Canada post for any important documents.You will regret it
Don't waste your time and money. It's not worthy. I paid 92.00 dollars for a priority service (3 days) and 4 days later than the planned arrival date wasn't at the destination.
Seriously the worst courier service i had ever seen the person who is reading this please don‚Äôt use this service the only thing they say is ( sorry we can‚Äôt do anything you have to wait)
"I mailed a parcel to my daughter in Ontario 25 Jan 20, delivery supposed to be 3 Feb; I insured it, have a tracking number. 29 Jan it left Montreal; today is 17 Feb and it's missing. I have a service ticket number now. I was told I can get my money refunded. This is totally UNACCEPTABLE! We put our trust in Canada Post to keep our mail safe, and to deliver it. Where is the parcel? I spoke with the person whom I mailed it through and was advised that this is happening quite often. Obviously there's a thief, or thieves working for Canada Post..where else, or what else could have happened to my parcel, otherwise it would have been delivered. I will not be using Canada Post again, I have lost confidence in them. Amazon delivers on time, and I've had no issues with them...Walmart too. Good bye Canada Post. Your service is expensive, and it sucks!"
2 days late now and finally today my parcel updated to the out for delivery status at 8:34am and after waiting around all day for the 3rd day in a row at 5:47pm the status of my parcel updates to rescheduled for delivery on next business day. It left Halifax at 5:45 Monday morning and I only live about an hour and a half drive away so I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding why it would take a total of 6 days to be delivered.
"I recently moved to Ottawa and it has been a nightmare experience dealing with Canada Post. They said they would reroute my packages to a new address at the homeless shelter where I was staying at but they did not and they still went to the old address in Ottawa. And they admitted they made a mistake and started rerouting them to a postal facility where I pick some of them up. Then I got my new address and I'm getting packages not delivered even though they say they're being delivered, but then they show up two or three weeks later. I don't know what the heck is going on there, but it is pretty terrible, and I don't even want to send mail or receive mail anymore."
"They are not bad, they are worst than bad. The main problem is that from top to bottom, all they care is the paycheck that they get. They are outright selfish..."
"Nothing but bad things to say about Canada Post. Almost all my parcels go missing, get misdirected or the drivers are too lazy to do their job and leave a card hanging on my door handle. They make little attempt to do their jobs or notify customers of missing or misdirected items. It must say in their system that items are long overdue for delivery so not sure why they don't attempt to contact customers about delays."
"Something seems fishy with Canada Post -- I had placed an order for two trackable items six weeks ago that were due for delivery January the 6th. Ticket numbers got open and closed without resolution claiming that the parcels could never be located. I have no regrets toward giving those damn buggers an earful because they couldn't do a damn thing about it... The fact they got scanned for delivery and for both go missing all at the same time means that it's possible that one of the postal workers helped themselves to the parcels seeing that those were $35.00 worth of comics books once put in the vehicle and left. The Black Friday/holiday rush -- that's when things can get crazy. Meanwhile, I got back my money from the vendors and reordered them elsewhere from some comic book online vendors that happen to be within Canada. I pray that I don't fall victim again with Canada Posts' shennanagans, especially...this time these aren't trackable including a Batman comic book I bid on eBay coming from the United States like the previous parcels that went missing. Here are the tracking numbers of the lost parcels as evidence:
LX683084753US
LX593931827US"
they didn't deliver my package and didn't return it to my house and I had to pay again for the return
"Spent $300 to ship a snowboard to Japan with ""guaranteed"" delivery on Feb 10th. A week after shipping, and 2 days after it was supposed to have arrived (feb 12th) the package was still in Montreal. When I asked for it to be returned to me, they said they couldn't because it was still scheduled for shipping to Japan. After it left canada, a new message said it was in Japan, but now they couldn't find it. But not to worry, they'd get back to me within 60 days to let me know if they had any updates. And they wonder why Fed Ex etc are putting them out of business."
Always on time. Only have problems with other companies.
"Package was scanned to my city and the next day at 8am the package was scanned to be return to shipper. I called literally an hour after that to see the issue and they said the address was incorrect. The address was in fact correct but i live in a new address. There was no phone call, email, or text attempting to clear the confusion. I asked for my package to be held and any canada post facility and they didnt even check. All they would do was recite their ‚Äòpolicy‚Äô. Wish i could give a negative review but i cant. Maybe this is why theyre going out of business. They need to be reported to BBB"
"Terrible terrible terrible.
But they are extremely worthy of their 1 star rating. Employees are to busy doing blow to care about the job they have to do yes I've actually witnessed this event. Pathetic"
"Worst carrier ever. Dam lazy unions. Instead of delivering my mail i know they have, they rather leave a dumb slip saying we tryed to deliver it."
"Would give negative stars if i could. After being delayed so long, they come to my door and instead of knocking so they can get my signature and give me my parcel they just stick a you missed us notice and go on their way. No responsibility, non professional, terrible service. Canada post wouldnt exist if there was even a slightly better postal service."
My first and most worse experience i ever have they says my item is delivered and i even did not get that i don't know where they deliver it. when i called to figure out they said we are not responsible. wow that was osm and i was speechless don't know what to do if they are not responsible then who. it us just carelessness they misplace my parcel now just making excuses tell me where do i contact. finally after calling on 8-10 different numbers one lady help me bit but do not think it works for me coz they tell me on which location my parcel is but she said they don't have. carzy
My Canada Post receipt says to enter 'canadapostsurvey.com'--THIS SITE HAS NOT BEEN UPGRADED SINCE 2014---You owe me $250.00. You defraud the Canadian People-scammers!
"mail thing cannot use parcel box right have box stuck in it for 2 days
if had a brain might be dangerous"
"I paid for the MAIL to be Temporarily sent to our other location for 3 months. It has been now 25 Days and we have only received 10 pieces of mail from that Location. When we normally get 10+ in 1 day.
I have called Canada post 3 times now to see what is going on. They keep opening a Ticket and closing it without coming to a conclusion as to why we have not received any mail. Why am I paying for a service if they are not providing the services I am paying for.??? The people at costumer serves said they will have to call me back with any information. I TRULY THINK THAT THE LEFT HAND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING. SAVE your money do not bother with CANADA POST. THEY JUST GIVE YOU THE RING AROUND. In any other kind of business, you pay for a service and you get it.
WHY DOES CANADA POST ALWAYS GET A PASS.??
I am now on day 25 I have called Canada Post every day and still no answer as to where my mail is. The supervisor still has not called me back from yesterday's conversation with him.
I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY MAIL. LOOKS LIKE I JUST THROUGH AWAY $300.00. How do I get A refund??"
"Overpriced and sh1t3. No seriously, how can they even defend the high prices when they are always late, never bother delivering to the door and just put one of those bull's sh1t3 ""woops we missed you"" notes, even when you're f0oking home, and then when you go to pick it up at the location stated, they f0king tell you that your package is not there yet and try again the next day. If I wanted to wait 2 f0oking weeks and pay 500$ for a package, I'd take a goddamn plane ticket or taxi and get the damn thing myself."
Terrible service terrible tracking says in transit for days.... now months wow terrible I know it‚Äôs Canada Post cause it says and not the first time I have had to pay for something they have ‚Äúlost‚Äù total bull crap üí©
"I don‚Äôt normally write any reviews at all but seriously the government improve post service. It‚Äôs very slow, inconvenient, and expensive. No wonder Amazon beats them easily."
"Canada post employees are so lazy, or stupid, or both.
Tracking numbers are completely useless because their employees do not scan the parcels when they arrive and leave the terminals.
You never know when they are going to show up, yet the lazy jerks keep their jobs because the so called managers are as bad as the employees.
They don't bother to show up half of the time."
"If I could give 0 stars I would, I orders stock for my small business from a supplier, thatbwent missing due to my over sized item being left on my step on a weekend when no one was home. No tracking number update... nothing. Over 500$ value. They admit they did wrong, but I got 138$ returned. Insulting and appalled by this. They only have insurance for 100$ but no option to secure my larger items with out dividing it and paying wayyyyyy more for shipping. Horrible system, horrible company, and even worse customer service. I waited 2 months for them to say too bad here is 20% of what we lost on u. Never again will I use your company unless there is NO other way.
Absolute ahit show, had 6 claim numbers 3 dead line extensions and so many excuses and bull crap apologies that I lost respect just off that, then to be given this pesky return. Guess you needed my money more then me. F**@ you Canada Post from claim #134014084."
Iv had 5 parcels sent to me in the last 5 months. FOUR of the five got lost. I only ended up getting one of them and then another one 3 months late after numerous calls. I ordered this product a month and a half ago. I had a ticket made cause it got lost. I called twice. I had a new one sent from the company. That one got stuck. I had a ticket made for that one. Nothing. The guy i talked to on the phone about this told me i couldnt be refunded even thought heir website says i can. I tried messaging someone on their facebook messanger about it and they read and ignored me twice. DONT BUY ANYTHING ONLINE IF U LIVE IN CANADA I GUESS...
worst service in the greatest conunty in the world lost my two important mail my T4 and a check took me for ever to get the copy of my T4 and the check the second time
"Canada Post lost my package, last scan was in Toronto Jan. 6th (I'm in Ottawa). Replacement package was sent by shipper, last scan was Jan.31st, also in Toronto. It is now Feb. 8th. It appears they lost the replacement package, too. A different shipment was sent from Montreal in mid-December, just arrived this week, it took 6 weeks! Their customer service is a joke and much like their tracking, seems to be exist purely for appearances. I wonder how many packages they ""lose"" a year? Maybe it's time for a government inquiry?"
"This so-called courier company is by far the weakest in Canada.
Avoid sending or receiving through this company.
I gave a star because I can not give 0 star.

TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT."
"What can I say that others haven't covered already?

You know the drill, Canada Post is a joke. I hate them. They literally ALWAYS deliver my packages later than they say they would.

I had a package sent from Whitby, Ontario to Georgetown, Ontario (45 mins away, MAX) on Sunday night. Picked up on Monday and tracking hasn't updated until TODAY, 5 days later. Now it says Monday Feb, 10th. At first it was Feb 6, then Feb 7, and now it's Feb 10.

Canada Post screws over THOUSANDS of people per day. Yet we still use them. I did just last night......"
"Whenever I hear the words Canada post and I start to have anxiety and cold sweats.
My experience with this cult is horrific.
Lying, and stealing, poor service PATHETIC.
I wish a billionaire come buy this company and fire everyone and start fresh.
Saying due to weather my expected delivery had change . How long are you gonna keep these lies up for ? The weather is fine, my parcel is right down the road in your facility. SMARTEN UP!!
I paid for faster shipping. The past 3 times the SAME thing happens.
My nerves cant take this anymore. I'm so stressed out with this experience. I cant sleep. I dont even want my parcels anymore. Keep it. I give up."
"Horrible. I'm so upset. I used to pay 13$ for small package to an other province in Canada, now over 20$ !!!!!!!!!!??????
Shipping service in US is around 3$.
Why Canada is that expensive.
I would never ever work with you"
"I really don't like Canada Post. I would recommend using any other postal / shipping service that is available to you before Canada Post.

There are a few reasons why I would say this, but first I'd like to clarify that not all of my experiences with Canada Post are negative. Most of the people at the Canada Post locations are pleasant and helpful and I know of one mail carrier that is excellent.

However, overall the service is unreliable, their tracking information sucks, and the Canada Post employees that aren't good, are very very bad.

We used to live in a triplex, and our front door was at the bottom of a small flight of stairs (5 steps). Our mail carrier would throw any mail or parcels down those stairs and take off. He disregarded our mailbox (at the top of the steps), he disregarded any damage that may be done to packages (or the door on one occasion), and if it was something we had to receive in person, he would not even knock or leave a delivery notice. We would have to find the tracking number and try to see if the package was ready for pickup, and most of the time the counter person would complain that we didn't have the little delivery notice that he was supposed to leave...

We brought the problem up with Canada Post a few times, and eventually we had a new mail carrier. We were happy that Canada Post took our problem seriously, but as It turns out the new mail carrier was almost as lazy as the first one. We no longer had flying mail and packages, but they still wouldn't knock or leave delivery notices.

We now live in a house in a rural community, and we are still having some problems.

Our mail carrier rarely comes down our
Driveway to knock on our door to see if we are home, instead they just automatically leave delivery notice in our mailbox. And if they believe that they can cram the parcel in our mailbox they gIve that a try...I swear it sometimes looks like they stomped the box to get it in there.

Another problem we have is that any time it snows the mail carrier will refuse to deliver at all. I have called to ask about it and the reason they gave me is that our mailbox and driveway are inaccessible and need to be cleared. Well that's a lie. I always clear our driveway and mailbox and maintain it for the duration of the storm. There is never an issue for any one else, including my wife in her super low VW Beetle, who can drive right up to the mailbox to check if it contains any mail (that's another thing, they never raise the flag). It's just a convenient excuse that they use because they are lazy.

In general any package that I receive by Canada post takes at least double the time of any other shipping company. They also have useless tracking information.

I will receive a shipping confirmation, and for a few days it will say ""item processed"", then maybe I get another ""item processed"" at my local Canada Post, but most of the time it changes to ""out for delivery"" and it gives me an expected delivery date of the same day. On average I have to wait another 3 days before I actually receive the package or a delivery slip in my mailbox.

In the past I have tried to bypass the mail carrier and go directly to the post office when I see that the item has reached the local post office, but they either don't want to help me at all, or the package actually never got there yet. I really don't understand how their tracking works.

I have switched to always using either FedEx, DHL, or UPS whenever possible. They are always on time or ahead of schedule! They also have the most friendly delivery people and tracking that is accurate."
"not even one stars. 0 f√ºcking stars.

i can‚Äôt imagine a more unreliable and over-priced postal service than canada-f√ºcking-post-dearest. you know something is wrong when its cheaper to send a package to florida than it is to send a package one province over.

another time, a tracked package from the u.s. was said to be delivered (it was small, so should have been locked in the community mailbox) but of course, it never showed up. an investigation was opened with usps (nothing good to say about them either), but they weren‚Äôt any help. and once i turned to cp, they‚Äôre all like ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do sh√Øt since you already spoke to usps‚Äù.

anyways.. end of rant. end of story. FIN! just wanted to add to this collection of hate (and rightfully so)."
Had to deliver a small package to Vancouver the other day and it went as well as you would expect. Paid for Xpresspost and the package was already in transit and successfully delivered the following morning.
"This is a very bad service.
They will not work with you and if you phone customer relations it just gets worse. If you can avoid this service I would!!! This service will go the way of the dodo. And it surprises me that there is no change in this day and age, totally outdated and service is horrible. It would be more reliable to send a horse and a messenger to deliver your mail!!"
"Some of the worst and most unreliable service I've ever had to deal with for parcels, both sending and receiving. Customer service is useless, as they never have any more information than you can track online. Not even sure why they have a customer service department. Prices keep rising and quality of service falling. With electronic billing and all the options for parcel shipping, Canada Post will be out of business soon. And deservedly so."
"Giving a 1 star because we have to give something, but even 1 is too much REALLY TOO MUCH!!!

Worse customer service EVER!!!

Wish I could recommend your services for my shop, but for my needs shipping in USA or other provinces than Quebec, Canada, I might just turn to another courier services who REALLY CARES for its clients.

It's fine to pay, but when a package is received damaged in the US, there is no more service at Canada Posts, but just a ping pong game that's starting...

Still waiting for my claim (ticket opened in December, 2019) for damaged delivery.

Thank you so much for your ""business"".

And do not tell me to call at 1-866-607-6301 or 1-800-267-1177, cause I already did more than ones and those people are useless...
I WANT A SUPERVISOR to talk too, but I guess there is none!!! Cause when I asked he or she was supposed to call me back 5 days ago!!!

WHAT TYPE OF SERVICE IS THAT?!?!"
"unfortunately I can not give them MINUS 5 starts.
I was expecting my passport to arrive on Feb 3rd, 2020.
Friday January 31 my wife heard a door slamming outside and
looking out the window saw a Canada Post van pulling out of out driveway.
She checked maibox but it was empty. No notice on a door either.
We thought he might return next day for some reason but he didn't.
Monday Feb 4th I went to post office to check just in case and EXPRESS envelope with my passport was there!
With no explanation what so ever potsman delivered EXPRESS mail to post office !
Same story happened to my friend but they had an excuse: ""some people were on property and mailman was afraid to get out of van ""
""some people"" were my friend's wife and his 3 y.o.
Well we can talk about ""canada post"" forever and once in the past we filed a formal complaint about their crappy work but no changes happened.
Hopefully everything will be in digital form soon and those high paid crooks will lose their jobs!"
"I had a package delivered to my address in Regina s4s-1X9, the mailman decided to jam this package into my mailbox which is an apartment mailbox made for letters. The package contained a DVD so when they put it in they bent and the cracked the case and ruined the DVD not smart."
"They don‚Äôt even receive a one star! I paid $72 for express international and they said it will be delivered in 1-3 business days. On the 3rd day my package was sent to MEXICO when it was supposed to mailed to the NETHERLANDS. On the tracking page it says my package has arrived to the country that I sent it to. But when I give them a call they say that‚Äôs the route it will take. These people are filthy, disgusting liars! Today is the 5th day and my package is still in Mexico. It has confidential documents in it and it did not arrive to the destination on time! I still don‚Äôt know if my package is lost because they‚Äôre not telling me anything. NEVER EVER USE CANADA POST."
This is the worst mailing system ever. They dont show any care to meet the service level agreement. Letter left Canada 1 month after mailed for 14 days service. This is unacceptable. They know how to spoil your important business.. They dont even have 1/2 star option which OS what I would rate them.... So disappointed....
"You are by far the shittest organization out there. You rank right up there with the CRA, useless pieces of crap. Nice thing though is I refuse to do business with any business that does business with you or Purolator."
Only reason they are around is because they are the only convenient place to ship. Overpriced and hurts small business owners.
"Paid for Xpress Post, was told it would be delivered the next day. They confirmed and typed in the address to have their scanner codes printed and stuck onto the package. Somehow there was still a problem and my package that was supposed to go from Toronto to WIndsor ended up in Barrie. Requested a refund of the $20+ I spent to get the package to family before they left for an entire month and they told me that they met their requirements and delivered as quickly as possible. I don't know how they can consider it delivered as quickly as possible when they sent it in the WRONG DIRECTION!"
"6 days to get a package from Montreal to Ottawa?!? Just because it makes all the sense in the world, they decided to route the package trough Val D'or, QC"
"I really hate having to write this, but CP is so bad and going downhill unfortunately. The location in the Rideau centre Ottawa is chronically understaffed and the line ups are always over 40min. They won‚Äôt drop at my place without a signature (who‚Äôs home during the day?) or leave at a neighbour‚Äôs who is home and could easily sign. They should have a separate parcel pick up line or lockers and get with the times given that parcel pick up is big and only growing. They are the worst of all the delivery services. Too bad they don‚Äôt care one tiny bit about customer service..."
"I ordered box spring from Amazon and it was going to deliver on 21th January but they failed to deliver it on time, they lost my parcel. Then, Amazon reordered my box spring and it was going to deliver on January 29th but again they didn‚Äôt deliver. Moreover I tried to contact many times but they did not provide me any effective resolution. They simply told me that you need to take from their station we will not deliver at home because the box is heavy, then what is the purpose of online order and delivery services? It is the worst experience that I have two times with canada post."
"Worst service! Please stay away if you have other options, don't waste your time. Lost two of my packages. Ordered items online that weights almost 10 lbs. expecting to have it delivered home, in our doorstep. Specifically because of the package weight instead they were delivered to the post office, that we need to pick up the package, well then what's the point of getting it couriered at home if we have to pick up a heavy package anyway."
"A very bad customer service specially on the phone!! Including that they have a technical problem with there phone and the voice is like you are talking to a robot!!
The employees in the offices are not trained and don‚Äôt knows there job!"
"Mail-Lady shoved the book that I ordered through the Screen-door and dropped it on cement, Instead of just opening the screen door/knocking/etc."
Waited all day for a package to not even be brought into my apt complex. Just the slip for my mailbox two floors below me. Waited at the top of the stairs figuring the delivery mutt would need to verify my apt and he ran off. Looked at me from across the parking lot waving him down and left instead of pulling back around. Stjohns NL
"I had an Xpresspost parcel delivered yesterday and was required to show my I.D. At my own house! I know a signature is required, but In the past, anyone at home can sign for the parcel. Has Canada Post changed their policy? This seemed to invade my privacy, and was very inconvenient. I‚Äôll be switching to Another carrier. I mailed a parcel the other day and noticed that a ‚Äúgas surcharge‚Äô is being charged and gas here in Calgary is only 95 cents! Rediculous! Canada needs a better postal system."
"As a small business owner, Canada Post is crippling us. Their rates are astronomically high. In comparison to other countries postal rates, A small tracked package mailed in 3- 10 business days, within Canada can run you up to $24, while our neighbours in the US can mail a small tracked package in 2-4 business days for a fraction of the cost $6. The product I sell averages $22, now my customers are left with no choice but to pay more in shipping than the product is worth. And who wants to do that. NO ONE.

This is on top of the many packages that go undelivered to my customers. Many times the packages just go missing or are marked as delivered but never show up at the address. And who is responsible for the the lost mail? ME. The small business owner.

Do better Canada Post.

Thank you for your poor customer service and making it extremely difficult to run a small business."
"Worst postal service I have ever had the displeasure of using. Paid extra to have Xpress post for them to send the package to the wrong city! Called them and they promised it would be delivered by Monday--- NOPE, called again Tuesday--- nope again.
Called again and asked them where the package was and they just told me the tracking information that I can see online myself. I explained it was for a small business and this could cost a lot of money, he didn't seem to care. I said I wanted to collect the package from wherever it is as it was urgent and they said I was not allowed due to the sorting office being closed to public. Couldn't even give me another number to call for someone with the information I needed. He then kept asking me if he could help me with anything else like he was just trying to get me off the phone!! HE DIDN'T HELP ME AT ALL! What is the point on a phone line if all the person can do is tell me what I already know and have no care to help me in any way!
Its time they pushed for this company to go private and get management that actually care about customer service and delivering packages that they are paid to.

They don't even try to deliver at the door they just leave a collection note in my community box, Why even bother using a postal service if you have to collect the package yourself! They are a constant disappointment.

Will never use or pay for this service again!"
Worst postal delivery service ever. Parcels are never on time always late. Called to inquire about a parcel I‚Äôve been waiting on now for over a week and they are telling me it‚Äôs going to be at least another week till it arrives. The parcel was due 2 weeks ago and I paid extra for express post and I still have to wait at least another week. What is the point to pay money for express post and not get it on time.
"Terrible experience. Sent a parcel to Ukraine on Jan 27 2019 from Red Deer, AB. It has been 31 days, and it is still not delivered, no trucking updates, I assume it is lost. The customer support sucks, they told me it needs to past 30 days to start an investigation, as 30days past that started saying it needed to past 45 days now. Charged me 100 bucks for the international delivery that is not delivered, not trackable and without the ability to investigate where it is. Never use this scam. Totally unprofessional and needs to be restructured from the top to the bottom."
"My experience was horrible. It took 3.5 minutes to get to a message telling me it would take me 10 minutes hold time before I could speak with a person.

The website is no better, I had to wade through six pages labelled phone contact before I found a phone number.

Waiting to listen to 5 different web options before I could make a phone selection. Honestly, why would I call if I wanted to look up the information on line, or want to chat?

The whole experience leads me to believe canada post does not want to help me with my need to deliver 5 packages. My experience was deplorable.

It took me 10 minutes to find out my medium sized boxes are too big for canada post to ship."
"Well Canada Post has dropped the ball once again.I did an online order from Ontario on the 13th of January has been stuck in Missisauga for past 2 weeks.This was sn EXPEDITED PARCEL.I contacted C.P. by phone and surprise phone conection was garbled and could barely hear the person at other end.I tried telling the person my issue and was disconnected and or hung up on.I then tried their online chat feature...guess what not available.The package finally arrived in my home City of Richmond B.C. and I think yeah finally...but what does C.P. do the send to their facility in North Vancouver B.C. 4 hrs later.I can't believe that their sofisticated scanning system would even allow it.Canada Post if your reading this your delivery service needs an overhaul from top to bottom..you staff is OVERPAID and UNDERWORKED. I say this because I have seen my neighbor who works for you, park his C.P. vehicle outside his home for up to 4 hrs before leaving to take it back to where ever.. Update parcel is now out for delivery in the WRONG!!! City.WOW JUST WOW!!! Canada Post get it together...Delivery is sure not what you should be doing.I am totally disgusted with your service."
"Sent my daughter's college application with registered mail on January 2. Deadline for application was January 17. Day after day, all i saw on my status was ...nothing! No updates, no movement, nothing. After countless phone calls to CP, stress, and headaches,I got a notification on January 18th it was only sent out of the country!! Yippe doo! It's January 25th, still no status updates that it has even arrived to the country's destination. (and still hoping her college will still accept her application.)

WARNING: Do not send anything important or time sensitive through Canada Post."
Community mailbox not accessed by canada post for three days. How do i know? There were no signs in the snow! How is it possible that 30 something households don't have mail for three to four days. Post office closed at 5 each day which is super handy if you work from 8.30 until 4. 30pm and commute and they have your mail at that office. Or they stuff a package in your mail slot and you cant get it out because the frame is smaller after they shut that bigger door. Worst thing is...for normal mail you cant chose an alternative. There is none thanks to monopolized position
"The worst service quality you can receive anywhere. It is a shame that such a company continues to be in business. One out of two packages is lost or delayed. Customer service reply to email enquiries repeating your inquiry without replies. When inquiring on the phone they do not have information other than what you provide them. The funniest thing is the recorded message asking if you want to take a survey after talking with the customer service. Most of the times the system is down and the survey does not come up. But when the system is up their representative does not hang up and after you wait for some time on the phone you end the call by your self and this way you cannot take the survey! Funny, no management no controls and lousy operation overall!"
"So mad at the lady that delivered my parcel today. complaining- nodding her head left and right- sighing and before she made me sign to accept my parcel OMG your dog. My dog is been barking since she knocked at my door. Can I help it, that is how my dog reacts. Does she wants me to do something bad to my dog to quite him Down??"
"To bad there was not an option to rate 0 stars. Today I received notification via email that my parcel had been delivered to the post office. The problem is that apparently said post office is half way across the country. I am in Saskatchewan and it was shown as delivered in Hamilton, ON! When I spoke to a CP representative on the phone she immediately blamed the company I had purchased from, not even entertaining the idea that the mighty Canada Post might make a mistake. In addition she could not, or would not, provide any additional information; such as the address on the package, or the post office it was supposedly delivered to. While I am entirely certain I will never hear from anyone at CP I want them to know they will be my LAST choice for package delivery in the future only to be used if there is absolutely no other choice. Looks like I am not alone based on the reviews of a couple thousand other reviewers."
"very bad service ever, I hade two bad experience with post-canada"
"Delivered my$200 package to the wrong house. Two days later they wouldn't leave my son's $25 package at the house but another Canada Post driver left his $100 at our door step (perfect). He had to drive to pick up the one package. I will be emailing Amazon and tell them never to use Canada Post ever again for our packages. Also when we talked to Canada Post, they Really Really don't give a crap."
Canada Post is a joke. Customer service is pathetic on a good day. There work skills are bottom of the barrel at best. In saying that UPS and FedEx aren‚Äôt much better. Your choices for your package deliver are Bad Crappy and The Worst! Intelcom in my experience is the best. Amazon. Why you think amazon fired FedEx as there primary shipper? Cause they suck! Jan 23/2020 again today my package didn‚Äôt arrive. Address verification is the excuse today. You think they would‚Äôve taken care of that yesterday when the excuse was package didn‚Äôt make the cutoff time. Now today your verifying the address. PATHETIC! Monkeys could do a better job than you people. Last 20 items I‚Äôve had to call and go through this BS 19 times. What is your problem at Canada post? Do any one of y‚Äôall have a IQ over 5? Do you wear helmets to work? You should cause your all gifted. Not in a good way ! R e t a r d s !
"I was sent a package over Christmas (from im guessing family since I have never received it) and it was sent to a post office in another end of the city. When I tried to get it actually delivered to a post office in my area of the city it took forever to get ahold of an actual person, when i finally did i was basically lied to, then after hours on the phone with representatives my results are it sucks to be me. Get your business together your a delivey service that wont deliver your package to the correct location and make it the customers problem then ultimately doing nothing and returning it to sender. Your cue card responses to all my questions we completely unhelpful and clearly made to keep things going in a circle of no where with no results. This has been the worst customer service and experience and shows your complete lack of care or concern for your business and its customers. Ill make sure to always use ups, fedex, or other competitors as much as i can. Thanks for absolutely nothing. I wonder what i got, would've been nice to have actually got it."
"Our local post is a joke.
Always late.
Never actually deliver anything but a parcel pickup.
Damaged many times.
Lost items ive sent.
And december they decided to open 2 packages. Cant prove it 100% but the old tape was peeled back and new tape that is different than the seller uses was over that. The canada post label was over the old tape and under the new tape. Seems obvious to me.
Ive had packages i was supposed to sign for that were left in the box. They paid extra to make sure i signed for it even.
Ive heard every excuse from its heavy to i cant see my truck from your door.
Its a contract is it not? Where do you get off taking a contract you have no intentions on fulfilling?"
I have a package coming from the USA to CAN i just checked my progress and its returning to sender without even notifying me that they couldn't complete the delivery. Not only that they didn't even bother leaving it at a location in my city for me to come pick it up just returning to sender so i can pay to ship it back to me again.
"Canada post service is really a shame for Canada especially In surrey , British Columbia. I had my exam yesterday , and i was waiting for my material, which was going to be delivered on January 15. I was continuously tracking my parcel, which reached Richmond, BC on 14 January. I called canada post costumer service also, and the lady on phone talked so rudely to me and said she can‚Äôt do anything. Can you believe, I received the parcel today after my exam. The delivery person was in such a hurry, he rang the bell and get back in his truck, it took me hardly 30 seconds to come down stairs to open the door. When i opened the door, he was about to leave my place. He saw me, stopped his truck and when i said that you should have waited for me for a minute. He said i have to deliver 150 packages more , and he doesn‚Äôt have time. I felt so disappointed, i had worst experience with canada post , really disappointed by their service and how these people are dealing with the public. Really had a very bad bad experience with Canada post."
"Such crap service. Takes a week to get a expadited package a week to get from Edmonton. Canada Post has the package Monday afternoon. Is in Calgary Tuesday morning. But gets delivered Friday afternoon????
They go on strike wanting better pay expecting everyone to stand behind them yet you get service like this."
"In order to talk to a supervisor at Canada Post you first must create a ticket with them and give them your personal information. I refused, and then when I finally got a supervisor 40 minutes later I asked her employee number and she said that was personal and couldn't give it to me, so I then asked why I had to give my personal info but she didn't.... no answer
So in order to speak to a supervisor at Canada Post your tracking number Canada post created is no good?"
Inordinate delays and lost packages: just another day for Canada Post.
I wish there was a no star option. They are beyond useless. Totally totally crap. Useless!!! I try never to use them but sometimes you have to - I always track the mail just to see how bad it gets - but they dont care - they have a monopoly - its time they were privatized
"it's terrible. and express delivery took more than one week, original plan is two days. don't use Canada Post if you have other options"
"Sooooooo sloooowwwww for delivery... They knock on your door and hope you are not there. How come it is only the Canada Post deliveries that never make it in time to my door? As a canadian citizen, that is a service I pay for and I would rather pay to all the other services than Canada post service. Feels like they simply do not care about fast delivery or at par service with other companies. I am sure there is a handful of great people working there but what a waste of those great people potential in that despicable service. I would shutdown this service, spare unuseful expenses from canadian and count on the alternative. They are kind of living on artificial respiratory device... Without canadian money to pay them, they would simply be out of business. Look at the review scores. I wish I would be proud of our mail system in Canada... But unfortunately, it is not the case. How can management sit on reviews like this ? So much unsatisfied customer!!! Are they living on the same planet as their customer? They really live in the canadian people money to survive and that is a shame!! I usually do not write lengthy review, but in this case, I felt I had to do it.

Sorry, that is my opinion."
"Canada Post should be the biggest shame of all Canadians!
Frequent lost of packages, delay after delay, extremely high shipping costs compared to UPS. They shattered my whole package's contents and only compensated me for the shipping cost. The most ridiculous one is they lost tens of thousands packages shipped from China in Oct. 2019. It is Jan. 17, 2020 today, and Canada Post is yet to find where are those packages, not at custom, not at anywhere, and mine is among these missing packages!
Shame on you Canada Post!"
Canada Post doesnt even warrant a single star. There isnt a proper rating here for them( if there was a negative star rating). I'm not going into detail..I'm just saying how it is...Canada Post is incompetent in every way PERIOD! There isnt enough words to describe how useless they are.
"Very poor delivery performance. It took 10 days fro a small package to come from Mississauga to Montreal. This package took only 5 days from Miami to Mississauga. I contacted Postes Canada and here are the replies:
1. They did not know where it was.between 5th and 14th Jan)
2. High volume, imagine Christmas !!!
3. Final story was that the package was delivered by USPS to an unexpected location.
Even with this Toronto - Montreal at 550 kM it can get in 10 days only if it walked at 2km /hr Even dog sleds can do better."
"Sent an important letter to an international address. have been tracking it for 17 days. Phoned today to find out that it has not even left my home town yet and is sitting in a bag in some office or other.
This is not the first time and I do not know why I decided to use Canada Post after the last three times that I have been disappointed with delivery times. One letter packet took 4 months to arrive last year. Also last year, I mailed two at the same time going to the same company in Ireland. One ended up in Ontario the other in Quebec and both sat in those regions for two weeks before they were shipped out and arrived at the destination on different days. In all these cases, I have had to phone the receivers to let them know that they may or may not receive the letters as Canada Post service is so poor.
You would think that after all these poor reviews they would do something about their service."
"If you can, avoid using Canada Post at all costs. Especially if you enjoy actually receiving your parcels. We have had absolutely nothing but issues with every single delivery. Things like putting it in the neighbours mailbox, crushed boxes, tracking says its been delivered or is out for delivery but it never shows up, they regularly
just leave slips for pick-up without even attempting the delivery then the parcel isn't available to be picked up for several days. Once a package is in their system as 'delivered' they claim there's nothing more they're able to do and you're SOL. It's also regular practice for them to change the delivery status to delivered even though it could still take up to 24 hours...if you're lucky enough to receive your package at all. Bottom of the barrel business standards, I'd be embarrassed to work there."
"I would give 0 to Canada Post for their customer service & systems & their terrible communication internally & equally their terrible liaising with external providers like customs. They only have tickets that are not correctly dealt with. I talked to 3 people re my complaint & the supervisor told me I cannot get a reply in writing due to them not wanting to help improve their systems to be beneficial to their customers. Just another corrupt & narcissistic system that only caters to shareholders & the lucrative salary & benefits of the CEO.
Would like Canada Post to move into a new decade of empathy rather than the apathy of the last decade."
"If I could give 0 stars I would.

These clowns are the worst of the worst. Parcels late or in bad condition.

Just placed an order over the weekend from Amazon and they chose Canada Post!! of course it never arrived on the guaranteed date and now apparently stuck/misplaced at the depot.

Clowns....typical government run crap service."
"They know they can't be fired. They have no service standards whatsoever.

The only purpose Canada Post serves in 2020 is a place for degenerate crackheads to work without fear of being fired.

It is essentially an expensive daycare for people with an IQ below 90."
"I have 2 Christmas letters that were never delivered to family members and 95% of our packages arive a day later then expected. Canada Post is a service that is literally taking money away from our hospitals and our schools, the least you could do is make the service TRUSTWORTHY."
"Where is the ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù option here?
Who else is tired of wasting their time going to a Canada Post office to pick up their packages that were supposed to be delivered in their homes instead?

Amazon has ONE big threat in Canada and it‚Äôs Canada Post!"
"Why do Canada post open my package, place the item in a new package and relabel it with a Canada post label. Especially when the package is an international package.. I have seen they done that to me so many times. Is this normal procedure? ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶"
Very bad customer service from the Canada post customer service office. They tried to delivery a parcel (not the regular mail man) and he took back the parcel stating that no access to the building. They are liars. I was in the office and waiting for this parcel. I was told by the customer service that some one will call me back no one did. Today I called back and the Supervisor name Dina called and she was super rude. This is not the service that we are expecting from Canada post. No wonder people dont wont to use Canada post any more.
"NOT RELIABLE. Package was meant to be delivered 6th of Jan. Still sitting at a facility in Montreal, QC. Who knows when it will be delivered...
DON'T USE CANADA POST"
"So, just an FYI to anyone who gets parcels delivered through Canada Post.

I had order a product online whiched claimed to say it would be delivered in 7 days. After 2 weeks, I claimed it as fraudulent through PayPal. After they investigated the situation, PayPal took the side of the sender, claiming it was a legit purchase. So, I waited almost 2 months.....
Seeing as I still received nothing I called PayPal and only to be informed by them that ""SUPPOSEDLY"" my package had already been delivered a month prior.....Which is completely hilarious because Canada Post claimed it was delivered....The best part is, it never was.... I have security cameras up because of crappy couriers.... And conveniently the package never made it to my door. I not sure what kind of shady losers Canada Post hires but clearly they stand by them. Now I'm out $100, and some theif Canada Post employee has my purchase. So, anyone that shops online. I suggest putting up cameras to make sure you get your items because under Canada Posts rules you only have 3 days after it was supposed to be delivered to make a claim if not good luck getting any money back! The best part is I had no idea when it was ""Supposedly"" delivered...
#CanadaPostSucks #ShadyDeliveries #Theives"
"If I could give a negative rating I would. Canada post wins hands down for the worst postal service in the world . 10 out of 10 of my last packages delivered have been either lost , not delivered , or delivered to someone else . They are absolutely zero help resolving the issue & they call you back in 3-5 business days . The workers are completely incompetent, & take absolutely zero action to effectively deliver your package. They can‚Äôt even be bothered to leave a notice or ring the doorbell. I can‚Äôt wait until they go on strike again . DO NOT USE CANADA POST IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE."
Tracker said out for delivery today so I stayed home all day as it is my medicine 8pm came no parcel Purolator would have been here this isn't the first time this has happened to us garbage service
"I was at home, expecting a parcel. I saw no one coming that day but then, the tracking system said that a notice has been left and forced me to go to the post office to pick it up. No notice could be found anywhere. That means the carrier lied and didn't pass my house at all."
"No customer service, incompetent workers, extremely slow delivery."
"Lazy worker and over paid. They don't care about customer service. They are just a bunch of lazy worker paid 25$/h in workshop and 30$/h as deliver. No education, doesn't work on weekend... What's next ... Always late in delivery when Intelcom, Purolator are not. I know one thing when I was working for Purolator, customer service was priority! You miss it, you go back on road and you get paid overtime, but at least the customer was happy for the service."
Would rate 0. With intelcom or ups no issue but waiting for a shipment in Montreal sent from Missisauga. The expected delivery date was 3 days ago and it has not arrived yet. Their website says in transit for the last 3 days and no update on the delivery date. Customer service were not helpful. Stay away at all cost
"I paid 15$ for express shipping, not only did they lose my package but when I called to speak to customer service they absolutely did not car. All they told me was I had to wait 10 business days for them to look for my package.
I managed to speak to the company which I ordered my package from so they sent me a new one and again 15$ express shipping and they put the wrong mail box key so I still couldn't get my package. So once again I call customer service and once again not only did they not apologize but they didn't even care she just mumbled ‚ÄúIt'll take 3 business days to fix this‚Äù No mention of a refund or anything.
Canada Post is one of the most unprofessional companies I have ever seen, horrible customer service and it's like a bunch of uneducated people work there. I will never use Canada Post again, be warned."
Bad. Order 6 fretil chicken eggs and only 3 came in cracked the way they there the package around was terrible
"Overall ok, but slow at times."
Some of the most expensive shipping prices in the world. They make it incredibly difficult to run an e-commerce business. Glad I live close to the border 50-60 percent cheaper to use USPS
"Would pick 0 if I could. An absolute embarrassment to Canada for demolishing our country's name with it awful business practices and service. Promised 1-2 day delivery from a location 4 hours away. Item shipped Jan 6th, processed Jan 7th at 3am in now 2 days later has still not made its way to a delivery vehicle and now may or may not be delivered Jan 10th as per their ""customer service"" department after being on hold for 30+ minutes and then 10 more minutes for a ""team lead"" who was just walking around... they were trying to tell me that the transition from Ottawa to Kanata was large... FYI Kanata is part of Ottawa... 20 minutes no traffic , 40 minutes with. Do it twice a day every single day.. Literally the only company that doesn't meet its promised dates. I am question if the people running the show are really qualified. A shame and a waste of my time. Thanks"
"My package arrived as expected.The original estimated delivery date was extended by one day, which is perfectly reasonable and acceptable to me.The only issue I have with CanPost is that when a signature is required and you're not available, they don't re-deliver - you have to pick it up. Without a vehicle it is inconvenient during the winter months in Ottawa. Thank you."
"If there is an option for 0, I would pick 0! The service is really bad, there is no proper way of recording or tracking records. If the package is lost OR wrong item is delivered and returned OR for package not received at all, they just leave it to the customer to trace or figure out what to do without giving clear instruction or suggestions because clearly they do not keep clean records of each of the items received on their part. It is very frustrating to find ways on how to resolve the issue without proper documentation. Recently, I was expecting a shoes but the package delivered was a huge box of TV. I asked my husband to return the item because I thought it is so unfair for the person who ordered the TV. The post office (Rexdale location) just received the TV without giving any documentation or recording in their system. What happened was, the label/tracking number of the shoes was pasted on top of the label/tracking number of the TV. Obviously my name was on the top label(or tracking number) that's why they thought the TV was mine. But having it returned to the same location, they didn't even bother to put a note in the system that the wrong item was received and returned. So after few weeks that my purchase was not received yet, since they didn't put anything on their system - something like a note that wrong item was returned, I had to go back and forth to the location and giving me different instruction to call their customer service and the customer service of the product I ordered. Too much hassle and frustration having to repeat the story over and over and over again. It lasted for a month and left unsolved! So frustrating."
"Too bad there aren't negative stars for reviewing Canada Post. In the past ""few"" years I have had occasion to call Canada Post twice. Both times resulted in rude, unprofessional and acompletely inadequate responses from Canada Post. Today's call was no different. I had (at the beginning of the call) opted to give a review but I now know that the person with whom I spoke would not get off the line for she (Elizabeth is her name) was well aware that she would get a completely underwhelming review. At one point in the conversation she basically told me to be quiet so she could explain the situation as she saw it. So (and this is not typical for my behaviour) I did comply. When it was my ""turn"" to speak--guess what--she did exactly the same thing she was accusing me of. I let her know that she was just as rude as I was. I had been given instructions to stay on the line after I had spoken with the customer service representative (boy there's an inappropriate title if ever there was one when it comes to Canada Post). I waited and I could hear that the line was still ""open"" which meant I was not redirected to the survey. I know why. This review is a not the avenue that I expected to take but I had little other recourse. It is my belief that Canada Post should either abolish any notion of a Customer Service entity or at least provide some training. If they do admit to training it seems to me it is likely UNT (Ultimate Neanderthal Training)."
"They lost my passport and now its been 5 days i am contacting customer service from Canada Post but non action has been taken. And moreover its not in the regular mail, it was with the express post. I really have no idea what to do at this moment."
"Horrible. Paid for fastest shipping.. 4 days late

Just about every time i use canada post its very poor delivery. Should not be in business"
"Absolute garbage service. Says my package was out for delivery on Monday, by end of day Tuesday still nothing and they keep telling me it'll be there or they hope it shows up. When I submitted a ticket I was told not to follow up with them until 1 week has passed. I also find it funny they ask how much your package is worth (should have lied an said over $1000). THANKFULLY I ordered my item through Amazon and they were amazing/ refunded me no questions asked and all was handled in five minutes. I will never say a good thing about Canada Post ever again, and I'm looking forward to bashing their reputation any chance I get."
"I had some personal items mailed, and paid extra to have them rushed. It was supposed to take 2 days. Before I knew it, it had been 3 WEEKS! and my parcel had not arrived. Turns out they lost it. After almost a month and a half they finally found my parcel and just mailed it back to the return address. What a joke of a service. Now I‚Äôm afraid to mail anything, in the fear they will lose it."
Stupid lies . Never use there service .!!
"Why even have an expected delivery date if it is so wildly inaccurate?

Expected delivery January 3rd. Haha nevermind that its the 4th now. Oh wait no now its the 7th. Stop at the PO on the 7th to pick it up haha no its the 8th now. Check the date now on the 8th ""jokes on you haha its still in mississauga apparently and the date is the 13th now"". 2 weeks later than ""expected"" and im pretty sure on the 13th it will be ""expected delivery january 18th""

And dont even get me started on the items forever lost, eternal sacrifices to the Post gods."
"I would give ZERO if I could. I want to change the default location of postal delivery. The current location is actually physically closer to my home but because of where it's located, it's further and extremely inconvenient, especially without a car. As it's on the other side of the QEW, I would have to Uber it to get there, unlike the post office of my choice. Changing deliver locations is not an option. I would have to let each delivery/company know where to send a package in case I'm not able to receive it. Can you imagine doing that for every package you're expecting?

On top of that, when you call Canada Post, the voice mail says that you can also do an online chat. Um...NO, you cannot. The most ironic thing is that I was asked, while online, to participate in a survey. I opted in and the survey never loaded! Brilliant!"
The way they run their business is so bad! They always mail my package to my neighbours! It happened to me not just once! But more than 10times! & I‚Äôve lost a lot of packages that I can‚Äôt count nomore! You Contacted the customer service but they‚Äôre useless it‚Äôs just a stupid computer voice! Even when you try to contact the real person who run the customer service.. they will ask you to contact the sender etc.. after all doing those shtz problems still unfixed. It will happen again eventually! They will not even refund the items! You should hire people who can do the job right! I‚Äôm so sick of this!
"10 days and counting from Mississauga to London. It's just sitting at a shipping facility, but they assure me it would not be released to me if I came to pick it up. Which sounds like theft to me, but whatever."
"Delivery went missing...yet again. It takes about 40 minutes to get through to customer service on the phone, and it takes 3 business days to move to the next step when filing a ticket for a missing package. If they can‚Äôt find the package, they tell you that you now have to contact the sender to dispute the rest (I.e. getting a refund). Basically, they pretend to try to find your package and then give up. It is a very inefficient and poorly run company. They need a new business model.

This has happened to me more than once and usually I check the delivery service before ordering online because I know how terrible and unreliable canada post is, so I don‚Äôt order if that‚Äôs the shipping service. I forgot to this time, and I was punished.

One week later and still no package. They told me they can‚Äôt find it and to contact the sender. (January 2020)."
"AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGH !
Post gone missing AGAIN. I was selling items from the UK to Canad and have stopped because over 50% of the items were going missing and I ended up with some shocking Amazon reviews.

With my fingers crossed I sent my son a Christmas stocking (that Father Christmas asked me to do......). He is working in BC for the Winter and low and behold it's vanished. Such a shame and so unnecessary. I can't believe that a ""developed"" nation can have such an appalling service in this day and age.
I am not sure what the Christmas stocking thief will make of all the funny toys and games in my old rugby sock. ( hope they choke on the chocolates) !
Good luck Canada - you get most things right - just some of the basics get you stumped - come on SORT IT OUT !
Rant over......."
"I did an online order from Vancouver. Jan 2 at 8:26 pm the item is processing through the Richmond Canada Post distribution center. On Jan 3 at 1:36 pm the item departed Richmond. On Jan 3, 10:18 pm the item arrived at its destination. According to tracking, the item was to be delivered by end of day Jan 6.

It is now 6:30 pm Jan 6. The item has not been delivered!

I have had this experience, late delivery by Canada Post, 15 times in 2019, at least 15 times in 2018, and unknown amount of times of later delivery in 2017!

Canada Post is a complete joke! The government of Canada should dismantle Canada post and allow the private sector to deliver our mail! It is obvious, Canada Post is not up to the challenge delivering parcels on time! They dont care either! I have used their ""online chat"". Script reading is their way feeble attempt in solving delivery issues! The incompetence of management, and postal workers is outrageous!"
"Would probably give you a better review, if you made the effort on actually dropping off my packages. instead of just slipping them into the postbox. no effort whats so ever to actually come up to the door. just a packing slip in the community box

this is now the 4th time this has happened. always love having to wait even longer!"
"I have twice shipped packages overseas, and twice they have went missing and never reached their destination. For domestic mail service, trust Canada Post. For international mail service, do not. Its seems they are not as competent when it comes to delivering packages overseas. They have a long way to go until they ever reach US Postal Service that competes with all major international courier services such as DHL."
"Amazing service and amazing delivery man, the delivery man is totally not pointing a gun at my head forcing me to write this and totally didn't just straight up take my 1200$ laptop that they are supposed to deliver."
Disgustingly horrible service. I paid $120 for overnight shipping from Alberta to Ontario as it was a time sensitive package. Package doesn‚Äôt arrive till 10 days later and zero response after 3 opened tickets. Now I need it shipped back to sender immediately but customer service is non existent. I can‚Äôt believe how bad of a company this is. Why are they still in business?
One of the worst companies out there .. they have one job to do deliver packages and letters and they can't even do that properly...all they concern is money.... Overpriced from services provided .. avoid using then at all cost... 0 liability and worst customer service ..
"Package shipped via Royal Mail/ Canada Post. I received shipping advice from company in the UK that my package had shipped early morning of December 10/2019. It is now January 4/2020 5:30 p.m.
No package! All of my past orders from this company have been received in 5 business days. I don't know if the problem is Canada Post or Canada Customs but have done a little searching and it seems that both are having issues. Not happy!

01//08/2020
Still waiting. It will be a month on Friday. I believe that there must be a trans-Atlantic Pony Express. Received a package today mailed from India on 12/16/2019. How many more thousand of miles did it have to travel???????"
"Every single time I've ordered something online that being delivered through Canada Post the item has arrived late. And their tracking, oh my. The latest package that was supposed to get delivered to me was scanned in Hamilton on December 31 (coming from Brampton and going to Brantford) and was supposed to arrive on January 2. On January 3 I saw an update showing that it was scanned in Mississauga (the opposite direction). The tracking still shows expected delivery date of January 2nd 3 days later. It's an expedited parcel with ""on-time delivery guarantee""."
"I have had a packages signed by the courier using my initials so that they can leave the package on the porch. Phoned the supervisor which was extremely rude and offered no explanation.

Couriers have the delivery notice already made and stick it on the door, don't bother ringing the door bell and take off.

Packages with tracking disappear and are never found. Try getting answers from this terrible corporation. Packages are probably being stolen from within their sorting facility.

Packages sit for days without tracking updates. Only government owned businesses can operate in this very non competitive manner.
They couldn't survive in the real world for a day.

They need some serious restructuring, what an embarrassment for Canada."
Canada Post is the worst service I have had in a long time. Canada Post is an embarrassment to Canada. The employees are rude and ignorant and totally ignore the customers needs and questions. I left the customer service counter feeling totally frustrated with their lack of communication skills a strong lack of confidence in their service and ripped off by their ridiculous prices which brings me to this review. I tried mailing a Christmas present to Spain to my 5 month old grandson over five weeks ago which as of today he still has not received . I was given three choices Ship which they said could take up to 4 months airmail with no tracking number which could take 2 to 3 weeks and priority with a tracking number which should take a week . I went with the airmail which was already quite expensive. I think customers should not have to pay extra for a tracking number it should automatically be provided by Canada Post It may hold them more accountable for their incompetence. They also need to adopt a new hiring process their employees have very poor attitudes if I worked like them at my job I would be fired. Judging by the poor reviews I have been reading I can see I am not the only very dissatisfied customer I will end this review by saying do not have any expectations when you use this very poor service
"I was asking for help about the incomplete address and if there was anything I could do. The agent had an attitude. I specifically told him that his voice was breaking out and I genuinely asked if he could repeat what he said couple times and later he gave me a complete shut down. I wouldn't have been mad if there was nothing they could do it was the attitude I was frustrated with when I clearly told him that the phone line was breaking out.
I will never use Canada Post ever again."
"Horrible service, damaged packages, delays after delays ... 10 days delay because they routed it to the wrong sorting facility within the city."
"the new update to their website is so much worse for their already horrible customer service, and btw, every single time I have ordered something with Canada Post it gets delayed in some way, over 20 packages, no exaggeration. At this point, I believe they have a note in their system under my name to put in a delay just upon seeing my name."
"Uninformed staff, slow customer service SLA and expensive rates. I thought Australia Post was bad but Canada Post is two decades behind - so embarrassing for Canada!!!"
Worse service ever. Some of their delivery drivers are too lazy to even get off their butt and get out of the truck to deliver the package. Standing out front of my building speaking with someone from about 1:20 until 1:45 pm. Seen the Canada post van drive right by me. When I returned to my apartment I had a message from Amazon that there was at delivery attempt made at 1:33 pm. BS.One driver that does actually deliver and does his job told me that they have a few drivers who will just take them wherever they go when not delivered and say they attempted a delivery because they are to lazy to do their job.
"Bad, always late"
"Worst ever. Lost my parcel! Expensive and inefficient postal service! Cost $15 to ship within the province, and then lost my parcel! The management should be fired!
But as a Canadian, what other choice do we have? :("
"Garbage service. I ordered a speaker dec15
th with expidted shipping from amazon and i am a prime member. Got it 20 days later.

Union trash."
Canada Post is likely the worst carrier you will ever deal with and should advertise that they f***ing suck.
"Absolute trash. Deserve zero stars and to go out of business.

They lose packages. Other packages are delayed for weeks.
An express shipped item for which I paid extra to have delivered on time will not be arriving. Big surprise!
These guys deserve to sink."
"Another publicly owned ,terribly managed company .
Less than half a star.
Very disappointed with expedited
Service thst is supposed to be here last week and no one from Canada post knows whereit it is after one week, should have called fedex ."
"They have lost parcels of mine, one was $200 worth of merchandise from H&M. It was never delivered yet was marked as delivered in their system...when I called them about it they made me feel as if I was inconveniencing them. I had no resolution from them at all. I started a service ticket with them and when I called back to check on it as it was past the expected resolution date I was ‚Äúserved‚Äù by a condescending guy named Matt who told me I should be patient. Matt and Canada Post get a big middle finger from me."
"I ordered a gift on line as the store(The Source) does not carry this model at the store, only on line. The Source uses Canada Post to deliver parcels (sad but true). According to Canada Post tracking site I was to receive it Dec 30, 2019. It appears for some unknown reason, the parcel got redirected to ‚ÄúUnionville‚Äù. Confirmed address was correct, so no one could explain. They said the parcel was being redirected back and I should receive Dec 31/19 by 8pm. I was told by Canada Post (Mark) that I could not open a ticket until after 8pm on Dec 31/19, this after waiting for over 15 minutes to be answered on their chat facility. Here I sit no delivery yet and I truly do not believe it will be here in the next 45 minutes. So at 8:01pm I will put in a ticket. I have no control of who the store uses for their delivery... so I wait.
Ticket opened and still waiting.
Jan 2/20 still waiting. 4pm no call, no parcel and no ticket update. I have a view that this parcel has been lifted (stolen).."
"Our crackhead post driver left a package on our doorstep belonged to someone down the street when I asked him why he said he was busy and could I deliver it ,I‚Äôm disabled"
"I sent my parcel which contained very confidential information, including my SIN, bank account details, IDs, etc., from Montreal to Quebec city through express/registered mail with tracking option on December 21, 2019, and since then there have been no updates on the status of delivery on their website. I called the customer service - they do not have any idea whether or not it has been delivered. Ther suggest it might even be lost at this moment already! And I paid $CAD 15 for this service. So frustrating! I am not going to use Canada Post any more!"
"I would give this a minus 5 stars if I could. There is no worse delivery service than Canada Post in Toronto when it comes to packages, even worse than Amazon. Those Canada Post delivery drivers are the worst lazy nimrods there is. HOW HARD IS IT TO RING THE DOORBELL????? I don't care if the drivers are very busy, DO YOUR DAMN JOB LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. I'm on disability, so I'm always home and how inconvenient do you think it is for a disabled person having to pick up a package at the pick-up location? Unfortunately, it's the world we live in nowadays. NOBODY CARES ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICES ANYMORE. I'm actually surprised that Canada Post management doesn't do something about this serious problem with their delivery drivers. Does management care about their customer delivery service? What am I paying for?"
"Was pretty good until a year ago or so...since then..lots of mail simply lost..different delivery people, different schedules...etc...couriers are far superior...really a shame..."
"Absolutely useless. If there was an option for negative stars, I‚Äôd give negative. Why bother giving a delivery date if you cannot manage to deliver within that time. My package has been sitting in a sorting facility 6 hours away for two weeks. Every time I call I‚Äôm told that they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking into it and going to monitor the scans‚Äù which is pretty amazing since there have not been scans for over two weeks! Amazing that companies like loomis or purolator can have something brought from the other end of the country and delivered within 4 days, but Canada post can not manage to get a parcel from halfway across a single province in 30 days.

The reason they‚Äôre loosing so much money is people taking thier business elsewhere. I would rather put my money towards a company that can make deliveries on time and abide by delivery times they set than with a company that is so far mismanaged, the only thing they deliver is excuses."
"Would give 0 stars, Canada post drivers are the most useless people imaginable. Instead of knocking or ringing the doorbell or even leaving a package that will fit in the mailbox they run to your door, drop a pickup notice and then run back to their vehicle and leave. Not once but every single time.

Just look at the percentage of negative reviews, it‚Äôs astonishing.

Canada post go fvck yourself"
Worst than bad would describe their service. Recently had a parcel shipped for a Christmas present for my wife. I paid for 2 day delivery. That was on December 12th. Today is December 31. Well that was 19 days ago and Christmas has long passed. On top of all the nonsense calling them without results. I will no longer ship anything by Canada post. To boot the parcel sat at a dispatch in my city for 10 days before it went out for delivery. Also worth mentioning is I haven't received it yet but got notified that it is out for delivery today. Based on their information system that could be wrong as well. Completely useless tracking system and delivery to say the least!!!
Worst outfit ever.....I can see why your broke. Over 7 days to send a parcel 55kms. A horse and buggy is faster. Oh customer service is no existent like their useless phone service. I can't speak to a person and they want to create an account to make a service log.
"Sent a package to vanderhoof. They had put it up top on the shelf out of view because they are obviously incapable of doing their jobs.

Relatives had to go five times back before they were told it was there. I even called and the lady was rude. Is this what vanderhoof is coming too, typical lack of customer service on their part. Horrible, just horrible and embarrassing to have used Canada post in vanderhoof. Lol"
"Without a doubt one of the most useless organizations i have had the miss pleasure of dealing with, constantly loosing parcels,never delivered when said would be delivered, do not use Canada post,by all means find someone else to look after your parcels. SIMPLY rediculous that Canadian taxpayers have to support another Canadian embarassment."
It has been one week since the tracking info stated my item was out for delivery but still nothing has arrived. After contacting support they stated my item would be delivered today but that was a lie. I now have no idea where my package is.
"If I could rate it 0 stars. I would.
Their online tracking is NEVER updated on time(ex: it may be shipped already but there won't be an update). They also often provide an ""estimated delivery date"" and you may (if you're lucky) see it about a week after. It is incredibly slow and unreliable and I would recommend using any other company if you can."
"I cannot believe this is our national postal service. I would pay more money to use a different courier. Pathetic. Never in twenty years have they delivered a package properly. Each time ""an attempt was made"" which is utter BS. Nothing in the mailbox or at my house. It is clear there was no attempt made because I've been waiting in my living room before and after my package was ""attempted"" to be delivered. I hope postal Canada is shut down and replaced with a service that actually delivers packages."
"Priority package from US still undelivered for 2 weeks now.

Attempted delivery at 2:26 PM on Dec. 24 but our business hours was only up to noon. ""Item on hold for second delivery attempt."" - OK.

Dec. 27 is the next working day, no delivery attempted. Called Canada post earlier that day to inquire about the delivery and was told that delivery is until 8 pm. I replied that our business hours is until 5 PM which is also printed at our door. Agent replied that they can't transmit the message. - NOT GOOD.

Over the weekend, I am concerned about the delivery time might happen after 5 PM. So, I called on Dec. 29, Sunday. Agent - CANNOT change delivery to pickup anything from US. Can not control delivery time. I said I wanted the delivery driver to know that our office is until 5 PM. No attempt should be done after 5 PM and she replied SHE CANNOT DO ANYTHING. B*LLSH*T!!!

Canada Post - IF YOU STILL WANT BUSINESS, DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER!!!!!!!!"
Piece of crapp company I hope you all go bankrupt and lose your jobs.
"Canada Post lives in the 18th Century. It is impossible to change forwarding address from abroad (USA in our case).
Anyone who has their mail forwarded to a temporary address should carefully read the documentation. Canada Post, IN VERY SMALL CHARACTERS, indicates that no change can be made from outside Canada, that one cannot even cancel and list a new forwarding address. That can only be done on site in Canada, not on the WEB, as one would expect in the 21st Century.
Very importantly, Canada Post will NOT forward registered mail and other important pieces of mail (Priority, Express Post, etc.) out of the country or even alert the addressee that notice of such an important item has been left in the mailbox back in Canada.
In the FINE print, it states that ""Canada Post has the right to change the conditions and modalities of service at any time"". Try that one if you are in the private sector.
That organization needs to be privatized and modernized rapidly."
"Drivers are useless and make no attempt to deliver the package, Instead they run up to the door with the delivery pickup notice and stick it on the door and run back to their truck and take off. They do this with every single delivery, leaving it up to me to drive to the post office to pick it up.

There have also been many times that I have more than 1 package arriving the same day and one or more don't even go out for delivery, sometimes the one that gets delivered arrives at the sorting center later than the ones that didn't get delivered. wth?

They are putting their job on paying customers because they are useless, absolutely f'n ridiculous.

Perfect example of how incompetent Canada Post truly is... This was scheduled to be delivered this morning and another package arrived that got the the sorting center before this,,, Canada Post's excuse was it arrived too late at the sorting center however it arrived 2 days ago? seriously frustrated and never using Canada Post again.

"If I could rate -10 stars, I would. I ordered a package nearly 10 days ago now. I paid $15 to have it delivered within 2 days, and it still has not arrived. I have made countless attempts to claim back my money but because I am not technically the sender (Urban Planet is) they refuse to refund. I have tried calling, emailing and writing a ""ticket"" and have received absolutely no response. I understand that the mail is backed up and that everyone is busy because of the holidays, but do not offer this PRICEY option of shipping if you cannot uphold your standers. I am frustrated, and angered, and will not be using Canada Post again."
"Horrible horrible experience, after spending $140 to ship a 2kg package they have no clue were the package is, they have to investigate and they told me I will have a resolution by March 2020, thats 3 Months, on top of that when I was trying to explain the package was a Christmas gift for my mother who has dementia the lady in the chat cut the conversation off, thats really sad and disappointing, will never use Canada post again."
"i love y'all. Jk, terrible service, all ways late on orders.




F y'all"
"If I could give zero stars I would! Canada Post is the worst postal service I was ever experienced. I have lived in many countries and despite Canada being the second biggest country in the world, Canada postal service is the worst service possible with unreliable service, damaged packages and a ridiculous amount of time for delivery of items. Christmas gifts recieved today December 27th despite being in Canada Posts possession weeks ago and they arrive today, damaged, WET and after the big day. The worst service possible."
"Canada Post has ruined my Christmas. They are very incompetent. I ordered 2 things from Amazon on Dec. 15th,and I am Prime. Amazon has done their best to send it out on time, but Canada Post is horrible. I was suppose to get these on Dec. 19th originally. They are complete liars. They said that I would get it on Dec. 23rd, and it didn't show, then on the 24th, and now on the 27th. It's late in the day, and still not sending this to me. It has been stuck in Halifax. I told them I would drive across the harbor and go get it in Halifax, but they won't allow me to do that either. I have called several times, every day. They lied and said they put a ticket, plus a note on it, but it doesn't make a difference. They are LIARS and who knows, maybe thieves, as well. It's quite obvious that I'm never getting it. I feel like getting hold of Steve Murphy on CTV news and telling everyone about Canada Post and their horrible service. Thanks for nothing Canada Post"
"Lame service. Why have priority post shipping?
I paid for 3-5 day shipping and 10 days later still no parcel. How can other courier service keep their commitments but yet Canada post can‚Äôt?
Christmas or not ! 10 days for express post .. a two big thumbs DOWN !
Next time I will take me Business to a carrier that will keep their commitments"
"I ordered two robot vacuums, one week apart, at the beginning of December. Both packages showed up quickly to the Winnipeg sorting facility where tracking has stopped. After no delivery I launched an investigation through CP. Their conclusion...‚ÄùOur investigation into your request indicates that no scan has been uploaded to the Canada Post tracking system to indicate delivery of your item‚Äù

Well duh. Where‚Äôs my packages?!!

In addition, this is what CP said, ‚ÄúAny further action must be initiated by the sender of the item. If you have still not received the item, please notify the sender and instruct them to contact Canada Post if they wish to initiate a claim.‚Äù

It‚Äôs almost a certainty that both vacuums were stolen by CP employees. Because I went through amazon I‚Äôve received a refund but it‚Äôs not right that this is allowed to happen as amazon likely will not pursue further action. And the culprit(s) knows it and will continue to get away w it."
"Canada Post is utterly useless. Any other delivery service with an est arrival date such as UPS DHL etc deliver on time or at worst case a day later. Canada Post - who knows they make an estimated date but it might be days to weeks later. They don‚Äôt care to even try to follow through on their estimated date. Paying more for premium Canada post deliveries is just waste of money.

The only positive thing I can say is I‚Äôm always happy when my amazon prime is delivered by Canada post because I know they will never made the amazon prime delivery time so I‚Äôve been able to extend my prime membership by almost a year this way for free since a late delivery on prime gets you one month extra with prime. Every other courier delivers on time but Canada post delivers on time about 25% max. So thanks to Canada posts bad delivery times I get free prime."
"Stuff from China normally takes 6 weeks, even longer, and I‚Äôve received empty envelopes that made it through customs intact but had the expensive contents stolen once across the border. I have friends whose mail wasn‚Äôt delivered for weeks because of street work. Obviously the people could come and go from their homes, yet CP used it as an excuse not to deliver, and made no warning that they wouldn‚Äôt. One of the service cuts in the last few years involves CP no longer allowing any bins at the post offices, yet they continue putting flyers in our boxes despite people opting out of junk mail, so some people are dumping the unwanted flyers on the floor (I don‚Äôt blame them) and it‚Äôs now causing conflict in the community. It‚Äôs very, very expensive to send packages. I‚Äôm now considering boycotting CP and trying other options. Except that the govt has made it law that the other options will be much more expensive and as with everything in Canada the issue is not enough competition, and the laws are made so that there can be no competition. It‚Äôs like an abusive boyfriend you just can‚Äôt quit."
"Canada Post seems slow/inefficient in comparison to other postal services. I have had more good experiences than bad, but when it is bad it is terrible and this should not happen in this business.

For example, I recently bought a small item from Germany sent regular/economy post to me in Torbay Newfoundland. I was given a tracking number and tracked via PostNL. It took only five days to get to Canada from Germany. Once in Canada tracking stopped and it has been fifteen days since and waiting. I assume this package initially went to a sorting/clearance facility in Ontario or somewhere far away and now has to make its way back to Newfoundland.

This lag is unacceptable especially since I have had similar packages sent from Germany and Britain in the past and have had them arrive in an acceptable time frame. For me, the inconsistency is the issue and also the lack of tracking. I am sure Canada Post would offer reasons why tracking economy parcels is not done but I find this hard to accept given that other countries do. I realize that shipping in and out of Canada is very costly and logistically difficult. Perhaps with regard to small package delivery, there should be a single entity handling all in Canada. Possibly subsidized by taxpayers, managed PROPERLY, with access to mailboxes etc. Basically a super Purolator. I know existing shipping companies would not like this, but the bottom line is servicing the residents of this large marginally populated country is a challenge and could be done better. Canadians are what constitute this country should be put first not companies or organizations."
"ridiculous. not sure why they bother offering/charging for ‚Äú3 day delivery‚Äù when they are by no means capable. i paid way too much for priority shipping and 2 weeks later have received nothing. funny enough, the package i did not pay priority shipping on is moving at the exact same pace - no difference in speed whatsoever despite paying extra. don‚Äôt offer services you can‚Äôt deliver, i would be happy to use canada post if they were upfront and honest about delivery times/expectations like amazon, ups, purlator, fedex, etc."
"Have sent letters, cards and parcels to Vancouver from the UK for 14 years and I‚Äôm so tired of this ridiculously incompetent service. When tracking, the item leaves the UK within hours, but then the troubles begin once Canada Post get their hands on them. What a shambles! Undelivered birthday and Christmas cards or packages, even important court documents delayed or lost. There equally appears to be no care, consideration or desire to make improvements. I will NEVER use CP again, and will use ANY other carrier other than them!!
CP... this is not simply a one off complaint, this has been 14 years of mounting frustration, financial loss and upset caused through lost, undelivered or late delivery! Thank you so much!!! üò°"
"Sent a Christmas postcard December 09 to Sweden. The Canada post website claims four to seven business days for international mail. It's Christmas day, eleven business days later, and recipient hasn't received their postcard. I paid $2.75 for the postage. I would like a refund. By far the worst service of any postal or delivery service."
"Update on Dec 27. It has been 7 days since CP picked up my item from the sender. Still not receding anything. It took 7 days for the item to go from Montreal to Mississauga. I am in BC!! Missed my European trip, and the. the whole Christmas, and now seems like I will miss the new year with family as well. I wish they do out of business.

Dec 24
The US embassy used CP‚Äôs express post service to deliver my passport, which is supposed to deliver on the same day or the next day. It took CP two days to pick up the item and scan them into their system and they stopped for the weekend. Anxiously waiting until after the weekend and only to be told my passport and other important documents were sent to a wrong location (even wrong province). Has been calling 4 times over 3 days now and no one can provide me any help. They can‚Äôt even tell me if my passport is still at the wrong location or has been shipped out again. Other than waiting and keeping my finger crossed, there is nothing I can do. I have been stuck in the country since Dec 19 and I think I will be stuck until Jan as their freaking office close for weekends and holidays."
Since dec 4 my package is MIA . Dec 23 updated after my trenth attempt to reach them . They found my package and on its way. I used a polite approach to talk to them and bingo my package on its way after 19 days package stranded. Thank you CP for your help. I thought I'd be bummed out 300 dollars of gifts. Life is fantastic. Happy holidays.
Worst postal delivery service ever. I‚Äôve lived all over the world and this is the worst postal service I‚Äôve ever seen. I will remember this every Christmas from now on and use Fedex or ups instead. Canada post flat out ruining so many people‚Äôs Christmas. And they‚Äôre staff will be the ones who go home and enjoy it. Hoping others won‚Äôt use their service this time of year any more too and hopefully they‚Äôll feel it financially. An absolute joke of a company.
WORST SHIPPING COMPANY I don‚Äôt recommend Canada post they slow and big asss thief I‚Äôm so mad I lost my $88 for express shipping to France and it‚Äôs been 7 business days my clients still didn‚Äôt receive the mail. Their shipping prices high as fuk and they don‚Äôt do proper work. SKIP this company I‚Äôm telling you.
Worst post company in Canada they went on strike an made it so shipping cost are like 30 bucks on top of your order an they are slow as fuk you‚Äôd think with all that money they‚Äôd be fast but they are the slowest snail mail motherfukers ever huge rip off boycott Canada post 2020
The mail person came to my home and did not even attempt to deliver the expedited delivery package. They just left a note saying that t could pick it up at the local store. 4 yes 4 trips and I still don't have the parcel. Absolutely no one is offering any help or can be reached. As a Canadian I am embarrassed that such an awful company uses our proud name. Perhaps we can get an act of parliament to some day you might get your mail post.
"Worst service I‚Äôve ever seen
I was supposed to receive a parcel in British Columbia from Toronto on December 20,2019
As it was a priority shipping on December 18,2019.
I called them on December 20,2019 they said you will receive it by December 23,2019
As of December 22,2019. If you track that item it was showing still in Toronto and on December 23,2019 it was scanned in new brunswick. When I called them on 23 December. A rude lady on phone said we can‚Äôt do anything. My important stuff was in that parcel and these people think it's a joke.
This, is what they do with priority shipping. I wonder how they deal with just normal deliveries. I don‚Äôt know what should i do?
How to get that parcel back?"
My package is 45 minutes away from where I live and it‚Äôs been there for 5 days I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I can go there and get it myself it would be faster at least.
"As many others, I too wish I could give zero stars. Canada post and their drivers could care less about actually delivering parcels, it's embarrassing. One of the worst legacies Canada will leave."
"UNBELIEVABLE! I understand all parcel/mail delivery companies are extremely busy this time of year and there are delays. However, I mailed an expedited parcel, ON - NS on Dec 07, expected arrival Dec 12. It is now Dec 22, and it still hasn't been delivered. I'm not sure why it takes 3 days to move a parcel a 2 hour drive. Now it's probably going to take another 2 days to travel the remaining 100km from the last scan with no option to stop delivery/redirect to be picked up instead. From a business perspective: hire more people and pay the over time this time of year. The slow service is unacceptable."
"Wow!!! I sent a parcel to B.C. from Ontario on the 4th of Dec. and it's now the 22 and the parcel is still quite a distance from the destination.So, the bottom line is...she won't get for Christmas.Maybe I should have mailed it in November???? Also, I paid for faster service on another small light envelope to be delivered within 4-5 days to Alberta and paid 17 bucks for this little light weight. It took 11 days so I was ripped off. I don't CARE about the weather or whatever being an issue. Not my problem.I paid for a service I did NOT receive. Now! the person I sent it to is overseas and didn't get on time and it was probably thrown on step for porch pirates to take!!!! I will not use Canada Post again for anything!! I was scammed into paying extra money for a lie and this is NOT the first time. I paid extra 2 months ago. Same thing. Let it go. But this time I am going to do something about it."
If you have any other shipping choice take it first. Canada Post is the worst of the worst. Packages will come weeks late if they ever come at all.
"Canada Post doesn't update their site, delivery is rarely if ever on time and it's expensive... avoid at all costs!!"
"Absolutely horrible. My experience began by sending two parcels from central Canada to the same address in North Dakota USA which is relatively close when looking at the higher picture.
8 days later one of the parcels showed up, and the other didn‚Äôt. I looked at the tracking and the one that hasn‚Äôt shown up was sent to the east coast Canada. It was only updated twice, and that was when it entered their system in Saskatoon (wasn‚Äôt entered for two days after I dropped it off even though I dropped it off on a Wednesday) and then again when it got to Ontario 6 days later. It‚Äôs been another 5 days and there is no update. Whatever, I understand that it‚Äôs right before Christmas. However why would one arrive and not the other. So I attempted to look into it and Canada post is IMPOSSIBLE to speak to a real person! They want the customer to do everything online with a window of ten days for them to respond. And every time I tried to call customer service they said they were experiencing a high volume of callers and disconnected me.
I found a new number to call and I‚Äôve been on hold now for twenty minutes. I‚Äôm so frustrated. It wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if I could have just got ahold of customer service the first time I tried three days ago.
I send parcels to North Dakota a few times a year, but will I ever use Canada Post again? Never!"
"These people lost my parcel and refused to do anything because I couldn't contact the sender, even so I paid for it. They also hang up on me on chat, without any explanation. Disgasting...!! Although the employee in my town and very friendly and work way too hard for what the corporate pays them. The chat people are always rude and crunky. I rather loose the 50 worth on item than be treated like garbage by these miserable people. There are many polite trully kind young enthusiastic students or younster,who would love to treat customers with respect and kindness."
"The employees in Nova Scotia have ruined xmas for our family and they don't even give a darn. Worst customer service ever. They complain it's a busy time of the year and get you to pay xpress post and you still don't recieve your parcels in a week and they are sitting an hour away but there's nothing they can do. The Canada post workers in don't deserve the employment, we all have responsibilities but i guess if you work for the government you don't have to be accountable, this service is a joke and should be done with and privatized. Thanks for nothing!"
"Absolutely disgusting! You charge an arm and a leg for express shipping than stick the express stuff on a back burner! So far it has taken 4 days to get 45 mins down the 401!

I absolutely dispise the way you operate not only as a ""business"" but also how you mistreat your employees!

I paid extra to have my stuff shipped quicker! You took my money and fell through on your and of the bargain!

Update: just got a tracking update and my item will not arrive until Dec 26... 9 days later!!! It's a good thing I paid extra for 3 day shipping or else it wouldn't make it for Christmas 2020!!! Why do you excessively charge for something you can NOT deliver!

You're corrupt and it's Bullship!"
"I wish I could give them a zero, they don't even deserve a 1. I ordered something on Dec. 11 was sent the tracking number and the Canada Post website said it was processed and ready for the delivery truck Dec. 14, it still says on the their website that its out for delivery and will be delivered by day end Dec. 16, today is the 20th, I contacted them and they basically said ya that's what it says if you don't hear from us by Dec. 27th contact us again, in other words get lost. The retailer I purchased it from just keeps telling me to check with Canada Post. What horrible service Canada Post provides, no wonder they are going downhill and they keep complaining that they other delivery services are putting them out of business, of course they are because you can't deliver so why would people want to use you!!!! Totally useless, absolutely horrible and they don't care at all."
"Stop stealing people's money, if you change expedited fees and can't get a package from Toronto to Ottawa writhing 8 days you are pretty useless. It's just a form of theft"
I purchased an item from the United Kingdom at the beginning of December. I got told it would be shipped to my home by December 10-16. I called Canada post the 18th and they told me they couldn‚Äôt help me due to the fact that it‚Äôs international. I get that it‚Äôs the holidays and it‚Äôs a busy time but my sister was getting her packages from Canada post everyday and when I‚Äôm sitting here wondering if my package is lost or not it‚Äôs a BIG inconvenience especially because that package is a gift for a coworker. Not sure if I can trust Canada post any longer.
"Wost services ever ! Questions ? Why yours employees don't know, what is a door bell just live the package an run.. Also still wondering how his able to put, inside the smallest mail box that made for envelopes. One pair of woman winter boots size 6, in that small mail box add to destroy the box. Just to get the package out, to make a complaint there site work the same as theirs employees.
Waste of time making complaints cause, it will never change. IF POST CANADA DOES CARE, DON'T WANT NO CHANGE.
JUST FUC..... SHUT DOWN AN SELL !"
"Parcel stolen while in Canada Post's possession! No compensation...
In another instance shipment's time of arrival changed from 4 days to 7 days!; no explanation / justification...
Very disappointing...
Wondering how they're still in business."
"ISENT TWO FLAT RATE BOXES ON DEC 3RD TO ALBERTA AND AS OF TODAY DEC.19TH AT 9:10 AM THEY ARE STILL IN TRANSIT.IT HAS TAKEN 12 DAYS TO GET TO MONTREAL FROM NFLD.SINCE BEING ACCEPTED IN MONTREAL ON THE 15 TH THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWING IN TRANSIT,SO WHAT HAPPENED TO 7 TO 10 DAY DELIVERY. AS FOR THE TRACKING THAT WILL ONLY WORK WHEN CANADA POST USES IT THE WAY IT WAS MENT TO WORK ,WHICH IS PUT IN THE INFORMATION CONCERNING EACH PACKAGE .YOU GUYS ARE THE PITS AND DONT DESERVE ON STAR"
This joke of a company has had my item sit n a warehouse for 6 days before processing it. This company is a complete joke.
"Canada Post is the worst postal service ever. Everyone there gives generic answers, wait times are more than 20minutes. They lost many of my packages and told me different things. Now I have to contact my buyer to ask them to open investigation. Even their Facebook social dont even reply to your messages! I have to message them twice to get a reply ""contact customer support *enters number*"" this is the fifth time they lost my package, with tracking number over the years. The delivery agents cant read and never delivered it to my house. They are incompetent. My house is so easy to find. Customer support doesnt understand timezones, they kept asking me to tell my sender to call when they aren't even open. Braindead, incompetent, and dont have a clue what they are doing. I am so frustrated everytime I have to talk to them. They dont understand and gives me their procedures. Horrible customer service, and horrible delivery service. I would honestly give 0 stars if I can. 5 items with tracking number, never delivered to my house when it says delivered. No one rang my doorbell, home all day, no parcels in my mailbox of my glass door, nada. Obviously they cant read my big number on my house. I have to go through this headache all the time. Hopefully my other packages will be with other carriers, better support, good accuracy, and they atleast can find my house on such an easy street, literally near the big intersections."
"Literally the worst postal service ever... You can't call them online if your parcel is late, they won't update you on the expected delivery, and they give out generic replies on their social media. Actual BS. Only postal service I've ever had problems with. Would give them 0 stars if I could"
"Literally the worst postal service out there. You can't call them online if your parcel is late, they won't update you on the expected delivery, and they give out generic replies on their social media. Actual BS. Only postal service I've ever had problems with. Would give them 0 stars if I could."
If i could give no stars i would. Canada post has lost 5 of my packages this holiday season. Absolutely ridiculous this has to be the qorst postal service in the world. Some packages are over 20 days late. Canada post has done nothing for me. I have called made claims and get no responce. WILL CANADA SELL CANADA POST ALREADY!!!! WHAT A JOKE
"Canada Post should be dissolved as a company. it is the shame for the nation. International shipments 2-3 months delay. They are killing online businesses.CLOSE, SELL, DISMANTLE this terrible corporation !!!!"
someone in end delivery opens packages and draws happy faces on my letters.I have lost ALL trust in Canada post.
"Canada Post is the worst courier ever! The drivers were lazy, they always put 'incorrect address information' (they had delivered to the same address many times) whenever they don't want to do their job, they deliver Amazon Prime Package in 10 days instead of 2 days."
"It's been a terrible experience. My packages were sent internationally and they were supposed to arrive a week ago. I'm going travelling tomorrow the packages were supposed to be gifts for my family since I'm visiting them for the winter holidays. Apparently I asked for too much, I paid express to get the packages within 5 working days and that was 3 weeks ago. I've been constantly calling them and they keep telling me that there are delays, they're doing their best, it's not their fault, etc. etc. This is disgraceful and I cant believe that they are doing this. All in all, my package is in transit since 2 days ago and I have no idea why it's taking so long to arrive to my city. Their customer service is trash and their delivery system is just pure chaos, amazing how they themselves cant contact another post to see if the package is being reviewed or in transit who knows maybe it's lost somewhere or maybe they stole all the $hit inside it. You guys should just straight up close your post services or at least get better at this."
Very poor and bad service. I can‚Äôt get the package almost 2 months. Very bad customer service. Nobody can help me with it or explain where is this package now
"Very disappointed in the flat-rate box. Not only are the boxes fairly small for the weight they allow, but they definitely go to the outside limit of their ""guaranteed delivery"" times. It says two days ""guaranteed"" when out of your province/zone, but they also give themselves up to seven days.

Last week, I sent a package using a flat-rate box, but it still hasn't arrived six days later ‚Äî so I guess we really are dealing with a seven-day timeframe. What makes it even worse is that a package sent by someone from the other end (the exact same town in Nova Scotia that I'm sending to) cost less and it took less time to arrive.

And a package I sent two days after my original mailing to the same address in Nova Scotia arrived today ‚Äî before the ""guaranteed delivery"" package.

I would suggest saving your money and just package your stuff the way you want. A special box won't get it there any faster, and the will probably cost you more."
"Awful services. If you are facing an issue, no one is responsible"
"this is the worst site I have ever tired to use. I've tried to us the ""live chat"" but in the length of time it took to get a LIVE person on the phone, I still could not get to the chat site! if you like to go in circles, try this site. Then the live person tells me that they can not give me information they have, ie the sender, I have to give it to them. My name, address, phone number, tracking number etc, is not enough information for them to release the sender? I'm upset but what can I do to resolve this issue."
"We are a business and expecting cheques that for some reason take more than 4 days to be delivered as Canada Post received the package Dec 11 and did not schedule delivery until Dec 16. THEY then TAKE ALL F$%^$^$ day to deliver and don't arrive until after the office closed (5pm). Instead of dropping the package off at the local post office, they drive it back to the depot and then drive to the same post office the next day instead of retrying to deliver to our address. The problem is that the post office is less than one klick away and if they had dropped it off, I could pick up the package first thing in the morning. IT is now 11:30am and the package is still not at the post office for me to pick up! WASTE of my time and the business!! MORONS!!!"
Its been 3 weeks late for my package to be delivered and theres still no sign of delivery. Worst service ever!
"I am sick of it...i should know better !...parcels disappear in the system once again...i am sure no one at canada post has a calendar, as christmas is actually an annual thing...i can see delays for things beyond one's control, but xmas does most assuredly come at the same time every year...if they were busy like this all year, they would be screwed...perhaps they could go down to the pool hall and gather some extra help...ah, maybe that's not a good idea !!!!!!!!!"
Why do we still have Canada post ...there system and service sucks ...the can not deliver on package correctly or on time ...and the tracking system is the pure craps...take a hint from USPS...always one time and always able to find...
I have a gripe with a Canada post truck driver who operates a 5 Ton truck in a very dangerous manner. Almost every morning at 5:45 am he speeds and tailgates other people up Clark drive heading north then swings a right turn on Broadway heading west in Vancouver . Please be more courteous and mindful of others. I hope nobody gets killed or injured.
"Im still waiting for my fail from amazon and ofcourse they let the worst post to handle my mail, canada post is waste"
"Recently, we were expecting a few mails from our friends. Two of the letters received were been sliced open. One of them has money order cheque that has been stolen and left with only Christmas card!

We previously had filed a few complains about our mail delivery but no one had got back to us or explained what happened. We need to get rid off the Crown Corporations because they are just too many corrupted people in there. Canada post needs to go or privatized."
"Canada post is the worst. They should be shut down immediately. They are so unreliable. They don‚Äôt care about customers. I‚Äôve had so many issues over the years, stolen packages, packages left in the street, claims they knocked and I wasn‚Äôt home several times, rude, and the management doesn‚Äôt care. They are utterly useless. Once a package that said DO NOT BEND was bent in half and destroyed and shoved through my mail slot. They never follow up on service tickets. They should be ashamed of themselves. If I see Canada post I honestly cringe and don‚Äôt buy.

This particular incident I ordered something for my
Mom, didn‚Äôt say Canada post was the carrier. I ordered the first couple of days in dec to ensure it arrived in time for Christmas from Hudson Bay and it still missing today. ‚ÄòDelivery by end of day dec 9‚Äô it‚Äôs now the 17th! They are sooooo awful and stupid. I have no idea where my package is and the tracking sucks! Useless they don‚Äôt even update it. They literally should all be fired it‚Äôs the most embarrassing thing about Canada. Shameful. No pride in their work. Monkeys would do a better job.

Not to mention my husband has sent me cards from Uk to Canada in the past and some never arrived. Also I have had gift cards no delivered. Thieves!"
they send my christmas gift to a wrong address!! i called them 10 times and their customer service is terrible and they lost my gift and they are the WORST!!!!!!!
I would give 0 stars if possible i have been dealing with Canada post for years sending and receiving packages with paid Express post and you know what ever single package has in common they never arrive on time and frequently ingnore package instructions that have led to multiple stolen packages over the years ultimately sick of the poor service from Canada post. You people constantly go on strike demand more money and then up service charges with no change to your overall downfalls as a service provider..overall Canada post is unreliable and at best and a never ending frustration to deal with!
They suck . There‚Äôs no other way to describe them . I ordered something from the USA and it was delivered in two days. Yet my package that was supposed to be shipped from Mississauga to be delivered to Hamilton was lost twice even when there‚Äôs a tracking number attached to that package . It‚Äôs been 10 days now and no news about my package. If monkeys were delivering the mail they would have done a better job than who ever running Canada post .
"Had a Christmas gift I ordered returned to sender in the US without any prior communication from Canada Post. If there was an issue with the address, why wasn't I contacted? Purolator had the same issue recently, however they reached out to me and corrected the error instead of sending my package back without speaking to me. When I asked for answers or how to stop it from being returned to sender, I got no answers. Extremely poor customer service team."
Mailed a birthday card from UK to Toronto on 2th December - it's now the 16th and not arrived to date. I know when letters have been sent from Canada to the UK it's been far quicker and efficient. What is wrong with the Canada Postal system?
"Doesn't seem to care about efficient delivery at all.
No email or anything telling me my package was delivered, and also delivered to the complete wrong house. I was lucky it was delivered to the house down the street and not the house across the street with neighbors who I have a problem with!

It's pretty embarassing that a DELIVERY service can't even get an address proper."
"If I could give them no stars I would. Every time I find out my package it getting delivered by Canada Post I know something will go wrong. I‚Äôve had delivery drivers lie, not leave the notice on my door and say they did, and have lost my parcel. Their tracking system is a joke...pretty much non-exsistent, not sure why they even have it. I never have a good experience with Canada Post. Every time I‚Äôm like maybe they won‚Äôt screw up, but they always do. They are such a waste of a delivering company. I don‚Äôt understand them. How do you not have your stuff together? UPS and Purolator have it together....and ALWAYS deliver on time, keep up with their tracking system and do this during all times of the year. They need to re-evaluate how they do things because Canada Post is a joke."
"I have had 3 AWFUL experiences in the last 3 weeks. Like the other reviews posted, Canada Post lost 3 of my packages, 3 separate times in 3 weeks. I truly resent this crown corporation. I hope the people running this place all get fired for not having good management."
"You would honestly think, that a company in the business of moving mail and parcels, and has delt with seasonal rushes and heavy workloads, at the same time ,every year, year after year, after year, that they could do at least a half assed job at dealing with the Christmas rush.."
"Summer 2019, I sent a package to my mom in Quebec. Canada Post lost the package, then delivered it over a month later.

December 5, 2019, I returned a package to Amazon via Canada Post. Canada Post lost the package and to this day still haven‚Äôt found it. I don‚Äôt get my money back from Amazon until Amazon received the returned package.

December 10, 2019, I purchased an item on Amazon. It was supposed to be here yesterday (Dec 13), it‚Äôs the 14th now and it‚Äôs still not here. No updates in the tracking system. So did they lose that too?

Use Canada Post at your own risk!"
"If I could give 0 stars, I would.

My husband and I both ordered new iPhones from Koodo online during their Black Friday sale. Long story short, the day of delivery, my husband was home all day waiting for our new phones to arrive. Not a single knock. He went out to bring the trash and noticed 2 slips stuck to our door. One for my phone and one for his. They were both on the same truck, both tried to be delivered at the same time and left on the same truck to be dropped off to the post office for next day pick up. Only thing is, mine was there for pick up and his was not. It just ‚Äúvanished‚Äù off the truck never to be seen again. The tracking info said ‚Äúon route to post office‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. That was December 2nd. It‚Äôs December 14th now and my husband is still without his new iPhone.

I spoke to a supervisor with Canada post and he didn‚Äôt seem to give a crap about what happened in all honesty. He called me 4 days after my service ticket had been submitted and said he received my service ticket I had put in for the lost item and said he would talk to the delivery person for more info and call me right back. He didn‚Äôt call me back. It took me THREE days to get ahold of him (I probably called 50+ times a day trying to catch him while he was in his office and left several voicemails!) and when I finally did get ahold of him, he basically said ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs lost. Fill out a claim and have Koodo send you out a new one‚Äù.

The supervisor also closed my ticket as ‚Äúresolved‚Äù without giving me a call to discuss anything. I found this out when I called the 1-866 number to see if there was anyone else that could contact me because he was too difficult to get ahold of!

Definitely seems super fishy to me. Especially how it just vanished off the truck never to be seen again but mine magically made its way to the post office for pick up the next day.

I‚Äôm disgusted because I honestly believe that my husbands phone was stolen by a Canada post worker. I cannot believe that an item would just vanish into thin air overnight to never be seen again. Definitely something weird going on here.

Koodo is sending out a new phone and launching an investigation into the matter. I hope they find out what truly happened to it and if it happens that someone did steal it, I hope they are found out and reprimanded for their actions."
The worst post. I do not know where is my parcel which includes passport. They do not answer phone calls. No way to talk with them.
"Horrible service, I was supposed to get my package 3 weeks ago and it's still not here."
"On Vancouver Island it takes more than 2 weeks to receive a card sent from a block from my home. Not just once, but repeatedly. First its sent to Vancouver, sorted, and then sent back to Vancouver Island. Does this really make sense? Is it any wonder we don't use the mail service like we used to?"
"How is it that a company the size of Canada Post only had one person at the counter during a visit there on a busy Friday before Christmas? One person was on a well-deserved break during my visit and a third staff member was not able to work that day. In such circumstances Canada Post needs to bring in a third person. It is absolutely ridiculous that they would allow for a reduced staff number so close to Christmas on a Friday. WIth postal rates already sky high, they need to do better. My hat actually goes off to the hardworking ladies who work this location. Canada Post - please give them the support they need and the service Canadians deserve!"
"Canada post has never once delivered a package on time or even a reasonable time after. It has gotten bad enough that I will pay $70 from a different company even when the option for free shipping from canada post is available. This department is a perfect example of why federal government is absolute trash, is this was a company like fed-ex or ups they would have been out of business years ago. The tracking function is just as useless as the workers who drive and sort the packages it‚Äôll tell you that it is in transit but not the stops until a day after it arrives and ships out to another facility. My point is don‚Äôt support this fuckup of a government program."
"Worst courier service ever. Over charge, tracking doesn't work, very late delivery, lost packages. I recommend you use more reliable couriers like FedEx or UPS."
"Disappointed with canada post , first off how difficult is it to scan an item at each location. When a person pays extra to get it tracked and you some how lose the item . As in the previous reviews, maybe Canada post should maybe take their customers complaints into consideration"
"Canada Post is the most unreliable postal service I've ever experienced, and I've delivered and received from almost every service. Their tracking is a joke - ""In-Transit"" Dec 7 (Mississauga), ""expected Delivery Dec 10"" (North York), but Dec 13 it was still ""In-Transit"" and now it says Expected Delivery Dec 17. DEC 17. And who knows if that's even true?

Is everybody okay?

So my expensive skincare is sitting in a hot/cold truck for 12 days?"
"The worst services in the world!! They just charge money !!!
I had a urgent parcel that sent it to USA ! They told it takes maximum 4 days with xpress post!!
Now it‚Äôs about 15 days that they haven‚Äôt receive my parcell!!
Not satisfied at all! You just charge people !!
SAD,BAD,MAD"
Canada post almost ruined another Christmas this year! First time it was a $200 gift card stolen from an envelope and the open letter still sent to me!?! Well we caught on this year and started sending certified checks and guess what?? this years envelope was torn open and I guess they noticed the check was not cashable so they sent us our ripped open envelope with the check in it! SHAME ON YOU CANADA POST FOR STEALING AND TRYING AGAIN TO RUIN ANOTHER CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR FOR TWO CHILDREN! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING you must have a Bunch of thieving grinches handling your mail.
"I'm happy with Canada Post I never have issues and always find them very helpful esp the offices. I would have given 4 star but recently they did bug me. For years I've lived in the same house and recieved the mail the same way. But now suddenly my 5 stairsteps that they had to climb to reach my mailbox on the deck became too slippery.

Two members showed up and told me that unless I bring the mail box down or put slipgaurd on the stairs, mails will not be delivered because in rain it becomes slippery. I immediately complied and put the slip gaurd same day.Then I recieved a pile of mails, it seemed as if they had already held my mails without giving me prior notice of any kind.

Then after a week or so they showed up again today, now 3 people. I was told that slip gaurds are not wide enough one can still slip from the stairs so I need to put one more strips on each of the steps. The story doesn't end there, after climbing the stairs, to reach the mailbox, one has to walk two more steps on the deck. I'm told that I have to also put wider asphalt sheet on the floor of my deck till the point where the mail box is because floor is also slippery in rain. There is no moss or anything on my wood yet it is slippery for them.

I think the main reason behind is the mail person is too old or lazy to climb the steps up and down.

If he/she could have simply requested respectfully to me the truth and confessed their desire, I would have loved to bring the mail box down to accommodate the need of the mail person. Because I have always respected their profession. But all this story has now brought their respect a notch down for me."
"Hard to believe a carrier service is this bad. Can we just get rid of Canada Post?

For some reason, they've decided to just stop delivering my packages. They arrive in my city, sit in the warehouse for a day, then get returned to sender without ever being out on the truck out for delivery.

I order 5 things from Amazon, 2 from Purolator arrived, 1 from FedEx arrived, the last 2 from Canada Post are both being returned to sender with no explanation given.

After calling Canada Post support, which is awful itself, the auto-awnswering computer tries so hard to get you to hang up, 5 mins in and your still listening to ""press 1 for... press 2 for.. did you know you can go online on our website?""... infuriating bad service. After being on hold for 40 minutes, I finally got ahold of someone and her answer was..... she doesn't know. Really? Great. ""Address conflict"" apparently and she says they are having difficulties determining my address. Which is surprising considering it's written in their face. So she continues to say she's not sure why they didn't out them on their truck but that due to being ""unable to determine your address"" they are being returned to send and there is nothing they can do.

So Canada Posts official ""solution"" is to wait for my package to be returned to sender, wait for my refund and then buy the products again (which doesn't help cause I bought them on sale) and I guess hope that they deliver it this time or hope that Amazon doesn't ship it Canada Post (please Amazon let us choose, I'll pay extra).

Canada Post: A Disgrace to Canada."
"DO TRAINING TO YOUR STAFF!!!
Last week I send Christmas cards to Europe, I wrote the address on the envelopes together with the girl that works there. And guess what? I received my cards back after one week. I went today to find out what happened, and I was told that this could be because the address of the sender and receiver were mixed up. Really??!!!??? Ok.
I tried again, bought new envelopes, wrote the address, and the girl told me a double price than I paid initially, saying that maybe because the cards are oversized they were sent back - even though I paid the amount I was told!!!!!
This is not normal!!!!
-I paid the price that was asked for a service that I didn't receive!
-""MAYBE"" is not an answer!
-Different prices on different days for the same Christmas card?"
"This has become a rotten delivery company over the last year or so. Some deliverymen don't bother making the delivery. They just drop it off straight at a pick-up point. I've contacted Canada Post on the phone several times, but nothing seems to be changing. And I live near downtown, Toronto, where the volume of mail is high. Service is getting worse every year, and no one seems to be doing anything about it no matter how many people complain."
"I'm a bit in shock to be honest. I'm from Mexico and am used to terrible service but how service this bad is possible is beyond me! I ordered my package well ahead of time because I knew I'd be flying into montreal for a short trip. My package was delayed and until today has still not arrived. My flight back is tomorrow morning. When I called customer service I explained : I don't live here. I fly home tomorrow morning. Please help. Response: we will keep monitoring and if you still haven't received it by the 18th we will contact you to let you know what to do next. Poor girl.

My other option was to have someone else pick up the package for me. Who? Who knows! But I better give them a signed letter and they better have government ID. Then, she kindly added, they can ship it to you in Mexico. At your own expense of course.

So I guess I have to pay for their mistake on top of paying for expedited shipping that obviously means nothing to the company. I agree with other reviewers. If they can't deliver expedited shipping shouldn't even be an option! I hope companies like amazon and sephora stop using them. I'd rather pay 50 dollars for fedex or ups tbh!"
Don't you love it when Canada Post send you an update about your item. Nothing happened to be updated but I got an email saying that it was updated the only thing that has happened is on each day says in transit. It's been in transit for 6 days now. Guaranteed delivery date tomorrow which is a joke is supposed to been here since the 7th of December. If you can't do a delivery on time don't take extra money for the delivery
"I HATE HATE HATE canada post, I was so mad that they actually had the audacity to go on strike. They've lost my packages, charged me excessive customs for doing nothing, opened MANY SEALED COLLECTIBLES MAKING THEM WORTHLESS, given me those ******NG delivery slips on my door, at times when I was AT HOME WAITING for the item, because they are too damn lazy to even knock, they've left valuable parcels laying not on my porch even but on the SIDE DOOR. I could write a ******NG book about how ****** Canada Post is just on my personal experiences alone. But I am powerless to do anything. All I get is endless holding on the phone, emails that don't get answered, BS apologies, and worthless low level employees who can barely read their regurgitated responses to me out of a handbook. Disgusting company. I try to avoid Canada Post AT ANY AND ALL COSTS, no matter how much more UPS or FedEx costs, no matter how many BS fees they have, I will NEVER EVER use Canada Post if I can help it."
Can't believe they made a delivery accident and won't take any responsibility for that... Got my delivery notice card on Monday and went to pick up my parcel on Tuesday twice to hear my parcel got delivered to the wrong location and then don't know where it is. Called agent and all he said was sit and wait. Now I don't know how long it will take me to receive my parcel.
"I get that its busy around Christmas but the tracker isnt even working, the support is useless, I cant even get a refund because I had to spent and hour finding out the senders address and then make an account and a new support ticket because you cant view it unless you have one, just to find out that canada post says the address is wrong or something its ridiculous if I could at least know my mail was delayed by a few days a week it would be easy but I dont know anything."
They side my pakage is delivered but nothing I got?!
my phone still hasn't come. it was supposed to be delivered a week ago and still nothing. I'm convinced that those thieves stole what I worked so hard to get. my 1000 dollar pixel 4 hasn't come past date and what?I'm not supposed to be suspicious? I'm a high school student working at McDonald's who has been living with a hardly functional blackberry for years. I earned what I paid for and expect to get it without the fear that lazy workers are not getting the job done right.
"Shortly, I got scammed and I figured it out 10 minutes after I handed the shipment over to Canada Post. Got back after two minutes, package was already on its way. In one hour, as instructed I provided them with Fraud case and Police report numbers with the description of the package (a big Fedex box which is a lot different than a lot of other boxes)and they initiated the process to intercept the package. Package was still in transit to Missasauga when they started the ticket and was sent to Surrey, BC. It went thorigh four scans in four different places. They said thay they were going to intercept it in Surrey. In the end, it was delivered. Canada Post could NOT stop the package from being delivered in four days. When I called them to ask about it, they said it was delivered although they tried to intercept it. The tone was like, oh we would either lose it or deliver it, but wouldn‚Äôt probably intercept it anyways. Absolute disaster. Don‚Äôt know why they are in business. Shame. I thought it was a joke when I saw that it was delivered. Be extremely careful and avoid sending important document/high value items."
"The worst service I have ever had, please hire more people instead of cutting jobs and make the public suffer.keep in mind it is paid services.please just privatized the company and let us have a good service already."
Extremely bad. Their tracking system is a big mess and needs to be fixed. I need to keep refreshing the page to finally get an updated tracking status of my parcel. Also delivery time is always delayed. ALWAYS!
I used to be very cynical about Canada Post. Continually not understanding just how hard mail persons work at least in my area and also the sorting plant 149st. Edmonton. My mailman has continually gone above and beyond to get mail delivered on time. The winters in Edmonton are harsh but he never begrudges carrying large packages to addresses rather just takes it all in stride smiling as he delivers. Many many times pre Christmas it is not unusual to see postal people delivering after 8:00 p.m. This is a job not for the faint of heart . It seems to be tedious and back breaking. I for one am amazed how the mail gets sorted so quickly and delivered in a timely manner.
"I sent a pre-paid parcel box with a 1-3 day delivery window from Edmonton to Vancouver. It has been 8 days and it sat in Richmond for 5 days, went to Vancouver where they posted a routing error and sent it back to Richmond where it still sits. I opened a service ticket which said they would investigate in 15 days. Useless. Last time I use this service."
Canada Post rating is so so bad.. It don't even deserve one star
"I havent called Canada Post in years. So, I tried the online Chat. I was set up with a tech named Chris, who had no idea what he was doing. I have to pull answers from him. He was rude, useless, and didnt know what he was doing.

When I asked if I could talk with someone who could help. He said ""good bye"" and disconnected the call willingly."
"Unfortunately I have to give a star
Would like to give no stars
Canada post didn't deliver or even knock or ring door as a result 2 parcel missing
Won't look into the matter past 3 days

Separate complaint mail deliveree
Took my signature and ran away only to come back and later deliver 2 envelopes ??"
"DO NOT post your complaints on here or on the Canada Post Facebook page, it doesn't do a thing and nothing will change.

Instead email someone who can be held accountable by voters. The Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada, Anita Anand, is the one in charge of overseeing Canada Post and her email can be found by Googling her department. (Sorry this website doesn't allow me to post links or email)."
"Imagine havjng your tracking number update on friday letting you know your package is in town and should be delivered that day... its not monday and when I went to pick it up I was informed it was placed on a delivery truck, since I needed to package I didnt mind waiting arond but by the time 6pm came around I knew that I wasnt going to be seeing it.

My question is if you arent going to bloody deliver my parcel, why take it on the bloody truck with you, your wasting my time and making your company look awful. Not to mention there was a drizzle of rain and I doubt the lady wanted to walk 15 feet and get her hair a little bloody wet. So much for ""in rain, sleet and snow"" now its ""we srop at a drizzle""

Get bent, if you werent a goverbemnt organisation forced on us you would have been replaced long ago by a far superior service not to mrntion it wouldnt be funded by our tax dollars and hosting annual strikes."
"Waiting for three packages, all over due by at least three days. Tracking is "" unavailable due to high volume "" , how stupid are they , it is Christmas, is it a surprise that there would be a high volume."
"Horrible!!!
I ordered my on tje 25th of bloody November! It was expected to be delivered on the 6th of December.. it's the 9th end of day and nothing has arrived hate how I ordered 5 things and there was no other choice but Canada Post, here's an advice.. DO NOT CHOOSE CANADA POST IF YOU'RE NOT FORCED ON IT!! this company should be shut down.. thieves that's what they are.."
"I knew I was F**ked when I saw my parcel was being delivered by Canada post. Not Purolator, FedEx, UPS. Amazon is either really cheap or they're just f***g with me by giving me the worst courier. Mississauga to Mississauga delivery takes at least 8 days? Bull crap. I can pick it up at 3 hrs tops in Mississauga. They need 8 days? Come on. My dog could pick up parcels faster. Amazon should have given me a choice to avoid Canada post... Unlucky, would have paid extra. Oh yeah did I mention it was expresspost? Meaning top priority?"
"Delivery standard passed a week ago, no update online (other than expected delivery of 3 days ago).

No recourse other than to write a service ticket which won't be answered for a minimum of a week; online help service just says 'open a ticket'; and trying to call them will have you wait up to an hour just for them to say 'not sure, open a ticket'.

If this were a private company they'd be out of business."
Canada Post will not can not and have no other means to help you if you do not have a tracking # but have no problem signing your name one the digital document which last time I checked is illegal to do and then claimed it was sent back after I show up in person to 28 topple drive distribution center burnside Canada post. They stole $600.00 worth of Christmas items . When I contacted the official head office in Ontario they said the same thing over and over it was not there problem and they wouldn't do anything for me. I hung up after being escalated and have been waiting for 2 hours like what the flying fork. When I contacted the company I ordered from they said I signed for the items but was told it was sent back from all 3 individuals at the desk . Do not ship your loved ones Christmas items through Canada post as they are thieves.
Never once did my package arrive on time... paying extra for faster service is a rip-off! You can plan to change your plans with Canada post. F You guys!
I do everything I can to never have to use Canada post. They never scan items on time so tracking numbers are useless. Delivery dates are never met. They are the worst courier service out there. I do alot of online shopping and will actually pay more to not use canada post.
F*****((**((((((CK WERE IS MY PACKAGEEESSSSSS
This useless useless services must be shut down to void losing more Government money and wasting peoples times.
"Living in England with family in Canada for 15 years has demonstrated Canada Postal service is the worst in the world! It can take up to 2 weeks for a letter or worse, a birthday card, & anything up to a month for a parcel! What is it with Canada! Why is their postal service this bad????? I have actually demonstrated this - I sent a Christmas card to a friend in Canada & a Christmas card to her daughter in The USA! The US one arrived with 3 days! The Canadian one has yet to arrive! Nearly 10 days now. Dreadful!"
"Never again, three missed dates after calling for the same package I am discouraged and the tracking number Keeps indicating the past date. Same for two other packages that Imam waiting for, these have been delayed but at least these were updated before the actual date. I don‚Äôt understand how all other shippers when I purchasing from amazon or spot on. Very sad."
"Although my parcel is late, I spoke with a very helpful representative, and I know where my package is."
Canada post at this time of the year is the worst carrier you can choose as package from ont to sk takes over a week that is at worst a 3 day trip canada post sucks
"I HATE Canada post! The WORST freight carrier! Waiting on 3 packages, they were delivered using the fastest shipping method, it's been over a week and it's still not here! Expected delivery was Friday for all 3 packages and they never came! Now I have to wait another week! This is not the first time this has happened and half the time they never mark packages as delivered!

Also, how the hell does it take over a week to ship WITHIN Canada?! Amazon manages to ship within 1-2 days! Canada post is a disgrace and an embarrassment to Canada let alone a big joke!

STEP IT UP! I cannot express my anger enough with this God awful postal service!"
"The most unreliable and slowest freight carrier!!!!!

Never on time - NEVER"
The absolute worst shipping service in the world!! They charge enormous fee's for shipping and they can't even deliver in time!! They know that the volume of packages increases during the holiday season and yet they can't even anticipate it or even hire more employees to deliver. Whoever is running things down there are all a bunch a buffoons!!
"The day this company folds is when the massive celebration starts. Absolutely terrible service. Package has been ""in transit"" from montreal for 4 days to Ontario.. Uhm what... What is the point of having a tracker available to see where your product is when they shut it off because it will be late... I'd be embarrassed to say I work for CP. If we don't do our job we get fired, so they must get promoted for it.. Thousands and thousands of negative reviews how hasn't anyone looked into this fraudulent company... Just saw on ctv that in barrie ontario canada post delivery driver caught not making deliveries and just placing notice on door! Great job."
"Paid for expedited delivery (2 days)
Shipment was picked up at Canada Post centre in Mississauga within a day from when I placed my order, 10 days later it's still in transit to my house in Toronto. What are they doing with my package for so long? It's past the expected delivery AND 'delivery standard' and there haven't been any updates on my package. Horrible service, I shouldn't have even had to pay for expedited shipping if it was going to take so long."
"Extremely POOR service.

A package was sent from Calgary to Toronto
Sent >> Nov 29th
Arrived in Mississauga >> Dec 2nd
Not delivered to Toronto East after 6 days it arrived in Mississauga.

My question is what are they doing with the package in Mississauga for so long ?? 10 days delivery is unacceptable to say the least. (don't even know if it would be delivered on 9th)"
"Sent an urgent package on Dec 5, 2019 to Niagara-on-the-Lake from Toronto on next day delivery. Today is Dec 7, 2019, and it was not delivered. When inquired about it the woman at the postal outlet lied and tried to tell me that it was delivered. When pressed, admitted that it was in Stoney Creek facility and that she can't do anything about its delivery!
Lesson well learned!
Never ever use Canada Post, and don't trust their promises! Use few more additional Dollars and use a private carrier if you need a reliable service!"
"Purchased 2 separate items on the web. Both were routed via Canada Post. Order dates on both Dec 1, still waiting for delivery.
CP tracking site appears overwhelmed and either crashes or asks to use it later.
The WORST service. This effects both sellers and buyers, both parties using CP services.
Amazon is looking much more attractive..."
"CP sucks !, I had a parcel shipped from Brampton Ont. one and half hrs away from me ! On Nov 29.
The tracking won‚Äôt update, my parcel is still showing at the post office in Brampton !
It was to be delivered on Thursday Dec 5. Today is the 7 th and still no parcel ! And no updates ! Still showing at the post office in Brampton !, where the heck is my package CP ? !
And when I call they blame it on the holidays of course. And I have to wait TIL the 12 th and if not still delivered then they go to the second step ! Like really !, Is it that damn complicated to scan the package ?
I‚Äôm over the moon discussed with CP ! They are a crap show for sure !"
Do Not Pay for Express Shipping. I paid $27.00 for a card to be shipped in 2 days to the US. It has been a week and the tracking status indicates it is not more than 50km from its original location. I'm honestly not going to consider using Canada Post again.
Terrible service. Ordered two items 3 days apart about 1.5 weeks ago. First item was supposed to be here 2 days ago but still hasn't arrived and second item was supposed to be here on Friday but I got nothing. Since they dont deliver on weekends I'm out of luck until next week. I ordered an item 5 days ago and it was shipped out for delivery 2 days ago and it's being shipped by Purolator and it looks like its going to arrive before the CP items.
Package not delivered by due date. Tracking number shows expected delivery date but I didn't get it. Service and tracking info is not reliable and very poor...
"Bought an item from the Source. Tracking says parcel delivered to community box. I checked, and it was empty. I call and logged a ticket. The issue was resolved the next business day after I called to complain. Everyone is happy."
Canada Post sucks. Took them 6 days to delivery my parcel from Burnaby to Calgary. A mule delivery would have been much faster. The parcel went from Burnaby to Edmonton then to Calgary. If I want to fly from Vancouver to Calgary I would fly from Vancouver to Calgary. Why would I want to fly to Edmonton then to Calgary. What incompetency. It should be privatized. Get rid of all the workers.
"Canada Post is absolutely horrendous. I received my final notice 1 1/2 WEEKS after it is already been sent back! And there were no initial notice as well. The package was international and when given the tracking number, they just cannot locate the package at all!
When calling the customer service, they tried hard to palm off their responsibilities by claiming being ""busy"". Good luck with opening a ticket with them because nothing will be done or addressed in the end. The representative gives me this ""yeah we made the mistake, but we can't do anything about it or compensate you in anyway, so too bad"" attitude. If you want something done right, might as well pay a bit extra and use UPS and others."
"Canada post sucks. I've been waiting for a delivery within the city for days. Stupid tracking still says item processed in mississauga.
Is it that hard to deliver a box.
C'mon man.."
"I feel the need to warn every Canadian in every Province that if your tracking thing says ""delivered"" but it obviously hasn't been, don't panic! I had this happen to me and I called and explained everything and put in a service ticket or whatever they call it and it magically showed up the next day in my mailbox the .. I wasn't impressed but I understand that stuff happens ( I can't blame them for laziness or losing the package because I don't have any proof) and the lady on the phone was really nice. Also don't wait up all night for them to deliver on the scheduled delivery date, just go about your day because it probably won't show up. I was supposed to get my package on wednesday and didn't see it until today ( Friday) so if you're in a hurry, don't wait until the last minute to ship!"
"Trash Service. Said my package was out for delivery on Dec 2, it's now end of Dec 6. What an unreliable service, and the sender paid for express delivery. These bozos can even locate the package. I've had service in the US and the postal service there is impeccable. Delivery even on Saturdays and Sundays. Bloody unionized government workers are so damn lazy. Hello!!! you are being overpaid to do your job!!! Dynamex, UPS and FedEx are the way to go. You can't count on Canada Post to move their asses!"
"Canada post is awful! I order something from Montreal usual takes 2-3 days I‚Äôve been wait 7 days still no delivery! The website says it‚Äôs still in Montreal and it will be delivered today, but the tracking has not updated in 4 days. I‚Äôve had fedex and amazon packages showing up all week. What a horrible delivery service! DONT ever make the mistake of going with Canada post ! they will let you down every time !"
"Canada post service is not trustable, I was supposed to received my parcel on 3 dec by end of day. Then next day that updated to 4 Dec but disnt received it. Today is 6 Dec 2019 but still no hope .
I felt so sorry for my daughter who i promise a gift from best buy that never reach through Canada post. I give zero points to canada post service."
"Waiting for an item that was shipped on Saturday November 30th from BC to Alberta. It only took a whole 6 business days to travel one province over. The item gets scanned as ""out for delivery"" only to be changed to ""item rescheduled for delivery next business day"". The item is already two days late to begin with. This is the second time in the same week this has happened to one of my packages. I guess the lazy delivery driver had ""too many"" packages to deliver. Three of my other packages have also been delayed this week. Still not delivered as of yet. These people make excuses for having high holiday volumes. I see couriers like Intelcom, Dynamex, and UPS not having any issues delivering their packages on time, even with the surplus amount of parcels. These tools will make excuses for their lazy, disorganized, pathetic work ethic. A complete and utter disgrace to the name of our country. Maybe if they weren't so stingy and parsimonious with overtime pay, then these parcels would get sorted and delivered in a timely manner. What an epic failure this company is. Please retire and fold once and for all!"
Keep it simple. Canada Post needs to fold. Tear it down. Another plan needs to be put in place. CP is still in the stone ages. Can't deliver a package if the world Depended on it. Out dated and CP dont give a rats a$$ about it. You cant complain because nobody does a thing about it.
If I tied my mail to a bird it would have a better chance of getting to its destination then using Canada Post services
"If I could give it -1000000 stars I would. Canada Post is the worst shipping company out there. They have no clue how to manage logistics efficiently. They do not update their tracking information and blame the holiday season for delays as if they didn't plan for it. This is a reactive company, not a proactive company and thus cannot even problem solve accordingly. Unfortunately the vendor I deal with had to deal with Canada Post and as a result, CP does not know where my package is. Crown corporations like Canada Post are the worst. They don't want to get with the times. They don't deliver on weekends, when other companies deliver on weekends and provide much better service and more accurate updates. Canada Post needs a major restructuring - mainly focusing on improving customer service and improving logistics. If they worked on weekends during peak seasons, then maybe they wouldn't run into this problem every year and re-gain the trust of Canadians.

Update: I finally received my package, 4 days after the standard delivery date. And of course the item was damaged by CP. Abysmal service. Shameful this is a crown corporation. A complete and utter disgrace to the Canadian economy."
"Dec 6th 2019
I just want to give a positive shoutout to Canada Post Express Post
The driver was so polite and was early in the say dropping of my package. Thank you so much :) I hope the driver that came to my house today gets recognized for such a great job he did and how he made my day :)


Tabitha Champagne"
idk man I ain't from Canada but my snigga gwo don't like em so I don't either
"Absolutely awful service. My package was supposed to be delivered either yesterday or today. As you can guess, it did not arrive on either of those days. I talked to one of the people at CP and was told that the package is still at their distribution center and was not even put on a delivery truck! So then why the hell was the delivery date not updated to reflect that it would most certainly not be arriving today? I didn't leave the house all day because I didn't want to miss the delivery. And naturally they could not guarantee that my package would be delivered tomorrow either, or even give me an estimate on what time they will come. So unless I want to wait even longer and have to pick the package up myself, I have to be at home and available all day tomorrow from 9AM and 8PM and hope they actually show up. Which is ridiculous. Two whole days wasted because they are useless.

I will also be contacting the company that sent the package to complain and will let them know I will not purchase from them again as long as they use CP."
"If I COULD rate them ZERO or -100 , I would, its their second time sending my packages to someone else house and thank god I god lucky my community is great and the people who received it brought it to my house, I don't know why is SO HARD TO READ THE ADDRESS PROPERLY HONESTLY, so SICK of their bad service."
"545 Steeles Ave W, Brampton, ON L6Y 4C0 rexall location , both the ladies working in morning shift Don't know how to serve customer, even they don't know procedure of receiving parcel pick up and they don't know whether they have fax machine on site or not. First of all, they were rude, racist and made me four times to visit for my parcel pickup. In short they don't want to give, even those I got call for pickup from that location. When old gentleman was giving me my parcel so was telling not to give however that gentleman did his duty properly. In my opinion they should not work . Everytime they were making excuse bring this and that . Totally bad experience . I am thankful to that gentleman for helping me out."
"They never deliver, they just leave a notice on the door even when you are home. They don't even ring the door bell. Then you have to wait 1-2 days for some reason just to pick it up at the post office. Even after 2 days of waiting they will tell you they might lost the package or they did not receive it yet. Anything is better than canada post. They are a joke"
"You guys are a joke, delay after delay after delay. Reconsider your career choice please."
"You will pay for a service you will not receive and will be given every excuse available under the sun as to why they cannot fulfill their engagement. You will wait 20-25 minutes to talk to a representative and it will take over 4 hours to ""maybe"" get a call back from a supervisor only to tell you rudely what you already knew, that they will not fulfill their engagements with regards to you, the customer. And then they dare to go on strike for better working conditions? Please.... I contacted the company with whom I did business and got my Xpresspost fee refunded. Use UPS or FedEX instead."
"Absolute garbage. I can't buy anything online anymore because there's only about a 50% chance that I'll actually end up receiving it. I've had over a dozen packages go missing (most of them were TRACKED), and I've had other people's mail dumped on my doorstep more times than I can count. Canada Post needs to stop hiring kindergarten dropouts to deliver our mail. Maybe they should start hiring chimps instead, they'd certainly do a better job!"
"I was at home waiting for a package to arrive by express post. The tracking order said it would be here on December 4/2019, but it did not arrive then.

I checked the tracking order again at 12:30 pm on December 5/2019 and it said that a delivery notice was left for me in my mailbox at 11:45 am. I was home and the delivery person made no attempt to contact me.

If they would have tried to buzz me at my apartment, my phone would have rung, but it didn't.

I went down to my mailbox and looked at the notice and it told me that I was to pick it up at my local Post office, the next day after 1300 hours. Customer service kept me on hold for 47 minutes while they tried to get a hold of a supervisor.

The woman I spoke with was understanding and tried to appease me, but when I said I would be leaving a negative review on line she said that I would need to speak with a supervisor because I made a ""media threat"". I waited further and finally I was told that someone could contact me in 4 hours to take my complaint.

Needless to say I could not be bothered to wait around for a ""supervisor"" from the sorting plant to contact me. I know they would make excuses and rationalize why they could not make this right.

If this was the first time that this had happened then I would let it slide, but it has happened three times to me over the years. nothing gets done about it and the poor customer service continues.

I will contact the company I placed an order with and tell them I will no longer order things from them online until they hire a more reliable and professional delivery company.

Canada Post either you deliver packages when you say you are going to, or just tell us up front that we have to pick up packages at the nearest post office, but quit making excuses all the time for your ineptitude."
"use literally any other shipping company. Package lost after paying for express. An entirely useless customer service team that is trained to just say ""sorry"". 2 weeks needed to hold an ""investigation"". (Guess what? In two weeks, the package is untraceable,). You might as well say ""ok, better luck next time, we are doing nothing at all for you"".
The online tracker is terrible. Even when you finally get a hold of someone on the phone, they use tactics like putting you on hold for a long period of time and then saying ""sir, sir, can you hear me? There must be a technical error. Please call back"". YOU JUST TOOK MY PHONE NUMBER, CALL ME BACK?!?!?!?! I am genuinely embarrassed for using Canada Post... hope whoever stole my package enjoys their spoils!"
"""We try our hardest to correct any address errors""
Haha, what a joke. I wrote ""121st st"" instead of ""121 st"" on my shipping address, the package came all the way to vancouver from new york. The package was in my neighborhood, on my street... but no, because they can't figure out what ""st"" means, it has to go all the way back to new york for a wrong adress. What a joke.
All support lines were closed, chat didn't work, phone line hung up on me, and email never responded. Their FAQ is a joke.
Thanks for nothing, Canada Post."
"What a joke our national post service is. I just spent 25 minutes on the phone getting through to Canada Post.
Funny thing is throughout the call a message kept repeating to try the online chat feature, when I did, chat did not work.
Anyway, after 25 minutes of waiting the gentleman who answered, could not tell me where my package was just that it was 3 days overdue. He kept apologizing, but no answers.
Put another way, it is the year 2019, Canada Post cannot tell you where your package is between Mississauga and Waterloo, they cannot tell you why it is 3 days overdue. I repeat it's 2019 !!!
It is beyond my comprehension why anyone in this day and age would ship with Canada Post.
I just keep hearing the gentleman on the end of the phone saying sorry, I apologize .....sad when apologies are meaningless and empty."
Your tracking service is terrible. I get packages all the time shipped in the USA. They update everyday. Your service never updates. Learn a lesson from a successful operation. And guess what. Packages even move on Sunday. Time to get into the real world or close down.
"I've had a couple packages delivered a day later than initially predicted, but I've had just as many come several days early. When they were going to be late, the delivery information could be easily found using the tracking number. Deliveries that predict 2-5 business days are often here in 2. Packages come in good condition, delivery people hand them to you in person."
Horrible service. They can‚Äôt deliver ur item on time trust ups they‚Äôre better.
"Will do everything in their power to make sure Canadian businesses are not competitive in the e-commerce economy (even within Canada). Rates twice as expensive as the United States, and almost guaranteed shipping delays for no apparent reason.

Nobody who works there cares at all about their customers. Really a national disgrace and a bane to our economy. Especially moving into the future with more commerce done online, only the big players will be able to afford to ship within reasonable times.

So glad their average score on here actually truthfully reflects their quality and the amount they care about their customers!"
"Expedited Parcel from Stoney Creek, ON to Brampton, ON still not delivered it's been five days now. Status showing Item in transit."
"Order a item off amazon with prime, fast delivery to my city, sat in canada post warehouse for 4 days before attempting delievery. Called they told me because it snowing there pulling the truck due to weather conditions....
If they cant deliever because it snowing less than 5cm they should close up shop and move to Florida.
Garbage a** company, only company in the city who crying about a bit of snow. You know the company have trash employee when the school buses are running and they cant"
"Very unreliable letter-mail delivery. I will only post at a service outlet, since I have regularly had mail posted in street mail boxes, both regular and their super boxes, go missing and never arrive at the destination. Expected mail posted to us has also regularly gone missing. Missing cheques are especially problematic and costly. he At my office, I'm always getting other people's mail. It might even be addressed to someone in a different city with the same street name, or simply properly addressed but delivered to the wrong address! It's no wonder people use their service less and less. On the flip side at home in the country, the regular mail driver has yet to deliver us someone else's mail. However, expected mail often hasn't arrived. For regular letter-mail delivery, I wouldn't trust them and will avoid using the service wherever possible."
"Always delayed from what they say expected delivery !! Whenever I see something being posted by Canada post I get upset, as they are never on time !!! And usually not according to tracking information !!"
"So apparently Canada Post sent out a message to their warehouses telling them to ship packages back to the sender early around November 22nd 2019(explained to me by an employee at my local post office after I inquired why I had not received my package). When I called CS, they told me my package got sent back because the vendor didn't put my house address on the package which I completely disbelieve now. I shouldn't get my hopes up with another completely useless Canadian government service. They should be the ones paying for my delivery, which I covered from the vendor."
Garbage Canada post. They destroyed my whole mail package. They even delivered (courier) that to the receiver in the same condition 15 days later and misplaced my important documents. The receiver returned that package. USELESS CANADA POST
Absolute garbage. At every single department. Should be closed. Absolutely every single delivery company out there surpasses these clowns and cost less.
"Place is a joke, customer service is horrible, employees are over paid, and need attitude adjustments"
"I had a package that usually held at post office. This time was not case they decided to deliver it to me but i was not home, and someone else signed for it. i always have to show id at post office so what makes it different when they come to an apartment building and there is 10 different apts here and any one could walk out the door take my package. PROOF OF RESIDENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED."
"This company is the absolute worst. Customer service is horrendous, packages are always late. They have just lost 600 dollars worth of tropical plants and refuse to acknowledge it and to top it off were extremely rude. From now on I will take my business elsewhere. Purolator is just as cheap and packages arrive in a day or two compared to two weeks when you pay for the express with Canada post. I‚Äôm extremely fed up."
Just hate canadapost service. Even we cant get parcel if we have done expresspost. Rude people working here. I cant get my parcel even when its shows that its in my city. And its my passport and i have flight after 6 hrs
"What a joke ive been waiting for nearly 2 weeks for my insurance claims cheque to arrive from Vancouver to the okanagan it is now December 2 and no cheque, like did you guys put it in the wrong mail box or something. There is no reason why a cheque mail from Vancouver should take this long. I know you have put other peoples mail in the wrong boxes, do you guys not pay attention because your stupid mailing service i now am behind on all my bills."
"Literally a scam. Why does it still exist? The worst courier in Canada ironically has ""Canada"" in its name. What a shame. Never delivers on time. Stupid and rude customer service. They don't even deliver to your address anymore. I have to go to the post office downtown every single time to pick up my mails. I wish DONALD TRUMP was the President of Canada so he could shut this stupid company down."
horrible service horrible rude workers cant even explain things right . they cant even fix thier own mistakes . this service is a scam
Its sad but I‚Äôm 100% done now. I dont care if my package is worth 5 cents. I will spend upwards of 100$ to ship with another carrier. They are incompetent. They are slow. They do not care. There is nothing you can do if you are disappointed in the service; and it‚Äôs designed that way.
"Horrible.

My bridal shower invites had to be sent out TWICE. The first batch was lost in the mail from a mailbox in Mississauga. Now our wedding THANK-YOUS have been lost as well and we will again need to pay and re send them! Beyond unhappy with the mail delivery. We have now had to pay for invites, thank you‚Äôs and postage TWICE."
"Most disgusting company I've ever come across. Received a notice that my package was delivered to post office when I go to the post office with the notice they say it's not there, item can't be found. I called customer service, they opened a ticket. Ticket was made november 18th, it is now December 1st and i hear nothing back about my package!!!! Now i sent email to get a copy of my ticket and it's taking 10 days to be sent the ticket?! Wth is going on!!!"
I ordered a package on the November 21 from Alberta to Nova Scotia and the order said it was supposed to arrive on the 23....its now December 1st
"No mail or intermittent mail for weeks since we got a new mailman. Run a small business. Cheques and other important documents not being delivered. Complained almost two weeks ago. No response. Another over inflated, incompetent government agency which does not care about the customers paying their salaries. Disgraceful"
"I have a terrible experience dealing with a Canada post employee today. I receive email notify me my package is ready for pickup at post office around noon yesterday, I went to the post office to pickup my package this morning , To be told that someone already pickup my package the same evening my package arrived , It's a signature required pickup, they need you to show government issued ID with name and address , The person who pick up my package on their record has a completely different name and I have no idea how that person has ID with my address on. I am the original owner of my house , no one else ever live at this address other than my family we at lease one same name on our ID. The clerk was very rude she would not let me ask question, after checking her computer , give me a canada post phone number and told me that you have to call the number ,she can not help. I ask how you suppose to release a package to someone with a complete different name than the receiver, she say will any one with the same address can pick up, but the signature and name was a woman, I am the only female in my address all other family member at our address are men it's impossible for an other woman other than me to have ID showing my address.
I doubt 99% the Canada employee mistakenly release the wrong package to the other customer . If it was a theft why they not
create fake ID with my name and address instead of use a different name to sign off my package. I opp to have my package delivery to Canada post instead of my home , thinking it should be more secure. This was terrible spend a half day calling around Canada post , the sender and Canada post hangup my call before I finish taking."
I have never had one good story to share about a Canada Post service. I wish Amazon stop using their service.
"My favorite supplier for my business uses Canada Post unfortunately and they have not once managed a successful delivery despite simple instructions. In fact my coworkers on more than one occasion have seen the driver stop and put a notification on the door without any attempt to deliver the package. I suppose there are no repercussions or incentive for drivers who don't do the job that they are paid to do. If you have the option, do not use Canada Post!"
"They don't even attempt to deliver packages.

I live in an apartment and always include my buzzer number in the instructions so they don't need to look it up in the directory. I try to make it as easy as possible for delivery. However, Canada Post never even attempts to buzz. Instead, I always find a slip on the lobby door stating it's been dropped off at the postal office. No other shipping company does this. I try to avoid Canada Post when possible."
"Delivery preference is a joke, don't bother using it you'll only receive a ticket. They don't even deliver to your door, they give you tickets so you can grab your items yourself...."
Canada Post is a nightmare. Every other package of our clients gets lost or delayed or undelivered. I have never seen a postal service of such poor quality.
after 3 hours could still not pay for shipment on line. tried online support as well as phone-no luck whatsoever!!!
"Lost parcels, delivery notices that they claim are left behind and they are nowhere to be found and no email notice that item is out for delivery even though I requested it. Also at times, when I request for the package to be left behind, they don't leave it behind and it's a huge box that I do not want to carry back from the post office - I don't drive. It's a drag when you want and pay for something to be delivered and end up picking it up, no?!"
"lost parcel
Canada Post lost my parcel and say they cannot do anything to help. I not only paid for the products lost, but I paid for the delivery service and they received neither. TERRIBLE customer service, DO NOT trust them to do their job. If they are delivering your parcel, I strongly advise you to find an alternative. They will steal your money."
"bad, all the way.

A crown corporation. more toilet crown...

- delivery people are useless, cannot walk 10 meters and bang on the door to deliver 9their job)
- people at the post office are lazy as hell, you understand too many parcels we cannot find it.
- the website is full of useless stuff

Burn this thing to the ground!!!!"
"I normally don't ever write reviews and haven't had any issues before with this company but today was something special. I had ordered an item and recieved a final notice from Canada post BEFORE I had a delivery notice. I went to pick it up with my final notice earlier this week but they had already sent back the item. I checked my mailbox yesterday and saw there was a delivery notice and went back again today with that notice and they said it was the same item and already had been sent back. I told them the situation of what I mentioned just above. I had intentionally rude customer service from a young boy working there, who kept telling me that me recieving a final notice before a delivery notice was not possible, repeatedly. He didn't want to help me otherwise. I asked for a customer service # and spoke to them but they did not help me either because they cannot release personal info, which I understand, but when it is not my fault that I recieve a final notice BEFORE a delivery notice I'd expect more help than an apology which does nothing. I had no idea which item it was and now I'm not sure if I'll even get my money back. I have now contacted the company I think it is from, in hopes it is them. FYI I know what I recieved in my mailbox when I checked it."
"I had a important international mail sent to by my mother but the address was incomplete so I tracked the mail and phoned Canada Post every single day after it was sent so that I could correct the incomplete address and have it delivered to me. They told me that if the address is wrong or incomplete, the mail will be sent back to the sender which is understandable IF the receiver didn't make a claim or tracked the package. But I have been tracking it and letting them know that the address is incomplete and asked them multiple times not to send the package back. Even went to the processing office in Cloverdale but the office was already closed at 2pm, which by the way I was told by the supervisor that they're open till 3:30pm (talk about mis-informing clients), . The customer service wasn't helpful at all nor the supervisors. I searched for wrong or incomplete address policy on their website.
The website says:
""The delivery address was wrong or incomplete:
We deliver items as addressed and will make every attempt to correct any addressing issues.""
They didn't make attempt to call me (my phone number was written on the envelope) to correct the addressing issue. The only information that they can provide me is that it's been processed and will be sent back to the sender and that there's nothing that they can do. Very upsetting, pathetic service. They don't even deserve a bad star because they're that terrible."
Be very careful of returning an item to China. Canada Post charges about four times the normal cost and you are not likely to recover such an outrageous amount. I've just been stuck with a loss of about CAD$65. on a returned item worth about $30. Clearly the Crown Corp thinks it's punishing someone for something and has the right to do that.
"Ordered a package got off work early to be at home when the package came, was in the room beside my door walked out of the room and there was a notice sign... the driver didn‚Äôt even knock or ring my doorbell just left the note some Canadian company this is wish I didn‚Äôt need to use them again"
"They are intentionally providing as poor of service as possible since their most recent strike. They never use their own tracking system, so parcels are shipped, no updates at all regarding location at any time until delivery, and then when they arrive the tracker is changed to ‚Äòdelivered‚Äô. Even if I don‚Äôt need an item quickly, I will choose priority shipping to avoid having to use Canada Post. I hope they‚Äôre excited about becoming obsolete, because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre headed for. Why can intelcom tell me exactly where my package is and when it will be delivered, but Canada post can‚Äôt even use their own tracking system?"
"I sent a small box to Brazil in June with baby stuff in, such as baby diaper rash, baby bottle and clothes. My niece was born in September and my family never received my package that was suppose to arrive within two weeks.
When I checked my receipt, I realized that there was no tracking number, and when I questioned Canada Post, they said there is nothing to do about it, that my box was probably lost. They said I did not pay for tracking number. This is absurd! The person who did the service did something wrong and it was not my fault. Now, I am payment for somebody else mistakes and I lost money and time. My family was waiting for the baby supplies and they never get it.
I cannot believe that I paid for their service. Worst service ever!"
"I ordered from the OSC and after their delivery driver tried to deliver the package, he left the notice on my door as I was not home at the time. Their driver failed to attach the sticker at the bottom of my notice onto the package, and also failed to deliver my package to the pickup facility. After hours of phone calls with rude representatives and supervisors (I got one useful one out of 4) I was told that it‚Äôs MY job to contact the OSC and file a claim for the package they already had and lost. I assume a driver took it or it is literally lost because of the failure to attach my barcode sticker. Either way they have terrible customer service and should EXTREMELY consider reevaluating their policies in order to maintain a more responsible business. It should never be the customers fault, especially when THEY are the ones at fault and even agreed to that."
"They have the worst delivery drivers. At least 30 times they just put a notice in my mailbox WHEN I AM HOME and don't even attempt delivery a package less than a pound so it is not even heavy. I'm not kidding you, I had to chase them down four times to get my package because they were just dropping off a notice in my mailbox TO LAZY to get out of the car and one time when i ran out of my driveway to his car and said are you seriously putting a notice in my mailbox and he said oh, its slippery and there was ZERO ice on the ground so he just handed me my package and drove off. They need to fire all their delivery drivers and hire workers who are not the laziest people on the planet."
"I tracked the package even though it arrived in my city early,it took a day and a half for it to get to my home...horrible service..alot of people working for Canada post have an attitude also I found."
"Worst services ever

I sent a package in another country and it got lost in Hong Kong ! Which is the opposite of its destination.
It's been 3 weeks ans it's still in Hong Kong... waiting for... what???
I called and they just said I have to call back in a week if it's still there. I paid for an express delivery but I don't see the ""EXPRESS"" in this delivery. And, on the top of that, they don't want to reimburse the cost of the express delivery. Outrageous ! I'm not using Post Canada ever again !"
"In the past month I have had to ship very important documents overnight - Milton to Kingston. Each time I have paid for overnight shipping and each time it has not made it. I went to the main depot in Milton to ship.

Canada Post is not reliable, does not keep to service standards and should not be in business.

This time it was for a real estate deal. The broker would not take more than $5,000 on an e-transfer (something about fintrac which is ridiculous - your either in business or not and if filling out a fintrac form is an issue you shouldn't be in business) and wanted a bank draft which then had to be couriered."
"Outrageous! Even though it came a day early, they just left my package at my door step. Someone knocked and when I looked through the peephole, they were standing at the corner and I couldn't see them properly. I asked who it was, but I got no reply. Naturally, I didn't open the door, but kept asking who is was, but no one was replying. A while later the person left and I finally opened the door. And when I saw my package I wondered why they didn't answer. It happend multiple time, and sometimes they didn't even knock, just left."
"Horrible. Absolute disgusting service. Packages never come on time, fees I have to pay for the carriers mistakes, had to call customer service 4 times to receive my package. I guess Canada post isn‚Äôt paying its employees enough to do their jobs."
I would rate negative if I could. Caught the driver twice now trying to sneak a delivery attempt notice in the mail box. I guess carrying the package to the door is above his pay grade.
"Paid $25 to have a letter sent express to Alberta from Ontario. ETA was 3 business days. 5 business days later it is still in transit. Used the online chat to investigate and after 12 minutes on hold, I got a chat text and was promptly disconnected. Called the customer service line and got a computerized message that my package left on such and such a date and we have no further information to track it. Seriously. Heading into my post office to get my money back and find my package....."
"Customer service are almost impossible to get ahold of. I was waiting for my delivery today, I recieved an email saying that it had been delivered but it hasnt... nothing is in my mail box or infront of my door. Who knows were the package was delivered... and since they never answer and their online chat isnt an available option, I will probably never find out.

Why have a CS option when its unusable?"
"my parcel never arrived. they lost it. Their ""investigation ' is bogus. It only consists of them saying ""your ticket is now closed. We have taken all the steps necessary"". Then you have to call back again and again and ask to speak with a manager which . you never get , only a ""specialist' and then they tell you ""sorry your package is lost'. They claim ZERO RESPONSIBILITY for items that they are CLEARLY STEALING. BECAUSE IF SOMETHING NEVER SHOWS UP IT WAS STOLEN. If something is misplaced , workers will find it on the floor. But they steal because they can."
"I order lots of stuff from Amazon. When it's something large they use Canada Post. EACH time and i say EACH time it's never on time. EACH time and i say EACH time they never deliver the item, they leave a notice card. Don't waste your day waiting for a delivery from them, it will never come. Next thing you know you look at the tracking info and you will see : Attempted Delivery. It's not attempted, the driver just don't do it's job. He goes to the mailbox and put a notice in it, YOU go get your stuff at the post office.

Also 80% of the time they are not on time. I'm in Quebec and i order stuff from Amazon, it's coming from Missisauga, Ontario most of the time, it's supposed to take 2 days. It always end up taking 4-5 days. 5 DAYS to move package from Ontario to Quebec !!!!

Also don't you ever think you gonna have your package on the day it's says Out for delivery, often wait the whole day only to have it go back to the posting facility and being processed once again.

Also customer service is a joke. They are rude and can never do anything for you. How often i call them and it's always the same thing. ""All i have is the same tracking information as you"". YES. Don't call them to ask why your package is late, they don't have any information other than the tracking system you have. I could do their job from my home, why are we paying them for ?"
"If I could leave zero stars I would. I had two separate orders from the same store that were returned to the sender because my address ""could not be verified."" I live in an apartment but it's like they give up when it comes to people living in one. I had the BUILDING, ROOM NUMBER, and the freaking FLOOR on the address but they just returned it to the sender. I lost out on shipping costs and the stuff I bought. This is a sorry excuse for a crown corporation. AVOID AT ALL COST"
"One of most inefficient courier service ever. They‚Äôre always late in their deliveries. The amount of time waiting on the phone, just to speak to a customer service should give you an idea how many people are calling in to resolve an issue. This company is terrible. It‚Äôs sad the Canada is associated with this joke of a service."
"Absolutely terrible service. I paid for express shipping which is 3-5 days, after waiting 5 days for my purchase I phoned to gain clarification on this issue, after waiting a lengthy time the lady who answered extremely rude and unhelpful. She didn‚Äôt apologize at all, instead blamed others. I needed this package for a gift this weekend and now it will not be in until Tuesday. Extremely disappointed with Canada post."
Package got delivered in another province. I had 3 items on my order and 2 of them got shipped to the right adresse by another company and the only one sent by Canada Post was sent to Smithville Ontario instead of Montreal Quebec. How can this even happen.
"Canada Post is the most incompetent company imaginable. They have lost several items, sent things to other cities and provinces (and I had a heck of a time trying to recover a refund for them) and some things come damaged. They are so bad that I have just made a complaint with Amazon Prime because even though I have guaranteed delivery dates, my items are late by not one, but two days 90% of the time. I had to make a formal request to use ANYONE else but CP as a guaranteed delivery doesn't exist with them. Government monopoly, what do you expect."
"Do not use Canada Post to make a shipment of any sort. If anything happens to the package they will not take responsibility for it Their customer service is horrible, they will give you the run around in endless circles, refuse to try and help resolve and problem and then to make it worse will give you someone to talk to with a very bad attitude like Cheryl at 403-974-2203 Ext 2203."
"Canada post lost my package and have told me they will email me updates. No one cares, ive lost a few hundred for this package. Canada post wont cover it, because they telll me to go to the site i bought it from. But because it says shipped and delivered through canada post, the company has deemed irrisponsible for Canada Post losing the package. Long story short, im out a few hundred for no package and Canada Post is trash. I dont recommend Canada Post."
Terrible service. Multiple times when I‚Äôm at home the whole day with a bell that is not misseable (very loud long and clear sound) and they put a notice of delivery to pick up the package at the post office. This is at least the 3rd time. I called the custumer service at 4h30 when noticing what happened again and they tell me I will get news in 5 days about the issue. I tell them this doesn‚Äôt solve the problem that I don‚Äôt have my delivery the day intended and will need to make a detour at the post-office on the next day to pick up. They tell me the delay for redelivery will be at least 3 day which is unacceptable when it‚Äôs their mistake for not even trying to ring the bell to see if I was home or not.
"OMG! If I could give Canada Post zero stars I would. Since I cannot say C**k S***kers! I will call them member slurpers! What in the world is wrong with this organization? I ordered a cell phone from Surrey BC on Oct. 5th. My delivery should have arrived on the 11th give or take. When my cellphone didn't arrive by the 14th, I reached out to the seller, who in turn indicated he had mailed the item days before. Canada Post indicated they had some issues with my address and needed my home phone number for verification (something quite unusual). I verified details and asked for an estimate of arrival, Canada Post suggested roughly the 22nd of Oct. Around the 28th of Oct., I was quite PO'd with Canada Post. They insisted that an issue had been filed and that i would receive an update on my shipment before the end of the month and that my package will arrive by November 5th at the latest. Today I have tried to contact Canada Post through all of their channels (talk/ email / chat), unbelievably, all my attempts at communication were blocked or derailed or something. After waiting 35 minutes on hold over the phone, some guy with a French accent finally answered; he said (and I quote); ""Hello sir, I see you are calling about a delivery issue... I tried to answer but he interrupted... ""Sorry sir I cannot hear you, hello, hello?"" (he said very quickly) then added; ""Sorry sir, I cannot hear you, you will have to call back"". And he hung up! ???"
"I set up mail forwarding and the addresses were switched, even though I had to physically go to a post office to confirm my new address, which I did. If you are ever doing this, confirm your address with their attendant at least 5 times. I'd also avoid using the Canada Post office at Shoppers Drug Mart in Toronto, at King and Yonge. They will not refund me or switch the addresses. Awful service."
"The customer service department is basically useless, just do everything yourself to save your time and energy. The agents working there are just airheads and lack common sense."
"Canada post should not lie to customers. Mail man usually don't attempt to deliver mail/parcel but simply leave message saying ""attempted delivery"" even when someone is in the house. I have clearly noticed this several times. So what happens is I need to get the mail driving to the Shoppers post office which is nearly 5km away."
Folded our marriage certificate. Just great. I'm so impressed with how bad you actually are.
"Worst customer care experience ever! Rude, short and not helpful (Trishia Charmaine and Keith who i dealt with) . I will never use them as they are scam artists and are terrible customer service agents. Impossible to get your insurance claim back!! Package was supposed to be delivered Oct 22 and its no Nov 12. They sent one email after i called 2 times and sent them 5 emails asking for help with a LOST package. I was informed that it may be lost and that it takes a lot of paperwork, the receiver has to sign papers, and then maybe in a month they will declare it as a lost package. Then after all that they may issue an insurance claim!!!!"
I showed up to buy a stamp at the Bolton location on King Street at 5:40pm and the door was locked and the staff were inside almost finished mopping the floor. The sign on the door said they were suppose to be open until 5:45pm. The staff just ignored me. I am very disappointed because I rushed from work to make it there on time!
"I ordered an LG MICROWAVE OVEN online thru Walmart Cda on Wed Nov 6th. Walmart confirmed it would be delivered on Friday Nov 8th by Cda Post.
Well guess what!! Today is Monday Nov 11th and those stupid morons (Cda Post) still have not delivered it.
Their online tracker says it should be delivered on Tuesday Nov 13th because they are closed today as it is Mon Nov 11th and it is Remberance Day which they observe.
The bottom line is my package will arrive 4 days late (assuming these idi
clowns at Cda Post deliver it tomorrow (no guarantees on that either).
I chatted online with Cda Post today. They had their chat line open today SO WHY NOT HAVE DRIVERS ON OVERTIME TODAY DELIVERING PARCELS AS WELL??

I LITERALLY DETEST DOING BUSINESS
WITH CDA POST (WALMART USES THEM SO I HAVE MO CHOICE IN THE MATTER). THEY ARE THE MOST INCOMPETENT PEOPLE IN THE DELIVERY BUSINESS. IF THEY WERE A PRIVATE ENTITY THEY WOULD HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS AGES AGO BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE A CROWN CORPORATION THE FEDERAL GOVT KEEPS THEM AFLOAT.

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HAVE SCREWED UP REGARDING
DRLIVERING ITEMS FOR ME. IN SEPT THEY SENT AN ITEM TO BELLEVILLE, ONTARIO THAT WAS DESTINED FOR WINDSOR, ONTARIO AND NOW THIS CURRENT SCREWUP!!

DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND USE FEDEX, UPS OR SOME OTHER MORE RELIABLE CARRIER OTHER THAN CDA POST!! IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND AGGRAVATION.

I WOULD GIVE THEM A RATING OF -100 IF I COULD!!"
"sent my sister in Australia 500$ Last week.
She went to 4 different post offices to try and claim it. ( I already paid the amount from Canada).
Lady at Stratford post office said Any post office would clear that amount in Australia!! Not true!! Now my sister has to wait for clearance ?!! Wth!! Never ever again Canada post you‚Äôre a joke!!"
Why would Canada post leave my package at the door in an apartment building where 32 other doors shared the same hall way? This is like leaving my package on the street....Canada post need to fired the employees who don't care about the people....
This is the worse post service i have ever seen.
"What drives me crazy is how they'd rather leave a delivery notice at my front door than wait for me to answer it when they have a parcel I need to sign for. I'm not an old woman who takes 10 minutes to answer the door. I'm young, and am able to get to the door quickly. Yet, Canada Post delivery staff cannot be relied upon to do their job. Almost every time I'm expecting a delivery from Canada Post, I end up having to go pick it up from the parcel pick-up location because EVEN THOUGH I WAS HOME FOR THE DELIVERY, they left a parcel pick-up notice at my door rather than wait for me to come answer the door. Pathetic.

You'd think Canada Post delivery staff would want to provide good service so people will USE Canada Post and thus protect their jobs. But apparently not... And if this is the fault of Canada Post management placing unrealistic workloads on their staff, then shame on management. Either way, delivery service stinks and it's been this way for YEARS.

Because of this issue, when I'm ordering something online and have a choice of delivery method, I select UPS every time. At least UPS actually delivers my package to me, and their staff will actually wait for me to answer the door (unlike Canada Post staff). I'd rather give my business to Canada Post... but if they won't do their job, then I have no choice but to choose some other service."
"Canada post screwed my passport parcel and charged me extra..when I went to their office the customer service person showed a very bad behaviour and yelled at my friend only for asking that what should we do in order to get our parcel back from Ottawa office. Sooo frustrating, bad customer service in store as well as on call. They just take no responsibility of their work. And play games with the customer."
"I go to the same Canada Post Office every weekday and I am thrilled with the service, efficiency and kindness I receive. Julia is friendly, always ready to answer any questions and she goes out of her way to help everyone who comes in. It's wonderful to find people who care about the work they do and also about the people and businesses they serve."
"2019/11/07

I went to Canada Post with a prepaid label and content to be returned. I was greeted by ""Monalyn"" with an unfriendly tone and gesture. OK. I told her that I only needed to attach the label onto the bubble mailer, which she replies with, ""we don't carry mailing supply and you need to buy your own tape."" A postal office that doesn't have TAPE lying around? She had a pair of scissors to lend though. Not sure if this is a scam to increase her daily commission.

Whenever I go to Canada Post for postal service, I almost always have a negative experience. Just why?"
"One of the worst ever servicer. Even after 10 days, ( premium service), the package have not reached the destination. I guess personally i would have reached the destination more often than.

Service desk is again not that great and they do not know what they are upto. Altogether a pathetic service
I would rank this is lowest amongst all the companies in the category. Never ever venture here.
Not sure why i rated with 1 Star, ideally it should be rated in negative star"
"Several times I've had them come to delivery to my apartment, while I am home, and they didn't buzz me to come get my package. I include my buzzer number always, plus can be found on the apartment console. Instead, they just put the delivery attempt notice in my mail box and I have to wait until the next day to get it myself.

Bad enough. But then yesterday I was buzzed and I answered but was soon after hung-up on. I thought maybe someone let them in, and since they didn't ask me to come down that they would come up. Nope! After seeing no one for a while, I went down to check my mail box and found the delivery notice. COME ON!

Additionally, when I have calmly complained to Canada post while picking up said packages, I've only had patronizing apologizies in return. They know it's bad, and they don't care."
"They don't leave a notice on the door. If they did they would have seen the sign directing them to the secure location (lock box) where they could leave the package.
I paid to receive my item today, due to drivers neglect i will receive it tomorrow after i pick it up.
They refuse to refund shipping.
They wanted me to shut down my business and go to a convience store that does not have my package till tomorrow to see if they can do more for me???? REALLY"
"If zero stars were a possible rating I'd give them that, they don't even deserve a single star.

Why ship with a company that cannot meet their own service standards?

Everytime I end up having to have something ship via Canada post there is always an issue with delivery, whether its it being late, the post person being lazy and making no effort to deliver( someone is almost always home)

I'm only thankful this time around I didn't pay for shipping, theres ZERO excuse to inform a customer that their package is out for delivery, and then at 2:41pm have it rescheduled for no reason, and as of the writing of this review ZERO further updates.


Bottom line if you cannot meet your own service standards you have shouldn't be delivering packages, Canada Post isn't worth the price of a stamp anymore."
If I could give lower than 1 star I would. We captured on video a carrier attend on October 21st to drop off a new dyson vacuum at our residence. Nobody answered the door and instead of placing a ticket on the door that we could pick it up at a local depot he hid it in our bushes. The following day he returned and was observed retrieving it from the bush and placing it in his vehicle. He was confronted by our daughter and made excuses for what his actions were. He provided the package from his vehicle that was left out during the night in the rain in the bush. We put in a complaint was given a file number and promised a call from a supervisor that never happened. Unbelievable any other service would have gone out of business.
"Pay an arm and a leg in taxes, ontop of postage fees, to keep this s h i t service alive. For what? Do they even do their job? When someone orders Registered mail, they expect a signature and a name. Can't even get that right!! Then when you asl for a refun, thry issue something different than your receipt and try to convince you the receipt in front of you is wrong. Lets just get rid of Canada Post once and for all. Save our tax money."
"Canada post is again very unprofessional and irresponsible, unhelpful customer service, doesn‚Äôt take pride in what they do.
My package was delivered to the wrong house, someone stole things out of my package and dumped it on the street. No one from Canada post gets back to my inquiry. This would not have happened if they did not deliver my package to the wrong house! My address on the label was correct. Because of their mistake, my package is stolen, opened and dumped on the street. Canada post is irresponsible and untrustworthy with their customer‚Äôs parcels and packages."
"I ordered a package from China. I enter in the right address and postal code. 1 and a half weeks later i get a confirmation email that my package has been received by Canada Post and is en route for delivery. On the day it was supposed to come, it didnt come. I check back on my tracker and it said that ""Address was incomplete. I call the help line and i tell the guy what happened. I gave him my tracking number and he said ""Whats your current address?"" I tell him exact address i put on the package. He replies with ""Huh, thats weird, the location can be found i dont know why it did that, it must be a printing error"". He told me its going back to the sender and i have to talk to the sender and ask him to re send it. Thumbs down from Canada Post, I gave them my number on the package, they should've called me saying that my address was incomplete instead of saying ""Welp, it, lets send it back"". Now i have to wait another who knows when for me to get my package, or will it even ever get to my door. Frick U CANADA POST YOU GUYS ARE UNORGANIZED."
"My elderly friend paid extra for Express Post, which accompanied express processing to get a birth certificate. We were told the estimated time would be 2 to 3 working days.

The express processing was done. However, it has been a full week since the certificate was mailed from Quebec to Manitoba, and it hasn't arrived yet. This is delaying application for a Health card for a person with COPD. Canada Post needs to cancel Express Post. They should have an automatic refund (just attach $10 payment to the letter) when a letter takes more than 3 business days for delivery.

I actually think that asking for Express Post slows down delivery. There is likely an extra step in this processing, because snail mail is actually VERY fast. I almost never wait this long for a letter sent by regular mail."
"Ordered a package.
The driver lied and said he attempted to deliver.
I work from home, my desk is next to my front door.
Had to go to their depot and pick it up myself.
Paid 1st class - 2 days late.
Shocking. Harder to get it that wrong than it is right.
Sadly, not the first time."
They lost my mail and refuse to solve the problem.
"So, I paid $30 ($20 MORE than snail mail) with Priority Post for time sensitive documents to get from Alberta to BC... and FOUR days later I can finally track the parcel to see it just left Richmond Customs???? ... why is a parcel going through Customs from AB to BC??? I love it when Canada Post goes on strike for higher wages to be even more incompetent."
"Went to mail a small package to Germany. In the waiting line there was a sign stating all out of country parcels required an online form to be completed. Downloaded form to my phone. The form was not clear on how to complete it properly. After all the effort the final review page was clearly incorrect but could not correct it without re-entering all of the information. Sales clerk finally says, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need that, we can do it manually‚Äù??? At first I was relieved and then she hands me the form to fill out- I did not set aside 40 min of my day to stand at a counter to mail a package! They act like they can‚Äôt fathom what it would be like to have other things to do, and move at a pace that supports where this lack of knowledge comes from, all the while you are the one doing all the work- no service and clearly moving towards online self serve- employees need to wake up and make themselves relevant/ useful. So unbelievably mind boggling. I hate the ‚Äúsmall-business destroying‚Äù online shopping model but I a will never mail another package through Canada Post."
"Sold an item through eBay and responsibly paid for insurance.Buyer said the item arrived broken.Despite sending Canada Post all the documentation through both eBay and Paypal, as well as keeping the original parcel receipt, and obtaining the broken item at our own expense, Canada Post will not reimburse our insurance we paid. They said they ""require the email and personal phone number of the buyer"".Ebay and Paypal have a privacy policy that does not allow either a buyer or seller to obtain anything other than the address of the buyer/seller. For this reason, we were told never to buy insurance when sending something to someone you do not know well enough to obtain either a personal phone number or an email from ! We were told this by Canada Post."
Worst organization in Canada. I complained a worker of theirs refused to deliver a package to my door and instead of admitting fault they sent me an email saying the reason they didn't deliver was because I was hostile and argumentative and all these horrible titles they just slandered me with for no reason. Just because they didn't want to take the blame. So what the Canada post does is just slander the customer. I am a very nice person that never swears or does anything like that. It was a real shocker seeing that. Very upsetting.
"New Complaint about Canada Post,

I purchased Mail Forwarding service from Canada Post for 1 full year on Sept 15, 2019 to Sept 14, 2020 and the service has been working fine. I have been using Mail Forwarding services for a few years years in the past and I used to be able to change the delivery address in the past during the middle of the service year via online. Now Canada Post has upgraded their websites and now this option of changing the delivery address in no longer there, so I called customer service to notify them to change the delivery address to a new address. They advised me that they no longer allow this and if I want to change the Mail Forwarding service to a new address, I would have to cancel the existing service and purchase a new Mail Forwarding Service contract. They would not reimburse me for the 9 months still remaining on the paid service!!!! So essentially Canada Post is now stealing money from people for services that they do not complete. I advised them of essentially stealing from customers and the customer service agent just said ""This is the new policy and we can't help you"" . So I asked to speak with a manager and they put me on hold for 20 min and then the phone just hung up. I called back to Customer service to speak to a different agent and this time he understood my problem but still did not do anything about it, I again asked to speak to a manager, on hold again for 15 min and they hung up. Is this how Canada Post customer service is working now, just hanging up on customers without resolving the issue.
If they were to reimburse me for the difference of the pre-paid service I paid for then I would be ok, but instead they said that we could not longer make changes during the term and that I would have to cancel the service and not get reimbursed, I call this stealing. I can't believe they are getting away with this. I am going to post this complaint everywhere I can so that people are aware of the tactics Canada Post is going to, to steal your money!!!!"
"Very bad delivery service
I live in Maple.
All time my packages and mail recieving for another persons, becouse responsibility from Canada Post person put him to wrong mailbox"
"Very rude, unreasonable staff and bad customer service at Meadowvale town centre drugmart post office.Do'nt deserve even one star.dollar store has better customer service."
Horrible service and hopefully will stick to junk mail and flyer delivery. Every parcel they delivered to our home has been late or not delivered. I've never had an issue with Amazon or FedEx but Canada Post can't seem to deliver anything on time or correctly.
"As a postal service in canada you guys should be ashamed your so fu*king shi*ty! Holy fu*k there has never been a company so lazy, they cant do their job if they tried. I can litterally travel to my friends a province over within a day, but these punks can't be bothered to take something from that location and deliver it to me in 1 day noo doing thier job would be too easy... Try waiting 17 days or so. That should do the trick... Fu*kin terrible. Smh. Canada post should be shut down and replaced with a better service because they are actual trash. I wish i could get paid to do nothing 99% of the time on MY job like the people who work in canada post..."
"Every time I am supposed to get a package from Canada Post it is NEVER delivered to me. They say my buzzer is not labeled. My buzzer is very clearly labeled. They only do half a job. Don't waste your time or money on this company. When Canada Post goes under they have no one to blame but the delivery guys for not doing their job ever. Nothing but ignorant people. I will not order things online when they come with Canada Post anymore. I will pay extra for UPS. At least they know how to buzz me when they are here. I have been home all morning, the guy didn't even attempt to contact me. I bet any money he didn't even have my package with him, just a slip. Thanks for being late(as always). You screwed me on the present that was supposed to be here this morning. USELESS!!!! Could have done a better job myself."
"Express Post can be weeks late and no one knows what the issue is... they'll get back to me in maybe a week.. who knows, they tell me they don't know for sure and probably no one does. Alrighty then."
"Its to bad you can't go lower then 1 star. Canada post is an absolute joke!!!!!!!!

Ive called 7 differetn time today and I have been told 7 DIFFERENT storie of where my pagage is. How is it that no one who works for Canada post knows what the Hell they are doing. I will ever be using them again if this is the game they play.

So upset its not even funny."
"#1 - Went to the post office Thursday afternoon and paid $40 to ship items overnight to NYC for a once in a lifetime opportunity that was time sensitive. They required the items Tuesday morning. They said no problem it would be there Friday. Well it didn't even leave that post office until Monday night and didn't arrive until 2 days later - after the deadline. I lost a life changing opportunity because of careless CP.

#2 - 3 cheques sent regular mail anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours away from our office have vanished in the last 6 months, not a trace.

#3 - CP came to the office on our lunch break, no second attempt but I have to now wait all weekend and try again on Monday. Had to call and spend 30 minutes setting up a report to request access to pick it up from the post office as they won't try a second time outside of lunch time... Had to have a formal letter on letterhead drafted to prove I can pick up my own personal parcel.

#4 - Bought a new house and they won't leave packages despite it being away from any possibility of theft.. Go in with several legal documents to prove who I am, they absolutely refused. The CP agent said the only legal form they would accept is my drivers license which I had no intention on updating until required. So I had to take time off work to go have a new license issued with the new address all in time to get the package before it expired."
"Horrible experience, my package got returned to sender and they wouldn't give me a clear reason why. They said the address wasn't correct but I saw the address on the parcel delivery tracking and it was correct it was missing my unit #. I didn't get a notification, I didn't get a note on the door of my condo building ( WHICH EVERY OTHER COMPANY DOES) it wasn't taken to a pick up depot. I contacted costumer service and they didn't offer a clear reason why it was returned. Then they said there's no proof its my package. Even thought it has my full name and address on it. Then they said it was unreadable. They said there's nothing they can do and to just contact the sender to get them to resend it. Then they left the costumer service chat. I am so angry and disappointed with the whole experience."
"Very bad! The company lost my parcel one month ago and no response back after the phone call. No way to get a refund after all. From then on, I try to send everything to the Canada Post office near me, the first couple of times were fine. This time, the parcel worth $60, and they told me that I cannot send my parcel to the CP office (The lady at the CP office was polite though), so they return it to the sender and ask me to wait for the sender to send it back! The stuff in it is gonna expire! The customer service on the phone keeps saying ""I told you... I told you..."". Well, if you told me or the sender when we are writing done the Canada post office address that sending parcel to the office is against the company's policy, or if you told me ahead that you are unable to deliver my parcel successfully, I could have saved my $80 stuff in the parcel + $16 delivery fee! Don't tell me that I should read your pages of policies, I am not your employees. This kind of service is inefficient and not trustworthy! I got no way to give my feedback to the company because the company would not like to listen anyway. With Canada post's arrogance to customers, there is no way to shop online in my city, and I was so naive to think that I can."
"I've had problems with 4 packages in the last month. Three of them have been the courier deciding they weren't going to bother attempting to deliver my package. I literally watched the courier put the notification in my mailbox, because I had gotten a notification that the notice had been left BEFORE the mail had been delivered, because that would mean walking across the street to do their job."
"On October 8th, my friend has mailed two important documents from Montreal to Toronto using Canada Post Express. The package was supposed to be delivered by October 10th! I have not yet received it, and they are not responsive at all. I contacted them, and they even closed my service ticket on October 22nd, mentioning that I can ask the sender to contact them. My friend had already been in touch without any encouraging feedback. They have just told her to wait. The documents are government-issued letters, and we would go through lots of trouble if we won't receive them by the end of this month. This is frustrating :("
"Once again I've trusted Canada Express post and they let me down. I waited all day yesterday as said my parcel would arrive by end of day even the email alert said parcel was on truck. No parcel or notice. Than again today I waited only to have the driver not buzz my apartment but just leave notice in mailbox so I complained online and had the customer service rep say I'd be able to pick it up today at post office b4 9pm. We I just went there and of course parcel isnt there they said it wont be until after 1pm tomorrow. I will not be using their services again as I paid for 2 day Express last Thursday and I'm not getting until Wednesday afternoon.
What's the point of driving parcels around in truck if your not going to attempt to drop off parcels? They might as well drop them off directly at post office outlets and email u when it arrives! It's a shame your drivers are so lazy."
"Paid for hold mail. Last December .

All the held mail was then delivered to a wrong address. We complained but they never refunded us the fee.

Automated reply and nothing else.

They do not care at all."
Good only for regular mail delivery. Worst service for Parcel delivery. Rest all delivery services will deliver to Door (Not Canada Post). All other delivery services has option for delivery till Late in the evening + Saturday. Delivery can be scheduled by calling and thru online. Canada Post delivery is only on weekdays & that to 9 to 5.üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
"TERRIBLE TRACKING FOR PACKAGES NOT AS YET DELIVERED.

My parcel on the Canada Post website specifies a small almost innocuous package weighing less that 19 ounces. Also, on the same website Canada Post announces to the world that my little package would be delivered on October 16th 2019 at the end of business day. A bold statement indeed but Canada Post - that mighty Canadian Institution I dare say - is up to the challenge.

Unfortunately, my dear readers, it is now 5 days later - October 21 2019 to be precise. No package as yet has arrived from that beloved institution we hear so much about - the strikes, the delay tactics, the incompetence of management, staff and workers, etc. Shall I go on?

Yet, as a Canadian in good standing, I trudged through the expected Canada Post bureaucracy and - somewhat to my surprise - I discovered a Canada Post chat session - online mind you. An encouraging sign I thought.

After waiting more than 25 minutes, I finally got to ""chat"" - you know, like a friend- with someone at Canada Post.

I explained my situation and BINGO, a service ticket was issued with promises of bliss and resolution to my ""little dilemma"" within 4 business hours. As stated in the ""chat"", I would receive a ""call back"" within 4 business hours (based on our current Earth Calendar) by someone in charge or possibly a ""fixer"" of some sort. I was delighted. Canada Post has finally grown up well and strong and can be counted on as one of the big boys.

Alas, Dear friends, I did not receive any such ""call back"".

There must have been a very very rare computer ""glitch"" I thought to myself. Maybe a virus ate up my message.

Well, never mind. Back to the ""chat"" we go. Once again, a new service ticket was issued and the same promises made.

What could possibly go wrong, I thought to myself. After all it is a policy of Canada Post to call back within 4 business hours.

Well, things did not go according to plan I gather. No call back.

And the rest is history which I will summarize as follows:

Feeling treated like a fool, I mustered up my courage and dialed Canada Post support number - on October 21, 2019 - and after waiting that compulsory 26 minutes in queue, I finally got to speak with a Senior Resolution Specialist. Okay, I thought to myself, this is it. Finally I can have my problem resolved,

But, all my hopes were dashed. Another grand waste of time.

She had NO IDEA why Canada Post did not call back on 2 occasions within the requisite 4 business hours, she had NO IDEA where my package was beyond the information provided by Canada Post Online tracking, and finally had NO IDEA what Canada Post could do for me.

Mind you, she is a ""Senior Resolution Specialist"". Maybe I should have asked for a ""SEASONED Senior Resolution Specialist"".

Yes, call me naive: I thought this would be a breeze for someone with a title like that. I thought it simple enough: I am located in Montreal, the item last scan of the parcel was in Montreal on the 16 October 2019. The due date of delivery on the Canada Post website is the 16th of October 2019.

It is now October 21 2019. 5 days late - mind you in Earth days.

I said to myself: such a small problem for a ""Senior Resolution Specialist"" like her. Peanuts. She should tell me - without even breaking a sweat - where my parcel is located and when I should receive it.

Yet, my complete astonishment, no one in Canada post - even the ""Senior Resolution Specialist"" could tell me WHERE THE PARCEL IS - never mind WHEN I WILL RECEIVE IT.

To wrap this up: I have spent well over 3 hours with Canada Post online chats, dialing Canada Post's support number, commiserating with Canada Post staff, supervisors, ""Senior Resolution Specialists"" etc.. and I am no further along in receiving my parcel."
"IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOICE IN THE DELIVERY COMPANY YOU ARE GOING TO USE, DO NOT USE CANADA POST. They will steal your packages, then it will go under investigation for weeks, and you will be waiting a very long time. They do not accommodate for the horrible service, and they are by far the worst delivery company I have ever used. Please, I do not want anyone else to go through what I went through. Just do NOT use Canada post. (Unless you want your $1500 order to be stolen)üëçüèºüëçüèº"
"This is my third time of sending a parcel from the UK to Alberta. First time was bad but I thought it was because it was a standard service, second time took forever (during which the parcel was not trackable online or by Royal Mail or Canada Post for days, even though it was a Track and Signed service) but eventually was delivered to a depot after numerous calls to both Royal Mail and Canada Post, and this time around my parcels are completely nowhere to be found after 16 working days, whereas delivery was meant to take ""5-7 working days"". This is so annoying. I wish I had read reviews the 2nd time and I would have never used Royal Mail/Canada Post again. For both 2nd and 3rd times, tracking ended once parcel left the UK/was handed over to Canada Post. Rubbish service!"
"It‚Äôs been 3 months,,, I had send parcel to India and it‚Äôs not arrived yet ,this is the worst experience I had... and I do not recommend to anyone to choose Canada post."
"My Xpresspost Guaranteed Next Day Delivery did not arrive next day. The package includes my passport and I've now had to rebook my flight ($550 out of pocket). I've been on hold cumulatively for hours and hours and also been told on 4 occasions that someone will call me back however no one has called me during this process. Now, after calling them again and waiting on hold another 1/2 hour for an operator who basically has no more information than shows on the tracking page on-line I'm told that it could take up to a week to get my package/passport.

Definitely using Fed Ex in future for anything important and time sensitive. Don't trust this Canada Post Xpresspost Service."
"I am often the first person to post a bad review, so thought it appropriate to post a good one after the amazingly good service provided to me by Canada Post. My daughter returned home to Toronto by air and left her house and car keys behind In Saskatchewan. I found the keys while she was still in the air and took them to my local post office. The CP representative suggested the best and most cost efficient to get the keys to her ASAP. It cost me $21 and the keys arrived to my daughter THE NEXT DAY! I am flabbergasted. Even Purolater can't do that! Well done Canada Post!"
"Canada post sucks , they dont even re send your package when there horrible drivers dont make delivery attempts. Some women was to lazy to bring my package an I called an they absolutely did nothing about it an wouldent re deliever it . Pathetic company , I recommend ups or even fed ex ."
1 star only because I have to pick one 5 days now Victoria BC to Edmonton and still nothing says it left Richmond 2 days ago this is the worst service never use again
"Horrible horrible service, delivery wasn‚Äôt attempted and when I went to pick it up the package wasn‚Äôt there. I walked 15 minutes to get there and stood in line for 30 minutes only to be told my package wasn‚Äôt back yet. It was supposed to be available for pick up at 6pm and I got there at 7pm. Gross incompetence."
"Terrible and incompetent. I wish a zero star rating was possible - it's still giving them far too much credit though. If you want a package lost in transit these are your guys!

You want gross incompetence?
You want to pay for a fast delivery service but never get your product?
You want a complete lack of accountability?
Then folks, I suggest you use these clowns."
"Same story every day I expect a package. I'm home ready to receive the package. Package doesn't come. I go to mailbox in the afternoon and find the ""Attempted Delivery"" notice. Except Canada Post didn't attempt to deliver anything and they never do. Just another case of lazy overpaid government employees."
Worst company ever . Never using their services again. They lost my package and now I‚Äôve been dealing with trying to get a refund for 4+ months. Insane.
slow af and extremely expensive
"I ordered a package from the US instead of locally in Canada because in the past that company has shipped with UPS/FedEx and I receive the items faster than I would locally. Specifically chose that company because I thought they DON'T use Canada Post and I needed the package for an appointment this week. USPS took 36 hours to get it from Kentucky to Ontario, and somehow Canada Post is taking six days to get it from Mississauga to Oshawa. As someone who works a slow paced government job I am blown away by the inability of Canada Post as a service."
"So, it was received then went missing. Apparently without insurance on your package they have the right to just steal your belongings and not give you anything in return. After an investigation they informed me what i already knew, that they had scanned my package once and then it seems to have went missing...."
"An official from Canada Post informed me today that their letter carriers are NO LONGER required to deliver a PACKAGE to any HIGH RISE APARTMENT, CONDO OR OFFICE SUITE!
They can leave a ""cannot deliver notice "" instead... without ever having tried to contact the recipient!
Clearly, they will never, ever, go out of their way to deliver to an apartment/condo/suite if now they NEVER have to!
Why would anyone ever order from AMAZON again if it means having to drive to a post office and wait in line for an hour!
Tell AMAZON to NEVER use Canada Post!"
"Worst service ever. Paid for expedited shipping, been a week already and post office says at least another week to travel 60 km. When I called to discuss with Post Office, they acted like this was normal and I should just be patient."
"Sent a valuable item by Xpresspost, guaranteed 2 day delivery. Has taken 5 days to go 75 km, still 1500km to go. Last processed 3 days ago. Raised a case and the response was platitudes about always progressing, give it 3 weeks and we will email you with next steps. Probably be claim off the insurance which I had to pay for. Despite platitudes to the effect Canada Post take no responsibility. Looking at reporting it stolen by Canada Post."
"Have limited days to send information to be able to collect my pension. Paid $16 for next day delivery. Checked tracking wrong city wrong address.
So now I lose everything I be worked all my life for.
I put my trust in your service and now I see how competent you are.
Fix it.
Find it. Finally send it..TODAY."
"the worst postal service in the world. for registered parcel, they come to the building but dont deliver the item and i was in my apartment waiting for the postman. but the postman doesnt even knock the door but leaves a card where they say that i should pick up my parcel the next day from a post office 2 km away................ridiculous. honestly the worst service in the world."
"7 days to send a shipment and it is still im Montreal, Seriously?
If I‚Äôm sending this one on a Horse or bike won‚Äôt take that time. And it is express mail with a tracking number.
Last time will use this service"
Poor service and always they don't deliver the mail on time. I will not recommend Canada post to someone. Even they don‚Äôt deserve one star.
"Paid $150 for express delivery from Toronto to Edmonton
Package came late due to a postal worker refused to deliver a damaged package. The reason - ""Our policy prohibits us from delivering a damaged parcels because customers can get angry""

Had to pickup myself from a local CP centre a very heavy parcel.
Parcel was badly damaged what looks like a fork from a forklift.
Had fresh vegetables in it. Many of them had to be scrapped.

Called the route's supervisor Jackie. Not only she didn't apologized, she also tried to make me guilty for sending fresh vegetables.
Contacted Customer service with 2 tickets. One for late delivery, one for damaged goods.
Waiting 3rd week now for response."
"i had my package worth ~ $150 shipped from Toronto to Calgary on August 28 with standard delivery.
Been waiting for 2 weeks, keep tracking the package and no response
I decided to call Canada Post to ask for my shipment. They said that it was in transit. WHAT?? 2 weeks?
Now it's been 32 days. Finally, get notification from CP, it says that the shipment is lost. Just send an email to say sorry and NO REFUND AT ALL!
WORST"
Extremely poor tracking service I‚Äôm sure to express my dissatisfaction with Amazon that used Canada post to ship my package
If it‚Äôs possible I can give them -5. As they cheat us. And worst customer service
Always unreliable. Even with amazon prime you wont receive it unless its delivered by Purolator. canada post likes to lose items or make you go pick up in person before even trying to go bring it at your destination
"Horrible Experience
Spent an hour on the phone/on line. Had to create an account to forward mail..all kinds of personal info. Put my cc in, which again is all my personal info. It said i could not be verified, eben though its name, address, phone, cc number with my name.
Long story short said it failed to verify 3 times, i have to go down to the Post Office in person ??
Umm...No.
In the age of technology...i can't forward mail because they can;t ""verify"" me. Its changed everywhere, looks like I keep my $100 !!
No wonder snail mail is dying...."
Avoid Canada Post if possible. I loss 3 packages in August and because I received a email saying delivered they told me in was scan into my mail box and say I received it. They just gives me a run around no answer too there poor customer service so I was out $300. Yesterday day I received a package for the house number 25 and I live in 15 guess he received that package too but it was scan into his box time to resolve this and get it right Canada post.
Nothing but horrible experiences and delayed packages with no reason. I don‚Äôt want to use any company that uses Canada post as a shipping company. Takes 2 weeks to ship something from BC to ONT when I can get a package from Europe that has to go over customs faster. Takes days to get packages from Toronto to KW. Horrible customer service.
"I actually had a really terrible experience with Canada Post two days ago with a package not finding its way to me. However, a couple of employees at the Amherstburg branch went above and beyond to get my package to me. 1/4 of the shipping label wasn‚Äôt printed (shippers error), but they hunted me down with just my last name and drove it out to me immediately. Granted an agent I chatted with yesterday was of absolutely no help, locally I‚Äôm very grateful for how awesome they treated me!"
""" attempt to delivery"" my a**. The delivery staff just drop my package off at pick up point EVERY TIME without ringing doorbell. And to make things worst is that they have to drop it to a pick up point that's 10mins away when there is a much closer one. To get the package home I will have to drive 20 mins and 10mins wait. The reason people shop online is because they don't have time or they don't want to go through troubles like moving a shelf into a car. 30mins of time I could've go to a store to get it myself without suffering from their sh**ty service. I contacted them and they said Canada post only deliver package to community mailbox unless it require signature and that they are not obligate to follow Amazon's policy for delivering. Ya so how could a box of diaper or a big shelf be fit into a community mail box? Stop making excuse and do your job to deliver instead of faking me saying ""attempting to deliver"" but never even try. Apparently , Canada post has over 90% of shares in Purolator. I would pay extra to avoid these company and I will never buy from a seller that ship with Canada post.

1000+ reviews with 1 star yet you still don't improve your service in any way. I guess you don't give a s*** eh"
"Item shows online as delivered but it never arrived. Apparently, it was delivered to the wrong person as the address and name are corrected. Now I am stuck between the seller and this crappy service."
"Order parts from a store that is 45 minutes away, paid $60 for shipping because I need it asap, got the tracking number in the morning that they have had recieved it and still they have not ship it to me. I've order parts from Amazon $40 for shipping and it came from the states in two days!"
"I am not sure what is going on, but either my packages arrive damaged or don‚Äôt arrive at all. I was getting better service when the were on strike...."
"I was expecting a check to arrive in 5 business days and It didn't, all because it takes 5 to 7 business days."
"My regular delivery man is AMAZING. My problem is with the guy that covers him when he is off. Lazy, lazy, lazy. At like 8am it will say, ""out for delivery"". 10 minutes later....""on way to pickup location"". This guy almost never delivers, he just dumps the packages at the pickup location. Multiple complaints have been filed. I have been told by a service rep that I need to be careful with complaints because the drivers are known to retaliate...like not deliver packages at all, they magically get lost, leave packages in unsafe locations or even damage the packages. Seriously!?!?!. So Canada Post knows these issues exist and do NOTHING about it. I wish there was an option to allow online shoppers the ability to choose their own method of delivery; I would pay more just to avoid Canada Post."
"The most incompetent customer service. I called THREE times in order to speak to someone who was even remotely able to communicate. And they will not allow you to speak to a supervisor upfront which is absolute b.s. So, you're almost forced to speak to someone who is completely inept. Embarrassed this is a Canadian company."
"Most shi**y service ever. I paid express shipping for a parcel I had to send. Thinking I‚Äôd be delivered the next day but, dumb a** Canada post decided to hold it in for and extra 2 days. What the hell was the use of paying for express. ‚ÄúWe are sorry but we can‚Äôt do anything about that‚Äù, my a** you can‚Äôt do anything."
"NEVER SEND AN IMPORTANT LETTER WITH THEM!!! About two month ago I bought an priority envelope because I needed something to be shipped to Toronto on a Friday! The person on the counter made a mistake and entered the wrong post code into the system and on Friday I got my mail delivered to myself! We went to the post office and we had to pay an other priority mail to get it shipped for Monday!! For there big mistake and our delay we just could listen to a lot of apologize which I think is not enough! Because of that mistake my visa application is delayed!! The second priority mail we sent they made an mistake with sorting so it arrived finally on tuesday! How stupid can you be to make a mistake at the same priority letter 2 times in a row!!
If you have some important mail to ship, never ship it with them!!"
"I ordered a package on Monday, it's been over a week and still has not been shipped yet.
Customer service does nothing and dosen't care about damaged or lost packages.
They are lazy terrible workers and are the worst shipping company in Canada."
"Works from Monday to Friday, can‚Äôt respect their own delivery delays.

An Xpresspost parcel sent from Ontario to Quebec the 19 September can‚Äôt be delivered before Monday 23 September.

This is damn slow for an express service.

What a poor quality of service.

Deserves a 0 star. Period."
Very bad ... I didnt like.
"Absolutely terrible service. What a disgrace. Of the five packages I have ordered recently, and paid express shipping for, 1 arrived at my house, 0 arrived on time!
Instead I get notice cards in my mailbox for some strange reason, telling me how I wasn't reachable, when I've been sitting at home WAITING all day for this package to arrive. I order things for home delivery since I don't drive, so Canada Post sending my packages to a shoppers drug Mart half an hour away is f****** useless. (And they won't resend the package out to you once it's at the store). Shame on you Canada Post!!! Just do your f****** job. Is that asking too much?!"
"I don't know where to start...Buts lets say 1st, from my experience delivery in Longueuil, is away better than Ottawa...Why?

In 2 weeks, I had 2 packages delivered to my address through Canada Post and for both of them a notice card left.

I'm at home 24h, and for both deliveries, no one tried to call the buzzer or knock on the door; even though the elevator is 3sec from the mailboxes (1.5minute from my apartment). So, now I have to spend $ money or walk 40minute to where to pick up the package.

Other delivery companies do their job properly, like Intercom and Purolator (At least I have fewer issues with them than Canada Post)."
"Can I give it -5 stars?

Absolute crap. My package has been ""out for delivery"" for FIVE days now. Called customer service and they offer zero help. Telling me that the package is tracked to be in Mississauga. I live in Mississauga! You're gonna sit there and tell me it's taking 5 days to mail within the same city?"
"Canada Post is dependable and reliable, better than most carriers"
If I could give a 0 star I would . I mailed out a package to a family member and paid Express it sat at the town I live in for almost 2 weeks. And I called they said they would investigate it and keep me updated never heard from them . I check the tracking it then said it was at the half way mark for about a week I call back again to find out its unshippable and the lady said they would send it back to me . So half a week goes by I call again only to be told they throw it out I said well I need them to pay for item and the shipping cost they said they cant do that so now I have to pay my family back all that money back . Because there employees damaged it making it unshippable they lost my business and I ship alot . FedEx and ups have now gained my business .
"Their Customer Care service is useless. They WILL NOT do anything for a lost, undelivered or damaged parcel. THEY WILL NOT compensate you. If your parcel is delayed, they will hold it hostage.
Canada Post Couriers are lazy as f***k with IQ level of that beneath of a ring worm.
Canada Post workers are lazy and greedy, especially those who work behind the desk, they keep going on strike to ask for more but their service is s**t.
If you want reliable postal service, just go with FedEx, Purolator, or UPS.
They have a way to contact their courier while on route. Canada Post is still operating at status quo. and has not changed or revolutionized their service."
"For almost 2 years now, out of every 5 parcels I ordered online ( ebay, Alibaba, etc) I only received about 3. Most parcels are usually from China with free shipping. I can track the parcel on china post aftership up to the Canadian borders but somehow they never get delivered to my address. Even though I get refund thru either ebay or paypal, I find this occurrence very upsetting. What happened to those parcels between the Canadian port of entry to our sorting plant in Mississauga? This is a mystery? Calling the customer service hotline is futile.I can no longer trust Canada post, now I will resort to paying a little extra to get signature delivery with international tracking."
I usually have good experiences with Canada Post. Not today. I have been home all day and did not get a knock at my door or a ring on my buzzer. They left two delivery notices in my mailbox instead. I made sure to stay home today so I could receive those packages.
Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I was waiting all day for my package and I was in the kitchen (front door attached). They never knocked or rang the bell. So now I have to call shoppers at 7pm and walk across town IF they have it. This isn't the first time this has happened.
"Horrible service, they said the delivery man stopped at my house which he didn't, now I have to go and spend extra gas to go to the next town, no compensation considering I spent extra money for Express delivery and they delivered it to the wrong town. Horrible incompetent people that work for them no wonder why they are going down hill."
"This is not the first time that they are supposed to deliver an specific day and then they let you waiting without notice all day waiting then day decide to just deliver the following day or 2 days later. They have standard excuses like ""Verifying recipient's address; Possible delay"" or ""Item re-routed due to processing error; Possible delay"".. etc.
Then they show up any day during the time people are at work and leave a notice, to pick up ""the following day after 1pm"" so.. Another day of delay... Frankly.. They should close this ""service""."
Six days to get from China to Edmonton one day in customs and now 7 days from BC to Edmonton and still not here. You could walk it here faster. Canada post is so slow and unreliable.
"I ordered an item on Amazon that ended up being shipped by Canada Post. The item was reported delivered on Amazon‚Äòs website and Canada Post tracking. The package was not delivered at the time stated, and I still do not have my package. I contacted customer support and they basically said there‚Äôs nothing they can do. They are an awful company to have to deal with. The customer service does not care about the fact that they lost a customers package."
"We live in a condo complex, we all have separate doors to each unit. All Amazon orders delivered by Amazon to our unit are delivered to our door, with never a problem. Amazon orders delivered by Canada Post end up with a pick up notice in our community mail box. There is never an attempt by the postal worker to deliver to our door. With Canada Post deliveries we have to make a trip to the postal station a 15 minute drive away.
Terrible service"
"I stayed home all day . I live in condo . When they delivered , They had never give me a call .i gave them all my information which as buzz number ."
"Canada Post needs a complete redo of it‚Äôs entire business model. I have never been able to rely on their service and have been left especially disappointed this time around.

I ordered through a retailer and Canada Post was supposed to deliver my item nearly a week ago. It is now one day past the latest expected delivery date, and their tracking system still says ‚Äúdue (yesterday) by end of day‚Äù. I have not even been given a reason as to why my shipment is so late or when I can expect a solution, which is such unbelievably poor customer service. I tried their live chat feature yesterday and never reached an agent despite being in line, so tried again just now. I was told that ‚Äútracking my order is my responsibility‚Äù how is that supposed to be helpful?Besides, I have been tracking my order every single day this week! They told me there was an issue verifying my address, and my shipment is being held and could likely be sent back to the retailer. This was aggravating, but I would have understand this delay had someone on their end mentioned it to me in any capacity. But no, nobody said anything and I was led to believe I‚Äôd have my shipment by late last night. In the end I told them to cancel my order as I could have just gotten it in store days ago had I known this would drag on like this. I only ordered it so that I could surprise someone by having it sent to them, and I didn‚Äôt want to get it in store yet because I was under the impression it was on it‚Äôs way.

Their live chat agents are slightly condescending in tone and make you feel like perhaps it‚Äôs something you did wrong, but now that I see 93% of reviews being one star here, I‚Äôm assured it‚Äôs not me and I‚Äôm furious. Canada Post needs to take accountability for their one star service and stop making their angry customers feel like it‚Äôs something we‚Äôve failed to do on our end.
If I can help it, I‚Äôll never order through this company again."
Absolutely trash service item has been out for delivery for a full 24h godamn sacks of human waste
"I came on trustpilot to air my complaint at the atrocious service I have had from Canada Post and was utterly amazed how widespread the discontent with this organization is. Never have I come across such a damning report on trustpilot and feel the Canadian Government should step in with an attempt to rectify this lamentable situation. This is an embarrassment to a nation which otherwise is held in high esteem throughout the world. The complaints here are so many and so diverse they illustrate radical transformation, starting at the top, is now urgently required. New management could pension off the jobsworths and those who can‚Äôt be bothered in this organization, transforming it into an efficient, obliging service for the consumers who depend on it.
My own complaint is that for the second time I have had parcels returned to Scotland from Canada for utterly petty reasons. The first, about six years ago, was because I had put the customs declaration label on the wrong side of the parcel! Last week I again had a parcel returned undelivered which bore precisely the address demanded by both ebay and PayPal. I can only assume this return was because I had placed Quebec on the line above rather than on the same line as the postcode (which incidentally is also prefixed QC for Quebec).
As a child I was fortunate enough to live for over a year in Canada in the early 1950s. Even then I remember my parents being horrified that the merest discrepancy with an address meant it was undelivered. This culture of petty pedantry has clearly persisted in Canada Post. With new direction from the top and a smattering of common sense from all concerned, it could join the ranks of the world‚Äôs excellent, efficient and obliging postal services."
"If I could give zero star or negative 100 stars, I would. By far the worst shipping service I've ever encountered. I sent a package from Hong Kong to a customer in Canada. There was no update after passing through customs. It's been almost two months of no update. I had to refund my buyer which costed me a lot of money. Customer support is terrible. Not helpful at all. They just asked me to file an inquiry with my original post office. I don't get it. The package is already in Canada? And my local post office would only ask me to file a claim instead of helping me to trace it. The package is now lost in transit! Thanks Canada post!"
Horrible service everytime I order these guys can't be bothered to come on time always late. Hire people who actually care about the job not some Id!ots who can't be bothered to do it right. Service is always sh!t
Already a week late (From their estimate) and counting. How is this company so incompetent.
"What is the one service that Canada Post is supposed to provide? Delivering items from A to B correctly, and with maximal speed (corresponding to the delivery rate paid for by the customer). They have ONE job.
I was required to send an official university document across the country for admission to a graduate program. The document was of utmost importance and the timeline was highly sensitive. I paid an exorbitant fee to have it delivered by express post, and carefully filled out the fancy envelope with extreme attention to detail. I was assured it would arrive by the date it was due. However, Canada Post royally messed up. They mishandled my parcel and delivered it to the clearly marked ""from"" address.
You can imagine my disappointment and anger at finding it returned to me. I then had to go through the stress and trouble of resending it, at an even greater expense. Because the day they mishandled the parcel back to me was a Friday, even the most expensive option meant a 5-day delivery time.
My application to the program was rejected because the document did not arrive in time. It was not my blunder, yet is has hugely impacted my career and life. I was not even offered a full refund.
I am outraged and astonished at the utter incompetence of Canada Post. I will do everything in my power never to use their services again."
"This is unfortunate that there is no zero star to rate. My experience of getting a package delivered from US is terrible:
1. They delivered not sure where and updated their tracking system status as Delivered.
2. Tried to lodge a complain and the Canada Post rep had difficulty accepting the fact that billing and shipping addresses could be different for a package
3. Anyway, after three calls a ticket was opened
4. When I called next day found out that my email address was entered incorrectly in the ticket
5. I was told that the sender is supposed to open a ticket after 24 hours for something I needed urgently
6. I called my supplier to find out that they are not bound to do it
7. Then I called Canada Post and the response I got is 'oh well, we have delivered it to the wrong depo' and go ahead and bang your head we are not going to fix this."
"I took the day off work specifically to receive a package as it was important it arrived as soon as possible. I waited by the front door, only to get a ticket update claiming that I was not home and a notice was left. There was no notice, of course, as they did not bother to even attempt to deliver.

I tried to file a support ticket first, stating that the deliveryman lied and just marked off 'not home, notice left' without actually leaving a notice or trying to deliver at all. The canned response I got back was that the system says I received a notice, completely ignoring what I just sent the ticket in for. Since they won't respond to me in private, I'm writing it here in public. Screw these negligent a holes, go with absolutely anyone else."
"If I could give these guys 0 stars I would. Several times I have had delivery of receipt saying delivey attempt and nobody home and notice left - even today. I work from a home office. My office faces the street and is right beside my front door. I can actually see when the truck pulls up and have been working all morning and not a knock or anything and no delivery notice left even though it sasys delivery attempt and notice left. I can say this delivery guy never even attempted and is a huge liar liar pants on fire.
This is exaactly why I opt for UPS / DHL etc. whenever possible.
Mount Albert Canada Post delivery person = no good."
"I work alone as a small business making Mickey Mouse Ears for people who are going to Disney or want them as a costume piece. Yesterday, I had to express ship two pairs to a mother a few towns away from where I was. I asked the worker if this was 100% guaranteed to arrive within the end of the next day and was promised absolutely yes. After asking multiple times I even said if there is the chance it will not, I will drive there myself, but was promised that no, it will absolutely arrive within the next day.

Today, I checked tracking and it says arriving the end of the day TOMORROW, a day late. The package is now useless because they leave for Disney at 4 am that day.

After a lengthy phone call with two support agents, I got no where. Not only was I not able to pickup the package to deliver it myself, but it was two towns away the OPPOSITE way from where it was supposed to go.

A very unfortunate exchange as now now only have I lost out on the payment I made to Canada Post, but have now lost the business exchange as well.

Would rank negative Stars if I could."
"At 3:30 pm, ExpressPost updated the tracking to say that at 3:54 pm the company was closed. Sitting in my office the entire time.

I believe they do this because they will be late so this is an easy out. Second time this has happened."
"Canada Post Massive Screw Up!!!

Package sent from US - I received notifications every single time the package was scanned - arrived to Richmond Hill today - then I got notification that it was delivered. Went to the community mail box - NO package - online notification states it was left with Concierge - Ummm I live in a single dwelling house - as the address states.

Called to inquire, they allege that the sender has to lodge the complaint and to start the investigation - SERIOSLY??? A Package that your staff screwed up on delivery, and all you can do is shrug and have me waste time to contact the sender? Great service... just great.

How are they so incompetent?"
"excited to receive a letter from my long distance partner who sent me a self care package and a long hand written letter only to find it DRENCHED and the ink seeped through the entire package making the pages unreadable, put me to tears to see so much effort go down the drain,,, literally. The lack of care and handling is disgraceful and honestly disappointing. Thank-you for ruining something so extremely special and meaningful"
"Unprofessional practices & procedures from government monopoly.
Will re-route parcel to Montreal flying direct from British Columbia to Moncton NB without explanation resulting in extremely late delivery?ü§î I seriously question this as nothing needs to go thru customs??
Canada post seems unable to handle direct flight deliveries August 2019."
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. This isn't the first time I had ordered a package, got my tracking number and took time off work to wait for the package as it was urgent I had it that day. They didn't buzz my apart or leave my a pick up slip. This is happened on multiple occasions and anytime I complain about it the agents are useless and ""apologetic""."
Sent an important package trusting express post to deliver within the advertised delivery time frame. It took twice as long as advertised. Will not use for express shipping again.
"I ordered a item from china and it took 15 days for them to receive it, i understood that it was going to take a while and that i should just be patient and wait. after the item was scanned at customs and was given to Canada post there was no movement. Throughout four days they told me to wait and then finally filed a service ticket. 5 days into the ticket i get no response on my item and on the 6th day i finally get a scan that its in Calgary going to Amazon. i then talk to a supervisor and she tells me a straight lie that the sender probably put the wrong address but the previous agent that transferred me to this lady told me that its odd that the shipping information that was sent from the start had my address on it, i even told her that the company sent a pic of the parcel before sending it out to confirm with me, after telling her the previous agent has already confirmed with me the information, she then say one second and hangs up on me and when i call back she canceled my service ticket without informing me. im now unable to send the ticket to the company as the ticket has been removed from Canada Post. i find it laughable that i had this company in high regards over UPS and Purolator, atleast with those two companies they can call the sorting factory and call you back in the same day to confirm your item is safe and onroute. Number one carrier in Canada my bum !"
"I SHARE MY EXPERIENCE BEFORE THIS ALSO THAT VERY BAD SERVICE FROM CANADA POST.
TWO MONTHS BEFORE I COULD NOT receive MY MASTER CARD STATEMENT, I BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST deliver SOMEWHERE AND I HAD EXPERIENCE. ALSO ONE MONTH BEFORE ONE MOBILE TOUGHEN GLASS ORDER FROM ONLINE, NOW THE SUPPLIER SAY THEY DELIVERED BUT I DID NOT GET MEANS THEY MUST deliver SOMEWHERE.
SUCH A CARELESS"
"I'd give them 0 stars if I could.....not sure if it's their system or their lazy employees but my package came today, I wasn't home (who is home during 9-5 hours of the week?) so INSTEAD of dropping the package off at the nearest Canada Post (literally right around the corner from my place in a Hasty Mart) they put the package BACK IN TRANSIT to be delivered tomorrow after 1:00. Because of this I have to now drive back home tomorrow JUST to pick it up. Honestly, we should boycott these lazy crooks who have 0 considerations and customer service skills. What a terrible system with no standards. The worst."
"I got double charged for their mail forwarding service. When I called to inquire why, I was placed on hold for the representative to talk to another department. When he came back on the line he informed me that I might see a credit 14 days after the mail forwarding service was going to start, and that I would not be provided the service, and have to go to the post office to buy the service. I think I will be waiting to see if I get credited first before buying the service again, although I may loose some mail. Such a same that we depend so much on Canada Post!"
"no attemp at delivery, 2 days late for drop off at local post office. overall terrible. any other company with this service would be out of business long ago"
Holy crap if you want the laziest company to deliver your package super late then look no further! lazy $%^&'s dont know how to knock or what a door bell is they just wait till your out of the living room and leave that stupid notice on the door. never ever ever going with you lazy a$$ ever again!!! if i order something online and you are the only shipper i will find a different website to order off of just to avoid your $h1tty service! if you can even call it service!
"Canada post worst mailing company of canada. Got insurance for my phone they break the phone i paid them $200 for shipping to India and then was never told about Customs that was around $750 . I got additional insurance for my phone around $2000 they just had that miney in there pocket and said sorry we can‚Äôt process because it was sent to different country , i mean i got insurance for this reason if something happens within that time it should take care for its repair .
I would say don‚Äôt do mail from canada post.
That are totally ‚Äú Screwed up‚Äù."
They don‚Äôt even deserve stars. I can‚Äôt say anything about the head office but I had a. Issue with a package and the women I talked to lied so much. First saying that I told her that I had the package and I never did and she tried to tell me that she had the message to prove it and I told her to play it she avoided it and to call another number. Then she tells me that she never said the address 205 that it was 105 but in the message she sent me the first time she said 205. And so did other employees when I filed a complete. Then she also said that I should go get my package. I said I would in the message I sent back to her but I didn‚Äôt because I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. Then she tells me that we talked before which is. A lie because I‚Äôve never talked to her before only in voice mail but I told her that she got all offended and started to argue with me saying we did talk when we never did. So I told her 1. If the address is wrong you have contacted me. 2. Once you figured out where it was you wanted me to go get it which is not my job to that. Well agriculture with so she just avoided everything I said to her. If I was arguing her points she got defensive but when I would bring up my points she would ignore everything I told her and I said to her nobody likes Canada post and she‚Äôs like I hard that tons of times like she didn‚Äôt give a dame. Well I have posted a complaint and I‚Äôll see if anything gets done!
"It is the worst service in the world similar to third country one,it took 4 days from Toronto to Montreal for a priority parcel, and the they made waste one day waiting for out for deliver notification which was never done. For your peace of mind avoid them and choose another carrier."
Lost my passport in mail.Such a horrible service.Employee Never listened to me she put me on hold and hung up after 45 minutes without saying anything. Such an Awful experience with the company.
"trash, They lost my package. Why is this company even in business. Their customer service is very unhelpful,and enjoy delegating the blame to the ""sender"" of the parcel"
Majority of the time I‚Äôm home and they don‚Äôt knock or anything they just leave a notice in the mail box. Multiple times they have messed up and I paid for 2 day shipping and would get emails saying there‚Äôs going to be delays because they sent my package somewhere else. And I end up getting it two weeks later. They are horrible
"I'm home but they say I wasn't. Repeatedly. Canada post delivery of packages has seriously deteriorated. We grew tired of finding notices that we weren't home when we were and having to go pick up packages. So we got ""Ring"", a service that has a camera in the doorbell that starts recording our front door, motion activated, when they went on sale on amazon. You get notified if there is motion at your front door and if someone rings your doorbell. It records them. So any claims that we aren't home are now b@#$(*it. We have those M(#*%F##*)@s ON TAPE. Sure enough, yesterday a bozo pulled up in his truck and stood at the back of the truck for about one minute, giving me time to get to the front door. i walked out and stood there and waited while he fiddled around, then when he went to close the doors, he sees me and says, ""OH, you ARE home."" He then tells me that he rang the doorbell, even went next door.....(I have no idea why he would say that - I had to sign for it, not them) and blah blah blah, heavy packages and I told him about the service and that i knew he was there. What he didn't know was that is was motion activated, not activated by someone ringing the doorbell. I said, you know, I never heard the doorbell. He changes the subject. After he left I got on my phone and saw him pull up and one minute, ONE MINUTE later I was at the door. I know this because the recordings have a time stamp. He never rang the doorbell. He didn't go next door. The camera would have caught that. He was a lazy postal worker that didn't want to have to carry boxes to our front door. And you go to the Canada Post website to complain about this, and they've got all kinds of choices and answers to questions but NOTHING about a lazy employee who won't carry a package to someone's door. Sometimes I have no choice but to use Canada post, so that means I have to catch them before they can drive away and claim I wasn't home. What recourse do I have?"
"Canada post are a bunch of liars and will not take accountability when they lose your parcel. Purolator handed parcel off to CP in Castlegar, confirmed with CP agent there. I live two hours away from that post office. Parcel was routed to Kelowna which is a little over an hour away. 4 Days later they can not tell me where my parcel is, still trying to say they didn't receive it from Purolator yet even though Canada Post's own website and their tracking tool shows Canada Post have received it and scanned it and its in transit. The senior resolution manager said to ignore their own tracking information and still sticking to the story they haven't received it yet. She has admitted that since she is in Ottawa and I'm in BC that she hasn't spoken to anyone locally. Clueless!! I do believe that this kind of attitude reflects leadership nobody cares just a bunch of lazy liars. Time to privatize Canada Post, no more tax payers funding this garbage corporation."
Garbage. Don't even bother paying for express service..I only ever use Canada Post when I'm forced to and I'd rather pay double the shipping amount to another courrier just to actually get my stuff on time. -5 stars
The worst delivery service in Canada. Very slow anrelilable and expensive.
"Canada post is really garbage, their scanning database doesn't show updates it takes 2 days to see where your package is, and they take long to ship your items, they lose your package, if you live in an apartment they don't use the buzzer instead they leave a notice card.

Reality is, we can complain all we want, every review we see online we all have the same problem and all of these complaints are A LOT, I know someone at Canada post head office is reading all these reviews about this government runned mailing company, are they going to do anything about it ?, no, do they care, no, because we're giving them loads of money they keep asking for because they think more money would improve the system. This is why when they protest, no one gives them sympathy because of how crap this company is."
"Just ordered from amazon. Canada post apparently attemped delivery. I set the delivery address to my work because its easier since someone is always there to accept packages. Well there was no sign of any attempted delivery. Now my package will show up tomorrow, hopefully. This is not the first time this has happened ive never received an order on time while dealing with canada post. Either they lie about attempting to deliver it or they send it to another location and i have to wait 24 hours to get it."
"I order packages from amazon weekly. When they use Canada post I find my parcels at the end of my driveway, delivery tags in hung in my front bush. I‚Äôll even be told my parcels have been delivered when there is no sign of them. They will jamb boxes that clearly won‚Äôt fit in my mail box. And worst of all I have watched several times as the delivery person chooses to put the ‚Äúwe tried to deliver tag‚Äù at my door without even attempting to deliver my package.
Figure your Crap out. This company is an absolute disgrace."
"A bunch of clowns.

""We‚Äôre the no. 1 parcel delivery company in Canada"" ??!

Can't even ship something without losing an arm..

Canada is a complete joke"
Horrible snail mail! Service sucks and I hate companies who use them as a delivery carrier.
Terrible service! Delivery is awful! Who leaves packages at doors anymore. Stuff is stolen all the time. Tracking numbers don‚Äôt work for service complaints and between online chat and phone they just try to send you back and forth! Love amazon! Love puralator. Can‚Äôt stand Canada post
"Only because I can't give a minus score. They lost my package which was sent Amazon prime. They accepted it in Edmonton but now don't know where it is and won't track it. Claim has to go to Amazon. Then they wonder why they lose business. They will not acknowledge that they have it and lost it. Had plenty of time to deliver before our wedding and now are too incompetent to fix their f#$#up. DO NOT USE THEM if it is important and you want it within a month. They jack up prices because of sales dropping...HERE is a no el idea - give better service, have reasonable delivery times & maybe people might actually use you. Canada Post is a joke that our tax payers pay for crappy service."
"The experience with Canada Post is garbage. How can someone pay extra money for delivery because of how important it is and snail mail arrives before. In any other organization, people would be fired over this. This has left my family stranded on vacation."
"Very very bad experience with this company. First they tell me they couldn‚Äôt deliver my order since I didn‚Äôt put the unit nbr (which is understandable on their part) and then these guys can‚Äôt even give me a correct time to expect it back after I updated my address (contacted CSR amazon all the way to India for them to tell me that they too couldn‚Äôt reach this company to provide the answer to where my order is and at what time I can expect it). They can‚Äôt even try to CONTACT you cause ‚ÄúThey are too busy delivering‚Äù. I also have a friend who got his electric guitar and speaker sets get thrown/delivered ON THE STREET!!! Can you imagine that? ON THE STREET!! No sense of responsibility form these guys! Also I recommend anyone not to use this shipping company unless they correct it and put people who really are gonna do their best to deliver our goods or at least contact us to come get them, not throw them on the street or returning it without providing exact time to when we can expect it again. Very disappointed!!!"
"If I could rate Canada Post 0, I would. Have lost multiple packages and refused to investigate because their system says it's been delivered. They offer no proof of these deliveries--other services will text you pictures. Canada Post probably refrains from doing this because they leave packages out in the open"
"Canada post continues to lose untracked mail and has no explanation, very unprofessional and pathetic. I am very tired of their tactics."
One of the worst government agencies in Canada..They simply do not care about improving service while raising postage rates..>GROSSLY incompetent and ANTI small business...They lost 3 pieces of my mail including a federal government cheque and took no responsibilty. I now try to avoid Canada POST services as much as possible.. TIME TO PRIVATIZE.
Pathetic and worst. You pay so much for registered mail (around double than purolator) and their website does not display the signature and wants extra fee just to see the signature. Please get some other courier service.
"Canada post is IRRESPONSIBLE and USELESS government agency. They lost or wrongly delivered my 100 bank cheques, thus compromising my bank account. If I find out that my Identity is stolen, I hold those XUYS RESPONSIBLE and I smear them internationally.

Such STUPID, ILLITERATE, GOOD FOR NOTHING ILLEGITIMATE DUMMIES."
"Despite a secure drop box for parcels at my apartment complex, Canada Post either leaves notes saying to go pick up the items since I ""wasn't home"" (never actually checks) or, far more often, just LEAVES THEM IN THE LOBBY WHERE ANYBODY CAN TAKE THEM.

Absolute waste of taxpayer dollars. Complete garbage. I wish I could leave a 0/5 star rating."
"Canada post in Shopers Dragmart,Centre Mall,Hamilton,have two amazing employees,who made my experience fantastic.Kristyn and Tracy. They were patient,helpful and pleasant.I am amazed. Thank You,and keep those girls happy,they deserve it."
"I have been missing my online purchased especially, jewelry since last year. These items showed delivered,but I never got them and am at home daily doing online university courses. I have complained to eBay about not getting my purchases of over 15 items.This is not the USA where people follow the post van and steal your online delivery. However, I was refunded for some of these items and I considered them lost in the mail. Shameful, today a resident of my neighbourhood found some of my deliveries in some clump of shrubs near his home. How can this be. These people are handsomely paid if they don't want the job then they should give it to someone else.I am so angry."
"WORST mail delivery ‚Äúservice‚Äù on the face of the earth.
The only thing I can ever rely on Canada post for - is f$*%g up my delivery.
When I pay the highest price you can pay to have something delivered, I expect the delivery to be made on time (exclusion for natural disasters).
Instead, my package is sitting at the local depot and won‚Äôt have a delivery attempt made. For some reason.
At the time, it was 9am. So apparently an 8 hour business day isn‚Äôt enough time to make a delivery. Because it‚Äôs friday, I have to wait until MONDAY before an attempt is made to deliver my package.
Easy fix though, I‚Äôll just drive to the depot and collect my package.
Nope, sorry, Canada post policy says they have to attempt the first delivery.
So you‚Äôre refusing to deliver my package and now refusing to let me pick it up so that I can wait for you to try and deliver it 3 days late.
Please explain that one to me.
This company is so dysfunctional on such a massive scale, I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how it‚Äôs possible that they are still in business.
The staff are typically abrasive, rude, disrespectful and have no care for performing their duties with integrity.
Shipments are late far more often then they are on time, the prices are an embarrassment and the rules would make the dumbest individual scratch their head in confusion.

I will never pay for this company to handle another item of mine for the rest of my life.
Ten years of bitter disappointment is enough for me, thanks.
You can‚Äôt fix this company. Fire every employee and burn it to the ground. Pi$$ on the ashes and then send in a nuke to be absolutely sure it‚Äôs gone."
The only carrier that doesnt meet their delivery estimate. Anything else is better
Very poor service... you can blame management who get all the bonuses.
These illiterate morons have twice misdirected my parcels because they can't read. Once they sent my parcel from Quebec going to Ontario for a nice scenic drive across Canada to B.C. and then had to fly it back to Ontario. Now these half-wits have a parcel originating in Sydney Australia showing coming from Sydney Germany. The shipper had the correct tracking info on their website and Canada Post had it all wrong. On top of that the shipper showed it clearing customs in Toronto for delivery in Ontario and then the feckless morons at Canada Post got a hold of it and redirected it to Quebec delaying delivery for a week. Of course this is considered business as usual for management who apparently do not care.
"Useless unreliable ""service"". I travel for work and need to obtain visas. The embassy in Ottawa mandates visa applications be made with Canada Post Courier service. Each of the three times I sent my application to the embassy from Calgary via the next day delivery guarantee, there has been a problem...first time delayed by a day... second time delayed by a day and this time...wait for it...yes delayed by two days! These delays cost me time, money, and reputation.. I would be out of business with this kind of service history."
Went to Cherry Hill post office to pick up delivery notice for my daughter who is a student in the US. Was refused and told she had to sign for it herself despite letter of authorization which CANADA POST advised me to do. Clerk was rude and condescending and did not offer any alternatives. I will never go back there! Very poor service and stupid policies for people who can‚Äôt go there.
"I get packages regularely through Canada Post and almost every time there is a problem of some kind. Pick up slips at the wrong door / missing, no delivery knock, sometimes 'out for delivery' and then the mail just vanishes. Trucks not dropping off my things for pick-up until well after 6pm. I wish there were other options for what I'm having delivered. Their customer service is atrocious and even their store-front employees are often curt and have an officious, dismissive, rude attitude. I wish it were possible to have a negative number for review instead."
"Horrible service. Packaging is usually damaged and now they buzz once, hang up on you and say the delivery failed. Sorry I was not running after the delivery truck. You seriously need to consider not offering services you cannot provide properly. So angry right now."
"There needs to be an option to give -10 starts, but even that wouldn't be enough. We've seen plenty of stories about Canada Post not delivering, lying about attempted delivery and blah blah blah. Mine is similar, but the monkey...I mean, ""delivery person,"" claimed they left a notice (according to the tracking info), but no notice was anywhere to be found. We have a guest who was in the living room all day, plus the doorbell can be easily heard from anywhere. Even footsteps at the porch and the door opening are easy to hear from the living room. So, the lazy piece of garbage lied. I contacted customer service and they said they'd file a compliant. Give me a break. With these unionized crybabies, the person will get a warning at best, then complain to their union rep and have it expunged. Never using these clowns again."
"I‚Äôm in uk! Seller is in Canada and shipped canadapost sent the item out 7 weeks ago. It‚Äôs still not here and cannot be found. Item worth $125CAD! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be buying from Canada again. Seller was really helpful but canadapost is an absolute joke. On the phone they said they can‚Äôt track it now because it‚Äôs in Europe, no description on where in Europe. And that was about 4 weeks ago. Things from Europe take a maximum of 8 days to get to me.. I think someone‚Äôs definitely stole my item like üôÑ my believe this, my first time buying from Canada and I know now I never wanna do it again. Such an expensive item lost. Was told it would take up to 2-3 weeks to arrive which would‚Äôve been to me in time for my birthday so not only did I not get the only present I wanted (bought for myself lol) but they completely lost it and there‚Äôs no way on they‚Äôre website to get any sort of claim? You can apparently only make claims for items sent within Canada. It tells me to make a claim with my postage company as it should be on my end by now. Newsflash it‚Äôs not in my country, they tell me to talk to canadapost to find the item as they sent it but Canada post just tell me to talk to my postage company... please for the love of god and all your precious online shopping... never, ever, use canadapost.
-10/10 ruined my birthday and never shipping with canadapost again."
"Sent a package from UK to Canada on 23rd July. Royal mail tracked it as far as leaving the UK and then it passes over to Canada post but from there, there is...Nothing!! It does not even show that it has arrived in Canada. I contacted Canada Post and was told 'Don't worry I am sure your package will arrive, but it may be stuck in customs' It MAY be stuck in customs, why don't they know because I paid for tracking so surely they should be able to find out where it is. What is the point of paying extra for tracking if Canada Post cannot be bothered. I sent another package on the same day to the USA and it arrived days ago and was tracked right to delivery so why can't Canada post do the same."
"I had 10 parcels sent from over seas so far 2 have arrived 2 have been returned to sender all from same company same labeling all have my phone number on them called customer service 4 times got absolutely no help or advice, asked one agent way no one called phone number on parcels she she that not what they do I mentioned to her that Canada posts site says they do everything they can to deliver mail she she that was not true that‚Äôs not their job ,so much for a company that pays them selves with may tax dollar if you were private you‚Äôd go bankrupt the next day ,and now I have to reorder and pay for my product again because of Canada post stupidity and laziness"
"Loveleen of the Semiahmoo Shoppers Drug Mart Post Office is one perfect postie. This young woman sees her work as more than a mere job. She allows one to call to see if there is a parcel with your name on it. Even though it is a busy site, she always takes time to be courteous and helpful. When my parcel that was sent by the company to the wrong address and could not be located, she gave phone numbers to call as we tried to track down where the parcel from the US would be. When I did find out from Canada Post main office where the parcel was, using the tracking number, she saw to it that it would be sent to her division because the location was too far for me to get to. She called them and asked it be sent to her at the local PO where I can go. When she arranged it, she called me back and arranged a day when I could come and pick up the package which contained an expensive item and had gone to the wrong address. Loveleen constantly is helpful no matter how complicated things are. A big thanks to her and to the Canada Postal Service. M. R, White Rock, BC"
"I just finished not so great online customer service with Canada Post. I am expecting my package today at condo. Since I wasn‚Äôt home and mailbox was too small . The driver should left me a notice card in my mailbox. Just checked it and nothing in it. Okay fine , the worse part came to me, why they dropped my package at post office almost half an hour drive from my home when there is a post office nearby (5 mins drive) . I was speechless üò∂"
"Canada post is a joke. Got off the phone with a complete moron that couldn‚Äôt help.
Winnipeg‚Äôs moray depo should be closed because the lack of intelligence at that place.

Can someone shut down Canada post and have a more reliable delivery service."
"Living in different provinces I conclude that the quality of the service depends on delivery person in almost 100% and this is not specific for this service but for any service. There are hardworking professionals and less concerned lazy workers, everywhere. With a lazy postie we had repetitive issues like notices left without attempt to deliver or parcels left to pick up in farer pick up point. We spent lots of time to figure out where our parcels were, same for our neighbors. Since we got another Canada Post employee, the service is PERFECT, again. For those who are having issues, don`t hesitate to complain by chat or phone. If this does not work, escalate and talk directly to supervisor. They should be aware what`s wrong and to fix it asap."
"The WORST company ever!!
Here‚Äôs a piece of advice: Just go to dhl/ups/fedex and save yourself a headache. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth the extra pay.
thank me later."
"Canada Post is an ancient company that needs to be shut down already. Please tell me how in 2019, with all of the technology available, that CANADA POST, a company whose sole purpose is to deliver mail and parcels, cannot tell me any information about my package or why after two weeks from the anticipated delivery date, the parcel is being sent back to AUSTRALIA. Canada Post is a complete joke and its only a matter of time before the entire operation gets shut down and streamlined into a properly running service."
"THE WORST. I work from home and they never deliver my packages. They pretend to try by leaving the little slip on the door (sometimes) but usually I have to just show up at my local post office looking for my missing package. They don't buzz or deliver to my door, or even try. YOU'RE A DELIVERY SERVICE - THAT'S YOUR ENTIRE JOB. ugh so irritating."
"I've been living at the same address for 35 years, last week I get a notice saying my address is not visible from the street so they are suspending my mail delivery.Really? for the last 35 years they could find my house, which by the way there are only 10 houses on this small street. The mailman is very petty, he even left me as note one time when my green garden hose was lying across my walkway and it was a hazard, only an fool couldn't see it. God when are we going to sell this money losing privileged business?"
"I paid Canada Post to stop my mail for two weeks. Now I‚Äôm back, and three days after the stop date, no mail at all arrived. There should have been a hefty pile of mail. They supposedly deliver every week day, but that doesn‚Äôt happen in Toronto‚Äîevery second day if we‚Äôre lucky. They should honestly state that they don‚Äôt deliver on a daily basis."
"It's sad that you have to depend upon a good few amongst a sea of indifference at Canada Post. Since our delivery person changed, nothing is even attempted to be delivered now - just a card in the community mailbox stating it needs to be collected tomorrow.

Happened again today - card said 'signature & ID, gate'. We were all at home and my Nest cam shows that the delivery driver didn't even approach the gate.

Best thing you can do is call them and complain. Am doing that now and they are quite receptive - the chap on the phone even described the practice as 'quite dirty', lol."
"Terrible service
Terrible service. Package gets from China to Vancouver quicker than it gets from Mississauga to East York. Then when it‚Äôs finally out for delivery it does not arrive 6 days of calling and creating service tickets which are a joke my package is in NB instead of East York. Now finally after 13 days package is again out for delivery. No delivery instead tracking information shows delivery card in community box. I was sitting here waiting no delivery man and no card. Called post office they said sorry they will create another ticket. They claim there was no name on package then how did they leave delivery notice. The least they could do is figure out their lazy lies. Since I had 2 service tickets for same problem decided to try the ombudsman. Well that is the biggest joke off all. If you want a paycheck and don't do any work become the postal ombudsman."
Terrible service. Package gets from China to Vancouver quicker than it gets from Mississauga to Milton. Then when it‚Äôs finally out for delivery Mailman is lazy and doesn‚Äôt even try to see if you are home he just leaves the delivery card in the community mailbox - watched him do it several times.
"Hands down, Canada Post Toronto is probably the worst postal service in the world.
I ship to 30 countries around the world from the UK and Canada Post Toronto is consistently late delivering Royal Mail packages, causing my customers continued frustration, and hampering my ability to operate my business
Thanks for the continued let down, you guys should be proud of yourself and the accolade
An absolute shambles and a continued embarrassment.
üëè"
Worst courier ever! On their website it says that we will receive it at the end of the day today (Friday) but when I called them they said it‚Äôs gonna be on Monday cause there‚Äôs a delay in SK.. that Parcel is very important! Cause we‚Äôre gonna be needing that this coming Sunday! I SWEAR I WANNA PUNCH THEM ON THE FACE!
"This company is honestly laughable. The consistency with how and when they deliver packages is severely lacking. I usually make the same order about every month or so and it usually always takes two days but sometimes it will take 3 which is kind of annoying seeing as the previous 20 times it's shown up in 2 and then all of the sudden its 3. This lack of consistency needs to stop, it's unacceptable for a company that's as big as Canada Post to be this inconsistent I shouldn't be randomly waiting 3-5 days for a package I know is suppose to arrive in two it's extremely inconvenient and if I could switch companies I would but sadly these morons possess a monopoly in Canada so I have to deal with their stupidity. I Really hope that the Canadian government makes it easier for competition to enter because I am fed up with how Canada post chooses to operate their business."
"I ship/get about 1000 packages a year and all generally get to where they are going. Many people here giving poor reviews are not being straightforward. I see it all the time, they show up at the post office without I.D. to claim packages, they wait beyond the send-back date to go pick them up. Then they blame the post office. Also, most are still doing the old hand-written forms to ship when they should be going online since Customs now require a form. In addition, if the package is insured, it's a fairly straight-forward process to make a claim, though it can take time. Pricing at Canada Post is competitive but not terrific. If you ship internationally, there are considerably cheaper and reliable alternatives."
"Never live up to their guarantees. But when you are a government run company, carrying about their customers is far from their priority"
Ottawa-Montreal is only 2 hours by car but a delivery of a single letter between these two cities takes more than a week. And I'm still waiting for that letter to be be delivered and nobody can tell me when it gets here. How can it be that an international post delivery within Europe takes two to three days and Canada Post cannot get it on time or even close to the the estimated delivery time? Never again!!!
"If you're shopping online, and the shipping method shows up as Canada Post, IMMEDIATELY CANCEL that order.
I've ordered from multiple online retailers (etailers) such as Amazon, ebay, Newegg, Bestbuy, etc., and when Canada Post is delivering, at least a quarter of those orders were (partially) lost and half of those orders were late or had issues!
At least the remaining quarter of the time, they deliver properly, right?...
Typical of any government backed corporations (ie. Crown corporations), they wouldn't survive in the private sector with their lazy/inefficient and complacent operation."
"BAD service. They don't do ANY attempts to deliver. They say: you have a community mail box, that's why we don't deliver you parcels to the door. But we have the mail box only for 3 months, when we didn't have mail box - they still never made attempts to deliver! They are not very shy of it. lazy, LAZY people. Read the script between CP and me: A
I do apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, if you regular mode of delivery is to a mailbox that is where the items will be delivered.
A
I do apologize.
I
I contacted the sender - they don't have the request to leave in a mail box
A
That does not have anything to do with the sender.
A
The only way items will be delivered to your door is if you have door to door delivery. If you have a mailbox, it will always be delivered to your mailbox.
I
No, I always receive items by Purolator at the door
I
plus, there is NO space for all 5 packages in mail box
A
That is purolator. Not Canada Post.
A
We will not leave them in the mailbox if they are large. We will leave a delivery notice card indicating where and when to pick up the item.
I
why canadapost doesn't deliver items properly to people?
A
We do deliver items properly.
A
You do not have door to door delivery unfortunately.
I
How do you know ?
I
Do you know my address?
A
You said you have a mailbox, that means that you do not have door to door delivery.
A
If you have a mailbox, then you do not have door to door delivery.
A
You are also requesting for this service.
I
I did not request. All I need to deliver items I ordered to me personally. I am home and can not walk after the surgery, I can not drive
A
Yes, that is requesting for the items to be delivered to your door. Unfortunately, we do not do that. I apologize.
Canada Post"
"The mailman said packages for me were in his truck and that he would be right back, He never came back, left no notice YET said on the tracking site that he left a notice. Liar.. People like you give the good folks at Canada Post a bad reputation."
"Had an international package shipped to me two weeks ago, after not delivering my package on the day they were supposed to they re scheduled delivery for the next day. I personally watched the delivery person go to the building beside mine (wrong address as listed by the numbers on the building) then marked it as an incomplete address. Now they are sending it back to the original sender (in Germany) and making me pay the duty and taxes twice for the package. I contacted their support line only for them to tell me that its impossible to stop the package from being sent back to the originally shipper, even though it was 100% their fault due to laziness that my package was never delivered in the first place. What a disgrace canada post is. Their customer service seems like its run by pre-schoolers and their delivery team seem to not be able to see clearly visible address numbers on the front of buildings, which is literally their only job on a day to day basis. What a disgrace and waste of time and money. Ill be making sure to tell all my friends and family about the situation to ensure they don't get ripped off as well by the incompetent Canada Post."
"I am constantly having to report no mail for three days... they never do anything to solve the issue, or they half assed solve it, only for things to revert back to how they were a few months later. They need to get their act together. I have been expecting something important, job related, by mail that was supposed to arrive days ago but bc this place cannot seem to hire anyone who truly WANTS TO DO THEIR JOB CORRECTLY, I am still waiting!!!!! Worst service ever!!!!! They are LUCKY TO GET THE STAR THAT I DID GIVE THEM!!!"
"""Lost"" my package again. Says out for delivery for 9 days straight. I appreciate some companies are not using Canada Crap anymore. Chapters/Indigo is using a different courier now. And I got that package in 2 days!"
Amazon 2 Day Delivery useless when it comes to these bassoons. I'm so done with this company it's actually insane to think they would hire any dunce with legs and arms to handle packages so easily but yet still fail to crawl with their baby legs attached to their brains. I'm so sick of youuuuu guysss losing my packages and now I have to wait even LONGER for a package that was in my town literally babysteps away to my house and FAIL to deliver a package to the ACCORDDING address.
Makes too much mistakes. Not reliable not convenient. If you can avoid do everything you can.
"Sometimes they're good, sometimes not so good. Depends on who you get that's serving your area and how much they do/don't care."
"Ripped me off my money
international parcel sent broken
my mom need walker badly
they sent 1000s of email to my family insuring about packaging
and in end nothing reimbursed
Never again I use international service
And never recommends any of my friend or family"
"Terrible service. Always late and the tracking is never accurate at all. Prince George B.C. Items sent from Richmond to Victoria BC and then back to Richmond BC again for no reason. Very lazy delivery staff for rural deliveries. Would not knock on my front door to deliver my parcel because of an excuse that there is a downspout in the way , yet they only had to walk 2 feet around it with a clear and un- obstructed path to the door, in the summer with no snow or ice. I watched her pull up and then drive away. Tracking says package delivered but yet no parcel pickup slip in the mailbox and usually get the parcel pickup slip the next day after I have already picked up the parcel. Already had one item damaged with forklift tire tracks across the top of the parcel and was 2 weeks late. Was sent a wet and filthy apology slip in the mailbox. This happens on a regular basis here in Prince George. This is the poorest service in Canada by far. Any chance I get I will request other delivery options from now on."
"Same problem here, from receiving end I got a priority mail that was supposed to arrive in 2 days and it‚Äôs still sitting in Calgary over the weekend and nobody can find it.
Sent out on the July 10 and today July 15 still in transit with live bees in it. From Guelph ON to lethbridge AB. What a shame. They disgust me.
Never used their crappy services."
"On the receiving end (Airdrie, AB) of an express post sent from Langley, BC. My client assures me that 2-3 days it will be here as she PAID a PREMIUM price to get the package moving quick. It was sent on Monday, July 8th, it's now Saturday, July 13th and I still have nothing. Called in to a crappy customer service automation system and spoke to a woman who then proceeded to re-identify my name because somehow that information wasn't already in the system based on the tracking identifier I provided? It's upsetting and shows a lack of commitment to true ethical Canadian business practise. I'm going to advise my future clients to use another service. Pathetic!"
Don‚Äôt use them. Always late.
Purchased an item that was sent through canada post and it's been 2 months and still havnt recieved it... China mail sends stuff faster & in 30 days... I'm in Australia... what a disgrace
"Canada post so expensive and getting more expensive bad customer service .
They are just losing people's legal documents and everything you mail."
Thunder Bay mail delivery is NOT everyday ‚Äò it‚Äôs maybeeee twice a week ! Glad I pay taxes for daily mail delivery that no one receives üò°
Canada Post couldn‚Äôt deliver a parcel if you stood on the street and stopped the truck in front of your house. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs being contracted out or if they have new agents that can‚Äôt read or are excessively lazy.
"Canada post is run by lazy and uneducated workers who don‚Äôt respect the time and value of others‚Äô belongings. If they are going to constantly demand better wages and benefits, maybe they should do their jobs correctly instead of sitting around pouting and wining all day. I paid for 2 day GUARANTEED express shipping for a very time sensitive document and they somehow had it sitting at the processing station for 3 days, making it late for the deadline. The workers are completely incompetent and have no initiative whatsoever to do their job. I am extremely disappointed. If you need ANYTHING delivered, DO NOT use Canada Post! They will either lose your package or deliver it late."
"After reading all the previous reviews, I'm quite concerned about my parcel that has been sitting at Canada posts Mississauga sorting facility since Friday. What is unacceptable is the fact that every time I call or email customer service to check on the status of my order, they put it on customs, stating that the item is still with customs and that they can't do anything about it! While the truth is that I was told by customs official that the parcel is with Canada Post since Friday, just as I see on the USPS's website. At some point employees must be held accountable for their slacking and lack of professionalism even if they work for the government! So if a parcel does not get delivered or gets lost Canada Post and people responsible must cover the entire cost of it! The poor service is only because there's no consequences."
"I have been sitting here all day waiting for a parcel from Canada Post. I tracked it and it said it was out for deliver at 7:58, then back for redirection to the customer's ""new"" address at 8:12. Then it was out for delivery again. Well, I never received it today so I phoned Canada Post. What a joke, you have to maneuver through a maze of ""Choose 1 for..."" and most end with ""Open up a ticket at CanadaPost.ca"". It took forever for me to figure out how to get a real person on the phone. Now for some background info. This is the third problem in the last couple of weeks. We weren't getting mail at our community box, along with everyone else in our close. When I contacted Canada Post, some moron in Eastern Canada told me that the reason we weren't getting service was because of the wild fires. Well the wild fires are almost 900 km away from our community. Then we were told that the lock was broken on the box. (It wasn't.). Today when I had two other parcels delivered to our door, I asked the carrier why we weren't getting service. He told me the regular fellow retired but they can't hire someone new until he uses up his holidays and sick leave which would take weeks. In the mean time we get poor to no service. When I pointed out to the person on the phone that deliveries don't start until 9 and supposedly my parcel today was out for delivery at 7:58, back for redirection at 8:12, and then out again he told me that the seller must have paid extra for the redirection. The seller is in China. But no one at Canada Post cares about their reviews or they would do something about it. I have never seen a review for anything this poor before."
"XpressPost is the worst I have seen in 40 years of shipping. When they say your package is ""in transit"", it means their employees are checking it to see if they will steal it or not. I have lost 1200.00$ in shipping since January 2019 with Canada Crap. I tell all my distributor and sales people to use other carriers or I order elsewhere. Maybe within a few months or a year, we'll be rid of the THIEVES from the government. Boycott the fraudulent practices from Canada Post that don't even follow their own LAWS, take a look at them, they are infringing their own laws."
"USE PUROLATOR!!!
Canada post says they ‚Äútried to deliver‚Äù they just do that so they don‚Äôt have to walk up the stairs or whatever"
Garbage service!! Do not waste your time with these bunch of clowns!!! 1 delivery chance is all you get for delivery. Complete garbage service!!! Try and reschedule another delivery because I was not home. customer service rep says only get one chance for delivery. Now I have to go out of my way and pick up my parcel that I paid for!!! My personal belonging!!!!Take time out of my day!!! Customer service at canada post is at the complete bottom of the barrel!!! Save your money and find another way of sending your items. Great to see our tax dollars at work!!!! No wonder canada post is failing.
"Day nine of a two day delivery. This is the third time in three months. Canada Post could unironically ruin someone's business , because they lie about their expected dates with brazen disregard for their customers or those customers' interests. ""Can I come pick it up?""
""No sir, you cannot pick up from depot, because we are so utterly incapable of running a delivery service that finding your box in our small depot and then handing it over physically after wasting 7 days of my f---cking time is beyond us."""
Two worst possible companies Canadapost and USPS came together to make sure I do not receive my package on time even though I paid for two days priority. Terrible service. Use UPS and save yourself the headache.
"Where do I start? I'm waiting for a parcel with contents that are of value to me. It was supposed to be delivered today. I'm getting worried because Canada Post LOST (or had stolen?) 5 separate items I ordered from Amazon in the past 6 weeks. If my handbag doesn't arrive soon, that will be 6! How does ANY mail delivery company maintain itself when it fails on its core mandate 6/6 times? I've received 0/6 packages I ordered in the past 6 weeks!!!! How is that even possible? And the mail delivery charge for the latest was $35.00. And we pay for this also as taxpayers??? I used to be against privatizing the post office, but Canada Post seems like one sick puppy. They should be privatized, and some people need to be fired. Fedex is much better and often less expensive. I will not buy anything from Amazon or eBay again if they use Canada Post."
They never deliver packages to your door. Defeats the purpose of shipping when you have to pick it up.
"paid expedited shipping still hasnt been delivered in 1 week. I call them to ask when it will be delivered they say monday now. Same parcel was delivered in 2 days with UPS and with canadapost it takes a week. I am sick and tired of Canadapost.
I have been sitting at home waiting for this parcel since yesterday cause they system said it will be delivered yesterday. Then around 7pm it changed to tomorrow. Now we are at the end of the day and i call in to check what is the update, they are saying monday. How ignorant are you people! Fix your stupid system. I live downtown, my package was in Mississauga now they moved it to Scarborough. Worst service in the history of packaging. I would have chosed UPS if they had the option to chose it when i made my purchase!"
"This isn't the first time I had a bad experience with Canada Post delivery. Today I had a parcel marked as out for delivery. I waited all day, put my life on hold to wait for this parcel. I didn't want to do anything incase I missed hearing my buzzer, I waited patiently all damn day. I had been tracking my order all day online. It was 645pm I checked again to track my package only to find out i got a delivery attempt notice at 640pm and it said 'no one was home'. Like how F'n dare you! I was sitting right by my door and not one attempt was made by Canada Post to let me know they showed up. They didn't Buzz my door or knock. They didn't try to do anything. It's so aggrivating. Now I have to wait all weekend to go pick it up on Monday. Thanks a lot post office. Your workers are lazy ."
"Canada Post sucks!! Guaranteed delivery means nothing to them. You pay extra to express post and ensure on time delivery and it sits at the processing station on the other end. I called them to see why it wasn't delivered and they have no answer. It just didn't get delivered. These were important documents that had to get there. When I went to the post office I requested priority. The clerk said it would be the same delivery date to go Express post, so I listened to the clerk. The Customer service area can't do anything about it. I have learned my lesson. Next time it will be ups or purolator. Canada post doesn't care."
You guys are not taking your work seriously and do not care what customers think.
"If I could give Canada post a negative rating I would. We paid $150.00 to ship a ski jacket to Australia only to find out that the shipping time would be 3 months!!! Seriously, are we living in dinosaur ages? What's it coming by!!? I only wish now that I had used one of the big courier companies, the price would have been similar but no doubt would have had it in days. Off to the snow next week and still no jacket to take. Will never use again."
"Overall rating for Canada Post is 0.5 stars....How can a company /service even have less than 1 star? LOL ? When the lowest rating possible is 1 star? so how they managed that is beyond me. But they don't even deserve that 0.5 of a star, should be -500 stars. Lying sob's. never even attempt to deliver anything. They leave an 'attempted delivery ' notice...they just take a wild guess that I'm not home... Meanwhile IM ON MATERNITY LEAVE AND LITERALLY NEVER LEAVE MY HOUSE. it's happened like, more than 20 times in this year alone. Too lazy to get on a an elevator? Give me a break . Then it gets ""sent"" to a shoppers that's on the other side of town, like the furthest possible f'n place , and it's not available for pickup for like 2 days. UGHHH. is there a way to like, opt out of ever using Canada Post? I only want competent people handling my mail. .. like why do company's like intelcom, FedEx, ups, dhl, etc have no issues? Hey never be screw up anything or try and b.s. their way out of doing their job and delivering my mail?! Why TF ur always on strike is beyond me ....what a mf'n joke! Ur lucky your even employed.

F CANADA POST!"
"I ordered a watch off of eBay several days ago. The price of the watch was very reasonable. But, when the postage was added in, it was nearly $16.00 more. I thought that was unreasonable. At the same time, I thought at least I'll get the watch in a couple of days. Then, I found out it was going to take Canada Post 2-weeks or more to deliver it to my home in the United States. Why is Canada Post so expensive and yet so slow to deliver? I have been reading all of these bad comments about Canada Post and I am worried about if and when I will receive my order. If I knew this before hand, I probably wouldn't have purchased the watch! But, I didn't know anything about Canada Post and I definitely didn't know it was going to be that expensive and take forever to get here, if it gets here! won't purchase anything from China because their mail service is just as bad. I'll know better next time."
"If zero stars was an option, then I would definitely select that many to describe my experience with Canada Post. I missed my package this morning, and received a notice on my door saying to pick it up at 6:00 pm. Great, no problem. Come 6:00, I go to my nearest Canada Post office, and it's only there I'm told that I have to wait a whole day before I can retrieve my parcel. Why it never said that on the note is beyond me, and I am honestly pretty bloody annoyed by this. The company should be more specific with times during these situations. That way, they might not actually be hated by so many people (myself included). Get your act together. Your supposed to be the leading mail service of Canada."
My letter mail is always late now. WHY. Get more trucks so you can keep up. I myself will be using Fed Ex for all my mail and parcels. You held us hostage at Christmas and now you continue with poor service .
"Literally the worst delivery service out there. They don‚Äôt even do their jobs and deliver packages/ consistent notices left even when you‚Äôre home and buzz them in. Lazy, terrible customer service."
"Canada post xpresspost to the States is really, really bad.
Guaranteed 3-4 business days, it‚Äôs been a week and the tracking says that it‚Äôs just cleared Customs.
What an incredible rip off.
Do NOT pay for the supposedly fast service."
"It‚Äôs unbelievable how substandard Canada post is, I‚Äôve lost more packages and even received packages that weren‚Äôt even mine on a regular bases. Why anybody with half a brain would use this postal service is beyond me. What a joke!"
Supposed to have a package delivered today and now it's not coming until tuesday at the latest when I paid extra to have it DELIVERED TODAY!!! BUNCH OF SCAMMING LOSERS! Have a nice long overpaid weekend you bums
"Is there even a point in adding another bad review in this great sea of unhappy customers? As a small shop owner, Canada Post is the major single point of frustration running a business that requires a courier. It‚Äôs such shame that our national shipping provider offers such substandard service, overcharges, undelivers, and basically steals from customers with ‚Äúunknown‚Äù reasons for undelivered packages. Why isn‚Äôt this part of any party‚Äôs platforms in elections? This company brings shame to our country. :("
When it comes to delivery in rural route they drop off when they want!! I have a package that was supposed to be here Wednesday and it‚Äôs now Friday and the mail man just passed me by!! Have a nice long weekend you overpaid lazy asses!!
"Can I put zero stars?
Do not send documents, especially if they are going to another country, and especially if they are your immigration/legal documents. Not only they lost my mother's documents, but because they were documents there is no coverage. I repeat again: DO NOT SEND IMMIGRATION/LEGAL DOCUMENTS with this embarrassing company. If you send your passport and it gets damaged, there is no cover; if you send legal-consul documents that can cost you up to $200, do not send them with Canada Post. Take your money and your documents right up your behind, because they will be safe there that with Canada POT."
"I sent a parcel internationally and it was sent into the wrong country. They denied that it‚Äôs not under insurance coverage because it‚Äôs not demaged and I, the sender, has received it back. Only the sending fee is refunded, and that‚Äôs it. No other compensation for the time I wasted to go there to drop off the item and all the money I wasted on buying that item as well. it‚Äôs a gift for a friend I really appreciated a lot, and I don‚Äôt even need it myself yet they clamied they can do nothing about it but apology. Genuinely disappointed."
"Delivery man is not nice at all. I was late opening the door because I was with my baby in the backyard. When I finally opened, he told me its a waste of time for them and that how come I didn't hear it. Not very nice."
Ive waited over a month for a custom made mug that they lost. They never contacted me back when they said they would and when walmart had resent the mug to them they placed my orderon hold for no reason !?
Horrible service. Online chat with Bert all he used was copie paste to speak with me. ret ar ded people there
"This is a horrible corporation. I was expecting a delivery and there was a postal code error. Rather than attempting to correct it, CPC chose not to deliver. I had to contact the sender, which then contacted CPC to open a ticket before a correction was made. It was on a Friday. The following Monday was a holiday. Obviously, CPC did not care at all about the delay that would entail. Not Customer-oriented. Worse courier service. Is it believable that it would take that many days to correct the last 3 digits of a postal code by CPC? And when you call their customer service, all you are served is "" There is nothing we can do""."
"Absolutely horrible. Avoid at all costs if you care about what you are shipping, when it should arrive, or getting help if something goes wrong.

Would rate 0/5 if possible."
"with horrible shipping times, horrible customer service and horrible shipping qualitys, it would be better to use any of the other much better shipping services around canada."
"Canada Post Neglects to Inform Residents of Theft from Post Office Boxes.

On June 2nd our neighbourhood post box in, Nanoose Bay was compromised and mail was stolen. It is now June 20th and after a call to the local post office we are just discovering this fact since we were curious as to why no one received the annual residential tax statement in the mail.

The Post Office reported the theft to the RCMP on June 3rd.

The Post Office, to this date, has still neglected to inform any residents that a breach of the mailboxes has occurred. Sensitive personal information may have fallen into the hands of unscrupulous individuals leaving residents at risk of identity theft and more. Canada Post should be required to immediately notify residents of such a security breach.

In order to understand the extent of this issue it would be very helpful if readers of this post could share any relevant information. Packages are going missing and not being reported. How much mail is being stolen? Let's hear your story."
"Sent a very important document via Canada Post express and was told it would be there next business day which was a Monday. Parcel did not arrive until Thursday causing undue express. Both the teller and the initial person I dealt with did not tell me that in actuality the package did not have to arrive until Wednesday! Even so it did not arrive until Thursday. Although the on line tracking showed it had been delivered at 2:30 pm, at 3:00 pm i rec'd an email stating that the parcel had NOT been delivered!!??? Never again will i send sensitive information via CP."
"The online shipping and customer service is extremely frustrating and horrible. We are a business and I created a shipping label. I accidentally clicked COD instead of insurance. The check boxes are super close and I entered $700.00 value. The customer phoned and said they have to pay $700 from Canada Post to receive the goods they ordered from us.

I made the mistake and said I will fix. When I called Canada Post to explain what had happened. They said they can't fix it. The customer HAS to pay the $700. I said I would pay it at our local PO and get them to send the parcel so the customer can receive the good. No can do. We went to a higher up supervisor and they hung up. The customer couldn't even phone and refuse shipment. They had to go into the PO office where the parcel is being held. So. We have no insurance. We cannot undo the COD. The customer can't refuse shipment. We have to wait 15 days till there is no pickup. We have to pay to ship it back. We cannot add insurance on the way back, unless (me) the sender has to get on a plane travel to where the parcel is. Pay the $700 in person. Then create another shipment label to add insurance. ???????????"
"Something's fishy!

Had the same problem as some others here. Ordered at least 100 items from China in one day and about 70 came in. All small packets. The weirdest thing is, is that I ordered 9 rings from 4 different companies and not one came in not to mention the other 21 items. I find that something is odd with that picture The sellers gave me tracking numbers and it last showed that the items were in Canada and that was in March. Luckily all the sellers gave me refunds but still where are the 30 items I am missing. I contacted Canada Post and basically asked what kind of security they have in their outlets and they told me they have cameras but these packets are very small and could easily be ""tucked away"" when nobody is looking. It happens everyday at Walmart and grocery stores and they not only have cameras but security guards. I personally believe that sometimes in certain outlets they pocket the item once they read the description. I have asked sellers now to type in a different description like ""gift"". Maybe this time I will get the 50 items I ordered since May 23rd. Then again maybe I will get half. Something really has to be done about Canada Post like an internal investigation to see what's really going on."
"Purchased a phone from Google and it gets shipped by Canada Post from Ontario to Calgary. Its taking over a week to here and the tracking system is complete garbage. All it shows is out for delivery with no change in status. I was home all day with the front door open and the drivers are so damn lazy they just through the door knocker package sticker in the mailbox and dont even come to the door even though a signature is required. I go to the post office to pick up my parcel and they still dont have it.

Canada post is such a joke. Why the government wastes their money with this service and caving into these lazy unions when there job is so easy now a days just driving around and tossing stuff in the communal mailboxes for the neighborhood is beyond me. Dont waste your time effort money on this garbage service from Canada Post. Just dismantle the entire corporation and privatize it. What a joke."
Never delivered online order to home. False attempt. Every time had to collect from post office.
"Garbage carrier, zero star.they don't give a damn about customers. Worst customer service. They have lost 7 items that I sold online during past 4 months. One of them was a new iphone xr value 1050 dollars, and when I call them and ask them what happened to my package, they speak to me as if it was my fault that the item was lost. I had both tracking and signature confirmation for the package, but they still can not provide delivery confirmation.
I will never ship expensive items with these , rude, unprofessional, annoying,lazy and incompetent garbage carrier.
I hope you read this canada post, and care about your customers.Atleast you can educate your employees to be respectful and improve their customer service abilities.
Canadian are too nice that they don't complain about you, if you were in US you would have to pay millions of dollars each year to settle court cases."
"Just had a bad experience with customer services. I mailed a jersey to my friend on March 18 2019. It‚Äôs been almost three month. My friend still not received that yet. Didn‚Äôt purchase the tracking number. So I was actually calling to see if there is any other way we can find my package. The guy on the phone with accent telling me without the tracking number, Canada post won‚Äôt be responsible for any lost and explain to me say if the receiver lied to me by telling me he never got the package. Not really impressed about how he deal with customer and will never used Canada post again"
"Walmart sent me a package and Canada Post delivered it to different person (receiver). I didn't receive the package. Very bad service, they are just wasting the money of the tax payers..."
"During January and February 2019, I placed 44 small orders from online Chinese merchants. 25 of these have NEVER arrived (after 17 to 23 weeks.) Notably, of these orders, ALL 25 (which never arrived), were shipped by an 'economical' service, while ALL but one of the remaining orders were shipped by 'standard air mail' or equivalent.

It is QUITE clear that canada post has chosen NOT to deliver these cheap 'economical' parcels. These were all LEGALLY purchased, from reputable merchants, and are my property. Whatever reasons or excuses canada post has for this failure to deliver ... deliberately depriving me of my property ... is theft.

canada post has a longstanding reputation for being a greedy, uncaring, and incompetent organization. Now ... it seems they are also criminals."
"I give Canada Post a 1 star rating because they could have taken responsibility and give me an instruction on how to make a claim for expedited parcel. Basically, a had a parcel delivered for a next day delivery; the Vendor put the right information but Canada Post (as per the agent information) sorting office placed the parcel on the wrong truck and needed to be rerouted back to the sorting office; so it can be placed on to the right delivery truck.

However, when I asked the agent if the error was done at the sorting office, Danielle (agent) said, I don't know I can only tell you what I see on my information sheet.

Here is Danielle's exact reply:
""""Yes, I had advised we had put it on the wrong truck. I am just not going to say that is exactly what happened because I do not know that information.""""

So even thou Danielle said it was placed on the wrong truck. She is still not claiming on behalf of Canada Post that the parcel was sorted incorrectly by an employee of Canada Post.

So is this how they trained their employees to avoid taking responsibility on behalf of the company?"
Lost our 2 parcels & one mail consisting of $7 $$.
"Canada post is an absolute joke, all they do is apologize and don't know where my package is, oh it's enroute, NO ACCOUNTABILITY, what a bunch of smelly TURDS"
I couldn't give 0 stars.... its absolutely the most garbage carrier ever!!! Do not use it ‚Ä¶. you are better off driving to the next city and using DHL instead. All they say is they apologize and have no control over it.... classic!!! Paid an arm and a leg and 20 business days later the item has still not reached its destination while they claim 6-10 business days. Spare yourself the pain. Learn from my ‚Ä¶ actually many peoples mistake. NEVER again. Clearly these reviews dont make any difference to canada post... reading these reviews.... and still no improvement.
"Absolutely the WORST carrier. Delivery people are consistently lazy, and instead of actually delivering packages, they'll just leave a notice for you to go get your items yourself. Shipping times drag along at a glacial pace, whenever they feel like moving things I guess. Prices are high, accountability is low. Plus they strike constantly, crippling small businesses. They're the worst, and I highly advise bigger companies (like Amazon) to boycott them."
"They do not even deserve one star. This company is the worst business I have ever been forced to use.

Last Monday a parcel of mine was marked as delivered. I checked the mailbox that day and just figured they needed until the end of the day (even though it was marked as delivered). I checked back every day and finally went into my post office on Friday to ask what was going on. I also started an online ticket through their phone line as well. They are still unable to find the package but will not proceed with the investigation until the sender issues a ticket as well.
The sender will NOT start an investigation because my package was confirmed ""delivered"". They claim they are off the hook because the package was delivered, which makes sense. They did their duty and Canada Post failed to do theirs. So now I am in a loop because Canada Post will not proceed without the sender and the sender will not proceed any further.
So I got a form from the sender that requires a notarized signature from the post office in general. Then I have to send this form back to them and hope they will do something. Which in my opinion, they should not have to do. Canada Post should be liable for losing my package, since they were the ones to lose it. Pretty straight forward.
Lastly, the receiver basically has no rights. I can not proceed with the investigation on my own and I can not make a formal complaint, because I am not the sender. Why can only senders complain about the service? And why are they liable for Canada Post's inability to handle mail?
Honestly I hope this company goes under. I would much prefer to pay money and have my parcel actually arrive with another company. Canada Post should be ashamed of it's policies and lack of accountability. No other business would be able to run like this.

I honestly can't over how I can not make a complaint about the services that are provided for me without being a sender. This is absolute trash and makes it seem like they do not care to change at all.

WORST SERVICE EVER."
"Been waiting for a package to deliver since last week. It's been ""Out for Delivery"" for multiple weekend and business days. I contacted CP 3 times with absolutely no answers, help or any updates on what they called ""a missing package"". Finally today I got in touch with the intended receiver, great guy, and he had in fact received the package days ago, but the delivery driver forgot to get a signature (that was a paid extra service) and forgot to update the delivery status to delivered... I chose ""Signature Required"" so I wouldn't get screwed by any mishaps and yet they still managed to screw me some how. Delivery driver had 3 tasks, drop off the package, get a signature, update the status. 5 days later and still hasn't done 2 of the 3 tasks. I spent days contacting CP with nothing resolved and did their job at the end of the day. Still waiting for the delivery to be confirmed to have my funds released, and I was told I can call back another time to see if I can get any sort of refund, even for the extra I paid for the signature requirement... Right when I think their service can't get worse, it does."
"Express from B.C. to Alberta SEVEN DAYS!! Package gets sent back to B.C. because. Canada post doesn't bother its self just the customer. And an address issue cant resolved on their part. I Provided email and phone contacts so don't call me or anything just ship it back to B.C. Loomis Express has more brains, and I hope you know how stupid loomis is ."
"From neighbourhood couriers not bringing packages to lighten their personal loads, to the tracking system being less than accurate, and every issue in between, I‚Äôve experienced it all. I do plenty of business online, both selling and buying, and I always have to contact about packages, letters and never provided with reasonable answers or reasons. In my last 10 shipments, I‚Äôve had 9 issues. Absolutely nothing is consistent, one package I pay duties at my door, the next delivery man says I can‚Äôt do that and it‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible that I‚Äôve done so before‚Äù then the next delivery man says the second man is wrong and allows me to pay at the door, then the next delivery man leaves a notice and refuses to respond when I ask him why he didn‚Äôt bring the package. It‚Äôs ridiculous, inconsistent and the most unprofessional government section I‚Äôve dealt with time and time again. I‚Äôve had drivers leave half filled out notices, and drive away when I open my door and ask them a question. I‚Äôve had packages that are marked ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù as that‚Äôs the final stages of a delivery, and not arrived for 4 more business days. I‚Äôm slowly discontinuing any business online and it‚Äôs in most part due to Canada Post Services. The chat/help section is practically useless and it‚Äôs disappointing to know this is where my taxes go when I receive better customer service at McDonalds. I agree with all the negative reviews posted and I imagine like myself, they‚Äôre just exhausted of trying to resolve countless issues that‚Äôs why the lack of details and dates in their reviews, and even professionalism in the reviews, because if you can‚Äôt get it from a government worker/post office employee, why give it in a review they‚Äôre clearly not going to take seriously or act upon. But all in all, IF you get the choice, choose UPS, FedEx or any other service available. It‚Äôs worth the extra couple bucks without a doubt."
"I must agree with the comments from fellow customers. Every time I go to pick up a parcel, I am greeted with the most unpleasant and unprofessional people/ customer service agents- regardless of location. I have moved a lot over the years and I can attest that it is universal across most of the country.
Additionally- since when can you state that a parcel has been delivered when i don‚Äôt have it? It is available for pickup- TEMPORARILY- at best.If i see them on strike again...:/"
Let's sum up Canada Post in one word. S H I T
"Packs are late at best and lost at worse. They are refusing to takes responsibilities I had a pack shipped 4 business days ago and the tracking said that they didn‚Äôt receive my pack yet so 4 days after been put in a ¬´ red box ¬ª pack is still not reach a post office yet ....550 bucks lost.....

WORSE company ever, you pay for tracking for express for insurance !!! They loos your pack and take no responsibilities.

AVOID"
"This ""crown corporation"" is the worst. They believe that their ""policies"" over-rule Canadian law! How you ask? Check this out: If you buy any item online that uses CP (Canada Post) as the delivery service, you have ZERO rights as the receiver of the package (even if you paid for the shipping cost!! CP states that only the sender can make a claim against CP, and if successful, the SENDER gets any money, not you the receiver. Still looking for a lawyer with enough guts to challenge these jerks on Constitutional Rights and possession laws in Canada. Oh, and by the way, CP has their own ""in house"" Ombudsman, who loves to tell people they are the final recourse to their issue (no conflict of interest there-much) . I have a better solution, privatize these jerks out of their over-paid, golden pensioned, cushy, do nothing civil servant jobs and end all our MISERY. Canada Post is an embarrassment to our great country."
"Is anyone even reading these posts??
I find it hard to see a review that has even 2 stars!!!!
Yes, I came to this site because Canada Post seems to have lost my package. How can an item in Canada posts hands that has a tracking number go missing?

I called customer service, I used the chat support feature, all for absolutely nothing. I'm told they will get back to me. I have not received an email, no phone call. So why do they even bother asking for this info if they don't use it?

My package was also supposed to be delivered to my FlexDelivery location - because I don't trust the contractors Canada Post employs. I have lost, or should I say, enough items have been stolen.
The other day while I was dressing looking out the window, I saw the Canada post van drop of an item to my neighbors across the street. He left the item on the doorstep and did not even ring the doorbell, then drove away.
Canada Post or our government should do something about this. Besides they don't deliver mail like they used to before email came along."
Canada Post Xpress lost my package after it had arrived at one if their centers and don't know where it is. They can't find it. And they dont even have the decency to contact the sender. I have to contact the sender to tell them ti initiate an investigation. Not happy!!
"i don‚Äôt understand even as a crown corp how you‚Äôre still in business, i‚Äôm in ontario, i placed 2 online orders May 22, 1 from BC, the other from Wisconsin USA, can post expected delivery date of a domestic item is june 3, the one from the US is May 28....UPDATE, my item from the US arrived TODAY! Can Post YOU SUCK!"
"horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, GaHHHhhhhhhhhhhHhh!!!!!!!!"
The Worst .... Lost my package containing stuff for a wedding and would not admit it was lost even though they could not track it using their own tracking number. package never showed up
"If I could rate one out of 10, they would of got it hands down.
Unfortunately in the last two weeks I got two regular mailings returned to me. After the first one I thought I would highlight the postal code for those who have trouble reading....but it didn't help.
The second one returned and I went to the local post office (Rexdale). The girl remembers me coming in and highlighting the postal code and thought well they can't miss this.
So she said lets highlight the whole to address and see if this helps.
I have also had problems with the girl who delivers to our building who has been rude, and less than wanting to work. She told me she was so busy putting letters in the boxes meanwhile I am working in the heat of tax return season...and she wouldn't have clue how to handle that.
Next I will increase font size to 24 pt. and see if this helps the blind coder."
"If I could have given less than one star I would have...absolutely the worst delivery service I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with..never did receive the package..wanted me to drive 220km to pick up parcel they failed to deliver...had I known, Canada Post was involved, I never would have placed the order. Ask who your courier is..if it‚Äôs Canada Post. I strongly recommend you go to any length to avoid their involvement.."
"I would definitely not recommend using this postal service EVER if you can avoid it.

I waited almost three weeks to receive an item after it hadn‚Äôt been shipped. I was notified when the package was out for delivery and told it should arrive that day, but that I should wait two business days before making any formal inquiries about it should I not receive it.

After two business days of not receiving either the package or a ‚Äòdelivery attempted‚Äô ticket, I called the customer service number given. Canada post will try REALLY hard not to talk to you in person, and after opening a support ticket for my package, I was back to waiting again.

Canada post sent me a message assuring me that the package was out for delivery and should be arriving that day .... I checked the tracking on the package and they had already sent it BACK to the sender! When they meant ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù they really meant ‚Äúon the other side of the country.‚Äù

I called customer service to speak to a real person this time, and after finally managing to get someone on the phone, they only confirmed that, yes, the package was on the other side of the country, and that I‚Äôd have to contact the sender about this problem.

Very frustrating and lack of ownership shown by the company!! They didn‚Äôt seem interested in hearing that I‚Äôd followed all their instructions, tickets, and hadn‚Äôt had any access to scheduling another pick up because they hadn‚Äôt even left an attempted delivery ticket."
"Completely unhelpful employee at

Canada post
BOUTIQUE VOILA
M22- 677 STE-CATHERINE OUEST
MONTREAL QC H3B 5K0

Disgusting attitude."
"They claimed that they came to deliver a package that costed hundreds of dollars, but they never showed up and are claiming nobody lives here so they're shipping my package back to the seller with no compensation. We're trying to get it back but they're being very unhelpful. Would never reccomend them. Ever."
"They lost my package and I can't get information about it's making 5 months now...

When you call they cannot do anything even if you have all the proof of your purchase.

The customers services is crap also."
"ex¬∑pe¬∑dite

Learn to pronounce
verb
make (an action or process) happen sooner or be accomplished more quickly.

But in Canada Posts world it means '7 days or whenever we get to it. What are you going to do about it?'"
Horrible experiences. Refused to deliver mail because of a hose connection that caused no danger to anyone. Always deliver packages that need to be signed off during regular work hours. Rude people.
"Worst postal service Ever!!!!!! I'd give a NEGATIVE STAR rating if I could. We've had it happen multiple times where we waited for packages to be delivered to our house. My husband works from home so is basically waiting for our packages. I was atticipating a package on Friday and my tracking number said a notice card was left. Well, no notice card, no one came to our door and now its a long holiday weekend. Looks like I'll get my package on Tuesday. Thanks for your lousy work Canada post!"
"Garbage service. Been trying to get a hold of someone that can provide me the dimensions of an express post label to go on a package and I got nowhere. I spoke to a man in the precision targeter department that was an absolute tool. He spoke over me, didn't listen to my question, cut me off and got mad at me when I wouldn't give him my work address- because it wasn't relevant. Then he hung up. I went in person to speak to a rep and she also could not figure out how to answer my question, her and every rep online via live chat told me to go through customer service, which then leads to a useless 6 step option, followed by many more options, to eventually get nowhere. Garbage service. Thanks for literally NOTHING."
"to be honest, i am not willing to give one star on their service, It should be no star, unrated.
It is a company not trust worthy, not honest. Their staff knows how to fight to get increase of wages but not do their job. I run a small business and have too many bad experience in past 15 years."
"Worst service!!!!!!!!!
I've ordered online and I didn't get my parcel. They just said it was delivered according to their GPS. They didn't even try to help me find it. I was asking who delivered it and who received it. There is no way someone will receive it except me and one colleague. It won't fit in the mailbox too."
"Absolute joke!!! I had a parcel shipped with another carrier from Ireland to Thunder Bay, ON in 3 days yet on the same day I ordered a parcel Barrie, ON and it is going to take over 7 days to cross the province with CP. And this is their expedited shipping!!!! I checked to see if I could pick it up at the facility here as I will there on Friday the 17th but delivery won't be made until the 21st according to the tracking number. I was told that an attempted delivery has to be made first. Their facility is 7 minutes form my office and I have to wait four additional days."
No service at all Ive order something thats been sent with them and its been stuck in the distribution center for a week past due deivery when you call them they give you an extra week to wait for them to find it and the guys over the phone simply have no informations and are being paid to filter and not try to help you‚Äôre basically left without any assurance of when and if you‚Äôre going to receive your package
On two occasions our family attempted to send small packages to my son in Vancouver. Once from the USA and once from New Zealand. In both cases the packages wandered around never reaching him and being returned 4 months later!! Useless
"Was suppose to get my package yesterday and it got rerouted.
Instead of delivering it today, they pushed it to the next business day.
Absolutely ridiculous."
"So, my friend bought some stuff for me from Canada she sent the package through Canada post since April 30. And the package is still in Transit to New Zealand. It‚Äôs an Xpress shipment. And I talked to canada post. All they can say that it‚Äôs still in transit and sorry for the delay. They don‚Äôt even know, which part of the country my shipment isüòëüòëüòë"
"Deserves 0 star, sent express post, status is out for delivery since may 9 its almost 6 days now still out for delivery. I am upset."
"When we pay for a priority delivery and want it delivered the next business day -- WE F**ing MEAN IT. If it is not going to deliver the next day, why the f does it called priority, canada post isnt treating my package like a priority anyway. F*** it. BTW the customer service is simply garbage, they just replied with ""sorry we can do nothing about it"". Then shut down the company and retire! THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ANYWAYS. JUST KEEP YOUR A** AT HOME."
"Few years ago sent a parcel to Romania and it was not delivered. I thought to try it again this year and I get the same result.
Canada Post should take that country out of their list instead of charging us a lot of money for a service that cannot be done."
When you lose a person parcel just admitted that you did instead of coming up with stupid excuses...Do not tell me I received it when I did not..‚òπÔ∏è
We needed to get our roof done and A friend had told us about the finditrateit.ca home improvements directory to search reviews and hire a roofer we so we searched the finditrateit.ca web site known as FiRi.. great place to search with plenty of selections.they set us up with 3 free estimates for verified businesses. I recommended them to my friend also
"Terrible service
I send a package as a gift for my daughter's birthday I paid the xpresspost international service that supposedly had to deliver the package 5 to 7 business day
Package was sent April 30th by today May 11 haven't arrived it is 2 days later for her birthday and because today is saturday she will not receive it during weekends
So why the H offering a service ans making customers to pay a lot of money if is not going to be delivered dueibg the time that you promised to your customers you will"
"Canada Post needs to figure out their tracking system and find efficiencies. Shipping costs are always rising but service keeps getting worse. I recently ordered a product from China. To my amazement, on the 8th day it had cleared Canada customs in Mississauga. 3 days later and it still says ""Processed - Mississauga, ON"".
It's absolutely mind boggling that a package can make it from China, all the way to Canada AND CLEAR CUSTOMS in 8 days, but sits in the Mississauga sorting facility for 3 days. I know its just sitting there and not ""en route"" because I live very close to the facility, so if it were to just leave the facility it would be at my door in a few hours.."
"Was home waiting for my package which required a signature on delivery, which you pay extra for. Was checking the status periodically and see that a delivery attempt was made and the note was on my mailbox. How lazy does one have to be in a good paying job to not ring the buzzer. I went to the pickup location and vented my frustrations and was told ""that's the way it is now"". Well guess what ""privatization is the way now"". Bye bye Canada Post, privatization has my vote."
"Sent a job application with a priority mail service which is supposed to be delivered the next day and as I‚Äôm writing this review right now, my application package hasn‚Äôt been delivered yet to the employer and sadly, the application deadline has passed! It‚Äôs been five days and they haven‚Äôt delivered a national package with in the same province...I mean, talk about some people not doing their jobs right. They just messed up my chances of having the job have been dreaming of for so long."
Took too long to receive my package. Their support associates don't help much too.
Terrible! Just a few months ago ordered something which ended up being delivered to the wrong address not even in the same town?! How does that even happen! Geez eventually the package was found and delivered but still..now waiting for another package that‚Äôs been ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù for 3 days I just don‚Äôt understand
"Canada Post in Quebec is holding 8 of our letter mail shipments back, because they would be 21mm in thickness, instead of 20mm maximum, as they said. They want us to pay additional 120 CAD for those 8 letters, to convert them into parcel items...

Canada Post you are outrageous. We (my business) fight a war against the Chinese sellers, being able to ship what ever they want regardless weight and size for just some Cents, and you want to charge us 120 CAD extra for 8 letters.

Canada Post it the ruin for ecommerce in Canada. But unfortunately, we as a prairie-business, don't have any alternative available.

The reason why we will move the business to Ontario in 2020 is Canada Post. You are the reason for me to sell property, take kids off school, and move to a different province. But of course, you don't give a sh..."
"Ignores request to leave the package at the front door. Then proceeds to leave a delivery notice to pick up the item after 6pm, when they close at 530pm."
"They take forever to deliver packages. The expected date keeps getting pushed back l, and i still have not recieved a package that was supposed to be delivered two weeks ago. I was told it would be sent promptly yesterday morning to make up for it but nope it was not. Shocker. Dont waste your time."
Rude postal workers. They are just a scam for your money. I paid insurance on a parcel that didnt get delivered and when being returned to me it got destroyed. So why did i pay insurance when i received nothing. Plus at the office where i pick up my mail. They are rude c**ts
"My package was in Sudbury, it arrived at 12.23am, but no updates since then, you mean to tell me you can't drive that down an hour and a half and deliver it to me same day? Your just looking for excuses to get shut down. Next strike I'm hoping for big lay offs, you guys really suck at your job and make nothing happen daily."
Canada post is the worst mailing service around use any other services out there they also have the worst customer service ever a hole bunch of stuck up people that hate there job and dont care about helping they really need to be trained again
"It is literally a joke that I shipped international package from CANADA to China, they overcharged everything and they lost it. Great work and never deliver on time."
"Worst customer service ever.

Carriers expend the barest minimum energy required.

Customer ""service"" tactic is to say ""in sorry you feel that way"" with a clear smirk.

If you have documents that must be delivered urgently and securely, give them to the nearest meth-head for more reliability."
"Worst of the worst ! I wont but again from any seller associated with Canada Post. A bunch of Liars, they do not attempt delivery."
"My package has not left its point of origin since april 22nd, its may 2nd today. Customer service informs me if i don't receive by the 8th they'll begin investigating. They either lost my package or one of their employees probably stole it."
"deliveries are never attempted, no delivery slip ever, stop offering delivery and just tell us you're going straight to the post office."
"Ordered a package from the OCS, and it claimed it was going to be delivered yesterday. I waited all day only to have my tracking say ""Verifying recipient's address; Possible delay"". I made sure to check that my address was okay and everything came up fine. So why wasn't my package delivered? Well, guess my courier didn't feel like coming to my door that day, and this was his best, ""legitimate"" excuse. So yeah, when you mail with Canada Post, just hope that your courier is in a good mood and feels like dropping off your package to you. Absolutely disgusting..."
"one of the reasons I regret coming to Vancouver island as an exchange student
Any postal service in Japan is far better than this"
SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM. Do not send through this carrier !!! DO NOT! Horrible customer service!!!!!!! HORRIBLE. Disgusting.
"So my package is finally scanned into my home city facility on Friday morning with a delivery date that continues to get pushed back because of extreme weather (flooding). I needed it for the weekend (which is already days past the guaranteed delivery) so i do the online chat and say i would like to go pick it up myself. Apparently this is not possible.... I am offering to pay them to deliver something that I will go pick up, basically paying them for nothing but that is not allowed. After chatting I spoke with some more people on the phone who were equally as useless. I hate using Canada post because I always know there will be something to mess up my order, which will prompt me to try and resolve it, which leads to me having to try to deal will people who are stupid and don't care about their job or anything in life. Given any other option other then Canada Post I will take it!!!"
"Customer care was absolute garbage. Paid a lot for priority delivery. Package came late but that's not it. Tried to chat with an agent to check the status of delivery (tracking site was not updated). Only received a very short answer 'your package will be delivered today' (but they practically said them same thing the day before). Agent then asked what else he could help. As soon as I tried to ask for more information, he suddenly left the chat without saying anything. Paid tons of money just to make sure the parcel is cared of and they treat you like garbage."
"awful service, garbage customer care, unbelievable incompetence. It is just a few things I can say about this company. It is a month they are trying to fix the issue on my business account. They are unreliable, not responding, not following up not resolving the issue. and I am carrying 4000 postcards at the back of my car for a month. The flyer are soon to expire and yet the issue on the stupid website of Canada Post is not yet resolved. DO NOT USE THEM."
"Because the company i order from regularly have stopped shipping to Canada, I am lucky enough to have them ship to a U.S post box not far from me. I cannot believe the difference in shipping times. What used to take 5 weeks to get to me in Canada ( one time it actually took 3 months!!!), now consistently arrives in 4 business days!! How is Canada Post so bloody slow??? The company stopped shipping to Canada because of so many lost parcels, or parcels taking too long. The woman I was conversing with in the UK said they couldn't afford to ship to Canada anymore. Thank goodness for Royal Mail and USPS....parcels delivered across the pond faster than I can get a parcel delivered from my neighbour using Canada post! If you are close enough to border, use a post box in the states!"
"I paid for PRIORITY(48 hours delivery) on Tuesday 04/16/19 for a package to be sent to Strattford, ON. because the recipient was supposed to travel with it overseas on Sunday. It was only delivered to his address yesterday (Tuesday) after he left the country. Today is Wednesday (More than a week later) and i have not gotten a relevant information on when i will get my package back or even a refund. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!!"
"Waiting for a parcel, Canada post blew their own delivery standard date by 3 business days so far, they couldn't even make it on the day when the status said it was out for delivery. Fingers crossed for today..."
"If I could give no stars i would. Too many human errors paid for Express 1 day shipping and it's been a full week. Horrinle customer service, rude not understanding and very hard to get ahold of."
"Onto pack #9 that apparently was delivered yet we never received it. In fact suspecting a light fingered mail person here. Called in a complaint again, person was rude and short but certainly didn‚Äôt like my accusation despite the facts I told him. Thankful that amazon and Sephora both replace no questions asked but Canada post literally takes no responsibility. Thankfully have had two people drive items of mine that were delivered to them ( not even remotely close in address) as they opened and saw children‚Äôs item so felt we should get them, thankfully kind people! But Canada Post, ridiculous. Even had one box SOAKED delivered to us that had an ordered cell phone!! Unbelievable, not sure where else to turn to complain as they don‚Äôt want to hear it."
"Canada Post should be called Canada Crap Post, as they are the worst! Express Post is not! Delivery drivers are incompetent with illegible writing on their Delivery Notices with misspelled names and worst of all abuse their power by not delivering items on truck when tracking says out on delivery. Also drivers do not even go to door (caught on camera) to knock/ring ..they just leave notices in mailbox with wrong information on card..boxes checked twice so its a guessing game as to when pick up hours..then when i was able to pick up item according to notice..the hours of pick up were wrong and outlet was closed!! another incident was they lost the tracking!"
"Able to write a Delivery notice, incapable of ringing a door bell nor punching a three digit code for an apartment building. They‚Äôll deliver you‚Äôre bills with no problem, if its something you want or ordered be prepared to fight for it"
"Purchased 4 month mail forwarding in Innisfail AB. Month went by I received no mail, went into the post office and they said it was the carriers fault and it was fixed, still received nothing and went back and asked them to fix it again, same story.
I put a request in for a full refund on March 20th and I was given and ‚Äúresolution date‚Äù or March 29th.
After a month of calling them, speaking to supervisors and other workers, they tried to say that ALL of the mail I was expecting didn‚Äôt have my unit number of my previous address on it so it all got sent back. Which would be a pretty big coincidence considering while I lived at my old address I received mail from those senders JUST fine.
They gave me another week and a new resoulution date. I‚Äôm about to say screw what I paid just for the big run around I‚Äôm receiving. If you could opt out of anything with them I would, because they make so many mistakes and do not make up for them what so ever."
"They're still celebrating religious holidays like a bunch of neanderthals, wasting my time."
"My experience with Canada Post is the worst, they lost my passport and my confirmation of permanent residence, now I have to get another passport at the embassy and explain my employer and immigrations this situation and pay thousands of dollars for flights to Ottawa to fix this. The supervisor that I talked to from CP was useless, no responsability from these people, not very bright people working there which i understand"
"In the last year lots of national parcel I order are arriving late, they cannot explain why, it took 8 days to receive my last parcel from Toronto to Montreal , and 7 for one from Markham, another parcel from British Columbia is stuck at Richmond facility for 6
5 days now and still going.... their service is Horrible!! In the past I always got my courrier in 2-3 days, sometime 4. They changed and aren‚Äôt reliable anymore."
"These services sound so great, the idea is fantastic, but Canada Post cannot manage mail and so it becomes a nightmare. Much better to go the old fashion method and ask your neighbour.

I used both the mail re-direct twice and mail hold services once in the last 12 months, both services are poor. Problems: mail re-directed as undelivered and mail held/lost for more then 15 days past the service period. I have been waiting for my mail since April 3rd and its April 17th and no mail. I just heard from a financial Institution that mail re-directed from Sudbury to Ottawa for 3 months was send back to sender as un-deliverable. Luckily, the financial institution contacted me to inquire about a address change. It leaves me to wonder what other mail was lost last fall.

Efforts to resolve with two visits to the local post office and three calls to customer service, each promising in turn that the issue will be resolved. Now, I have receive a promise of delivery by the 24th of April, who knows how this will end."
"Shipping Service - Can someone from CP please explain to me how it takes a parcel 7 days (assuming the parcel actually gets to it's final destination in this time) to go from Oromocto, NB to Montreal, QC, a total distance of 829.2 km or approximately 8 hours driving time."
"CANADA POST most awful company, dosnt care about their costumers. And much more. I highly recommend no one to use them they r so unhelpful too"
"Three times my international parcel was not delivered at home. The delivery person change the status on their internal tracking system WITHOUT physically being present at the delivery location or pushing the buzzer. They just simply put ""notice card"" (which has no time stamp) at some later time. They simply do hub-to-hub delivery. The delivery person was caught red handed, photos has been sent to @canadapost over twitter, filed complaints three times. No action. Highly unionized. Switched all my shipping and mail to other."
I dislike Canada Post - i never like to hear anything i order is being handled or delivered by them . No care for customers - Nor there parcels . Ive had empty envelopes and parcels delivered with missing product - ive had late parcels - and they never know where or when a parcel will be delivered or where it is . Ive used other carriers that can actually contact the exact carrier and find out the eta of your package . I am disappointed in their services and would suggest any other carriers then them . THE WORST EVER !!
"Over the past year I have had several shipments by Express post over the past year sent by using this service. It is mentioned as providing delivery next day or at the most two-day delivery.
Although you oh a premium for this service Canada post has actually never been able to achieve this delivery time.
Shipments with express post usually arrive in the 3-5 day range which is the delivery time for regular mail.
Not sure why the service can‚Äôt be delivered as is mentioned... just shows that they do not care about the device they provide to customers. I have made a call to them before requesting information on this topic but it always falls in deaf man‚Äôs ears from the looks of it.
Canada Post... man up and fix your service... Pronto!"
"Canada Post has figured out that work is hard but much easier if the customer does it for them.
I have lived all over the world Canada Post is easily the worst mail delivery system of the 50 plus countries I have been to or lived in. China is better, the US is far better even supposed 3rd world countries provide much better service.
Because CP is so pathetic UPS, FedEx etc can also provide bad service because there is no competition. As a result mail and package delivery in Canada is hopeless."
The delivery drivers of Canada Crap Post think they have the power to control items/parcels that are supposed to be delivered..they kept parcels in their truck. Also the tracking system they offer is not trustworthy..they dont update for 4 or 5 days after item picked up from sender. Paid Express delivery for nothing..now they lost over 100 dollars worth!!!
"I have a lot of possible choices...but it‚Äôs not VIA, or TTC, or CNR or CPR, it is without a doubt , Canada Post! I don‚Äôt really want to be without a postal service but I suggest with the current state of Canada Post, we are. A package shipped from USA by DHL arrived in my city two days ago, now stuck with the posties, why? Just because. It came from Boston to Mississauga in two days but is stuck with Canada post because they are inept and rather carry junk mail.
They will create a card and have me go too a pick up point, why? Lazy, inept or both. I urge every seller i deal with not to use them. I think they pride themselves on being bad!"
I am an online seller and I ship worldwide. Canada Post is the worst mail service in the entire world. Doesn't scan registered mail packages and constantly loses them. Sorry Canadians I will no longer ship there thanks to your piece of üí© mail service.
I was once home waiting for a large parcel from Korea and the entire day did not hear so much as a knock. My mother comes home and sees a tag for a parcel that was missed when no one even rang the bell. So my mother and I luckily found a canada post truck near and had asked if he had our parcel. After checking our tag he said he rang the bell and no one came down and had returned the parcel to the near post office. We then went to the post office asking for the parcel only to find out it was not there. I later found out our parcel was with that mail man the entire time after talking to a different mail man the same day.
Absolutely the worst postal service worldwide. Have had carriers not even attempt delivery and say pick it up at the post office. No card left. Multiple time. Lazy workers. Canadapost needs to be privatized to offer some competition. I live in a border Town and find a cheaper to cross the border and mail packages to Canada then send it via canadapost. Get you're heads out of your asses
"Horrible Money sucking morons. My postie writes up delivery notices without even buzzing my apartment. I order a lot from eBay and Amazon. Last Friday I missed the mail moron by 5 mins and drove past him as he was delivering to a building just after mine. He knows me, my car and I have never been unfriendly with him in the past but does he wave me over? Hell no. I check my mail box to find one of his annoying notices. I hop into my car to catch up with him..... NOWHERE to be found. It's a Friday, he comes early to f_ckoff early. (All week he shows up at almost 6pm, Friday, he's done by 2pm)
Well It's now Tuesday, the package is not at the post office, never made it and in fact they don't know where the hell it is! But every year or so they strike, cry for more money but get shittier all the time.
If you think at one time, CP was worried email was killing their business when in fact it's their horrible business killing their horrible business!
We need a completely new postal service that wipes them out. Their salary is getting close to that of a doctor or lawyer but work like Larry, Curly and Moe.
I wouldn't pee on a postie if he was on fire!!!"
WHY they DO NOT DELIVER to the door? I payed $17 for EXPRESS delivery. Can not walk as I recently had a surgery. Was whole day near the opened WIDE my entrance door - they managed to sneak pass my house - and left package in the mail room.
"&@$$& @&$&. My tracking shows out for delivery and the second after : its says that I wasn‚Äôt there wich isn‚Äôt true. First of all I don‚Äôt have the paper, second I need to wait 2 days till the package reach a 3rd part store. Y‚Äôaa must have been heavy trafics out there hehe. Worst isn‚Äôt even enought."
"I don't understand how they can be so poor .... when I speak to employees at the post office, they too are frustrated by the inefficiency and unacceptable delays and the completely ineffective responses from customer service supervisors. An essential (and small, light) part for my business arrived in Canada (Mississauga) March22nd, after one day with USPS, 9 days later (March 3st) it got to Burnaby, and today April 7th it is still there. Complaining has no effect..it's almost as though they are proud of their incompetence."
"When I lived in a condo; I constantly had to travel kms to pick up my packages from their inconvenient pickup locations because their delivery person ""missed me"". They do not deliver to my apartment door and do not try to contact me on the intercom so I can come down and receive my package. This meant that the literally only way to not ""miss me"" was if I literally waited in the lobby for the 3-4 hour window they give for the deliveries; if I wanted to pick up my purchases kms away I would not have ordered them online! In contrast, other services, such as UPS, not only contacted me when they arrive for delivery, but they even come up to my apartment directly to deliver the package.

Their delivery times are also extremely slow and their delivery people (from my experience) generally do not care about the packages they are delivering. I once ordered a rare large print from Texas; the delivery person literally damaged the package by forcefully stuffing it into the small mailbox in my building (for MAIL) instead of literally walking 5 meters over and dropping off the package at the lobby front desk. After contacting their customer support, I was given a case number and told that the manager will speak with the delivery person so that it ""does not occur in the future""; they did not even offer to follow-up or to compensate for their incompetence. Absolutely ridiculous.

Only reason they are still in business is because they are a crown corporation."
"Worst company ever. Lost so many packages of mine.

In one case, they confirmed on their website that my client had received package but my client never received. I argued with them for months. Six months later they returned me the package.
They leave delivery slips at door without even ringing doorbell. I guess it‚Äôs easier for the postman to leave a slip than to carry the box to your door."
"We were expecting to receive our parcel Friday night before 8:00 pm. My wife and I were both home and eagerly waiting for the phone that is linked to our buzzer to ring. I decided to check the tracking information around 7:00 pm and much to my dismay (but not surprise), saw an ""attempted delivery"" message at 6:47 pm.

No delivery was attempted. Our buzzer code is clearly listed in the lobby and we know that it works with the phone. This is yet another instance where the person responsible for delivering our package couldn't be bothered to do their job and just left a pickup slip instead. I am so glad that someone has captured this all-too-common behaviour on camera and posted it online...

I have no sympathy whatsoever for Canada Post and will use any other carrier if I have the option. Other carriers actually do their job, and even delivery packages right to our door. I'm not expecting this level of service, but am shocked that Canada Post carriers can't even bothered to buzz. Now we have to take time out of our day to do their job (and not get paid) and travel across town to pick up the parcel ourselves."
"Ordered feb 28th, suppose to arrive the 15th to the 1st, home all say & I go outside today (2nd) and there‚Äôs a note saying I have to pick it up at the post office. I never have problems with usps, ups, fedex but fuuuuck Canada post, if you have a option DONT choose Canada post"
"I wish there were negative stars to give, even 1 bad star is too much for canada post.
Worst customer service ever. We have had many issues with them and they are irresponsible and horrible in responding and solving a problem.
They even lost a very important package related to my citizenship application that was sent via priority mail with tracking and signature and did not a care single bit when I told them they have jeopardized my entire application. I cannot say how bad they are.
How can such a big company be so unprofessional and negligent ? How is that even possible.
Last week I sent a birth certificate to US again priority mail including tracking and signature , and the most stupid thing is that they say we are responsible only till the package is in canada after it leaves canada it is out of our responsibility and if you want to track your package you have to contact US POST ? I mean how stupid is that??? I sent my package with canada post, but I have to follow up myself with US post ???? I wish there was a platform where we could all inform everybody of canada post's incompetency and inform everyone to stop using them. It is very frustrating"
"I don't want to go to the post office for a parcel. If I have to go to the post office, that means I have time to go to the store. CP please don't make fake ""attempt delivery"", I am tired of it."
Orders a package From Booklyn New York USPS got it to the border in 23 hours has been 7 days and haven‚Äôt got it ... I live in Toronto
"Sent a business item internationally - item not delivered within the timeframe that I had been told at shipping centre or clearly marked (not hidden in drop downs) on site . Spoke with rude, sarcastic customer service agent clearly not invested in finding a solution or leaving a happy customer. Will neither recommend nor use their service for anything other than local unimportant mail. Have always had reliable on time service with Fedex and UPS."
"Awful company to do business with.
Over the years these workers are EXTREMELY LAZY PEOPLE.
There is really no way to get ahold of anyone unless you want to sit on hold for over an hour at a 1800 number only to get the wrong department. I was transfered & they hung up on me. Uurrrr.
If you have a say in the way your order is shipped, go with any other company. FED EX is awesome.
I GIVE ZERO Stars here."
"Why can't Canada Post have a phone number for their outlets?
My package was late and so I contacted the seller.
They tracked it with Purolator who had left it with Canada Post.
The tracking number with Canada post said they had tried to deliver it and had left a note. I had stayed home all day to wait for this package and they had not tried or left a note. Why can't I phone Canada Post to locate my package!!!!!"
"Basically, don‚Äôt bother ordering online from any company that uses Canada Post. My package was supposed to arrive on March 21st. Today is March 26th and their update still says ‚Äúin transit‚Äù. In the history it said that the package has been shipped by the sender, and was released by customs and is now with Canada Post. Only for the customer service representative to ask me to call the sender in order for the sender to contact Canada Post. What a joke is this!!! I told her that the sender has no longer anything to do with this, it is with Canada Post!!!. She then says, that‚Äôs the Policy at Canada Post, then I proceeded to say that I have already contacted the sender and they said what I said to her, they have no longer anything to do with this, it was shipped by them and released by customs and is now with Canada Post!!! She then said, okay, I will issue a service ticket to start the investigation. Seriously!!!! I had to fight to tell her to do her job properly so she can act and issue a service ticket?!! She was trying to get the easy way out.... horrible service and incompetent customer service. I am not even sure if Canada Post bothers to read all these negative reviews and actually act upon it or do sething about it. Useless... Lesson learned, no online orders from anyone who uses their service for delivery."
"I send a registered mail on the 27th of February to Grenada which suppose to take 7 days to get there, today is the 26th of march and still the package haven't arrived. It was a waist of money paying to register my mailüò°üò°üò°"
"I would have rated 1 star, but my regular neighbourhood CP driver is wonderful!!
I had only good experiences. However, the abysmal experience and service I'm having right now lies with the last representative whom ""helped"" me try and track an item not updating for several days by phone.
She was impatient, sarcastic, and I could practically *hear* her eyes rolling throughout the phone call. She kept recommending I sign up for email updates, as opposed to checking the app, and would not confirm whether it was more accurate or not. Doesn't one leave the other redundant then? Why even have it? I hung up the phone feeling bullied and furious.
Surprise, surprise. Still no updates, no help, no peace of mind. I'm done."
"An item was sent to me in Alberta from Manitoba on Wednesday by Express Post with a 2 day delivery that should have been delivered to my house Friday. They had some delay in Winnipeg which meant it would not be here until Monday which I could deal with.

Today, (stayed home purposely for this) they did not even come to my house but just dropped a card off in the community mailbox. Now I am being told I can't pick it up until after 1:00 PM tomorrow. I went online as that is where they direct you, the person there could not resolve the issue and directed me to call the 1-800 # and talk to a supervisor. It is going on 60 minutes on hold now to even talk to a supervisor.

It is unfathomable to me that they cannot complete a simple task that is their core business. It isn't like this was some oddball situation and it is also unbelievable that when there is already a service failure of their premium product that it isn't resolved as a priority. If I ran my business like this, I would have gone bankrupt years ago.

It just screams that this organization is being run without any accountability for the performance of anyone.

Like others have said, in the future I will insist on using any carrier but Canada Post (or Purolator, a Canada Post company that is even worse if you can believe that) and if it was possible to rate negative stars I would have done so."
"It's been a number of years since I was able to rely on Canada Post deliveries, but things are going from bad to worse! Over the past two months, I have had my property tax statement delivered to someone else, received my neighbour's credit card statement, had one of my parcels delivered to the wrong address, and not been notified of a parcel waiting at the depot (I'm sure someone got the delivery slip, but it wasn't me). I was only able to get my parcel with help from the merchant, who sent me the Canada Post tracking number.
My neighbours and I might as well put up lawn signs announcing our salaries, property taxes, credit limits, etc. Clearly there is no concern for protecting confidential info that Canada Post is entrusted with. I have now opted for e-billing for as many services as I can, and hope that Canada Post goes out of business entirely. It's not as though they are an inexpensive option."
"Up until a delivery received today, CANADA POST has never failed me, but a birthday package sent by my sister, FIRST CLASS and EXPRESS POST, clearly marked FRAGILE on two sides, has CLEARLY been DAMAGED on those SAME two sides.

This gives it a blatantly defiant, disrespectful appearance to the message borne and adherence to the request to HANDLE WITH CARE.

I just hope that the present sent with love has survived the crushing."
"I had to pry my Amazon Prime Canada Post Flex Delivery package from the post office outlet I chose for shipping it to. That is because my package was transferred to the back room without being recorded in the system and sat there for several days with a note on it that instructed for it to NOT be input in the system. Because of that, it showed as perpetually in transit from Ajax to Whitby in the Canada Post tracking app, and I never got a notification it is already at their location so I can pick it up. I went there to try to get my package, because it could not possibly be for so many days in transit. They denied they have it, pretended it was still in transit (!!!) or even maybe at some other location. In the end they finally produced it with the above suspicious note on it. I have the note.
The mandatory procedure is / should be to record all packages before transferring them in the back room, but they decided against it in my case. Maybe because if was coming form Amazon Prime and it was slim and trim. If a package gets ""lost"", Amazon will replace it. So post outlet will end up with my original package, I would end up with a replacement and Amazon loses because they want to keep their customers happy - and the postal employees unfortunately know that.
If a parcel sits unrecorded in a room with a note on top to certify that is not in the system, anybody having access to it can snatch it without any consequences. It is like it never arrived at their location, so misappropriating it is easy. It is a very troubling behaviour regarding package safety, which makes me never trust Canada Post with a flex delivery pickup again. Beware of safeguarding your purchased goods. Use other carriers instead, they might have proper, responsible procedures."
"What horrible service !!! Packages that do not arrive on time, I video taped our letter carrier grab about 6 or 7 small packages from the grey pick-up box, Go to her car and fill out attempt to deliver cards then go return the small packages from the car back to the grey mailbox. When she showed up at my building(I was waiting for her in the foyer) I asked her where my package was, she replied that my package is at the nearest post location and will be available for pick-up the next day. I didn't want to berate her, but I told her that was a lie !! I asked her if she wanted to see the video i made of her receiving the packages from the grey box then returning them, She got really angry and told me if I didn't like the way she was doing her job to use flucking Purolator !!! I was rather disgusted with the way she wasn't doing her job.I paid for delivery to my door, not for me to have to go to a postal outlet to receive my package! These postal workers seem to think they are above any type of standards. I also work for a living and treat my job with the utmost care and put pride into my job for personal satisfaction, Not just for the customers we serve our products to. I only earn minimum wage(14.55), I only wish i could have their job (45,000/year and up). At least I would put a full effort into serving my customers,Unlike being told to use FlUCKING Purolator!!!!"
"Xpresspost next business day Vancouver to Nanaimo HA
They shipped it to Mississauga and still out there 6 days later.
Refund means nothing, it's the ability to deliver ontime that counts!!
No one bothered to read the shipping label that said BC!!!"
Why have tracking on packages and delivery dates when you don't live up to them? This is a fuckinnnn joke. Been having problems for months
"So my package was sent out on April 14th and it was already in Vancouver on April 15th. The package was suppose to arrive on April 18th but instead of it being sent out to my house it was sent back to its original place, which was in Ontario. And one of my mail should have been only a couple days but it‚Äôs already been three months and it hasn‚Äôt arrive yet. If they could be more sucky than this. Don‚Äôt ever use Canada post they will never deliver your mail. They shouldn‚Äôt even be a company at all. I‚Äôm telling everyone right now. DO NOT EVEN TRUST them with important things. It‚Äôs not gonna help you get your package to the right place at the right time. TRUST is out of the door with them. That‚Äôs my mistake"
"they claimed there was an error.
did not get package that day, must now wait the weekend.
they did not bother to call to fix problem.
do not know if i will get my package."
"Damaged parcel that was insured! Insurance is a waste of time and money!
Is there a lower than one star rating? I would fire their so called ‚Äúinsurance claims agent‚Äù as they are completely USELESS. After sending a parcel that I bought their insurance for to go to the USA, well packed it with a ton of bubble wrap, the goods were shipped grossly damaged. Sent photos and receiver responded with all necessary info and still refused to pay out the measly $160 claim value. Instead, I had the ‚Äúclaims agent‚Äù quote me CPC policies verbatim and then demand to inspect the parcel in its original packaging after the customer opened it and 3 weeks ago! Pompous...get on plane and fill your boots, its in California. Government employee who is not getting it as to who pays their wages. Anybody with two eyes could clearly see the broken shipment. Do your job! What an embarrassment of an organization. Why did I buy the offered insurance again? Oh yeah, to further fund the incompetence of these morons. Hope CPC reviews these....serious issues to correct."
"Yet to have a great experience with Canada Post. I've to pick up most of my parcels that I get from a Canada Post location rather than actually receiving it at home. Sometimes, the driver buzz and ask us to come down the building to them rather than actually coming to our apartment. Other times, they don't even bother buzzing. They just leave the notice in the mailbox. Other postal services that I dealt with such as UPS and Fedex, actually comes to the house and deliver it rather than just being lazy and making the customer come to them."
"Super unhappy with Canada post today.Canada post made a mistake and it cost me money and 6 more days of delivery time. Their delivery man today was unreliable. I had a tracked package coming from Toronto to Ottawa and the package that took 3 days to get to Ottawa was ""returned and is enroute to the Sender"". When I called Canada post, to ask"" why they sent the package back"" they said ""there was no suit number attached to the address"". But the suit number was there and the delivery man did not see it. Now , I have to wait 6 days! and pay to have it resent! all because their delivery man didn't see the suit number. They could of just left it at the post office in Ottawa and I would of have been happy to pick it up there. Next time use fedex!! for your business needs."
"Ok package seems to have gotten lost three times now. Sent from UK disappeared for a month and a day, finally got to ontario canada then went off the radar for another 8 days ( normally takes 3 max ) Then ""out for delivery"" waited all day and NOTHING. It was never this bad, but WOW only thing I could remotely compare this to is DHL. Sad but true!"
Brampton mail service havent received mail in 5 weeks complained 3 times finally i get mail dated back first week of feb bills now over dued and i call and ask were my mail has been for 5 weeks ths postal rude woman says i should call my bills and resend them no clue were my mails been wha t service is this unprofessional people i dont want these to happen again
"If there were less than one star , I would give it to Canada Post. I always have an issue with them. Today, my package is sening back to me. A few months ago, my package stayed more than a month and they didn‚Äôt deliver it until I called them. When I called them and I wanted them to explain why that happened. They send the package for less than 20 minutes. I will never ever use thier service from today on."
"If I could give Canada post negative stars, I definitely would. This company is a joke and the employees working for them are the laziest people on the planet. Multiple times I have received a notice saying I must wait until the next day to pick up my parcel from the post office when it could have easily fit in my mailbox and been delivered the day it was supposed to arrive, not a day later. The employees don‚Äôt even try to attempt to deliver the packages. They can go on strike all they want for better wages but when you can‚Äôt even do your job, don‚Äôt expect a better wage. You get what you deserve. Useless. I wish there was an alternative company to ship parcels from in Canada but I always seem to get stuck with the incompetence at Canada post."
"I missed my delivery yesterday and got a notice to pick up at a far away Canada Post location location. I was bummed. What a surprise today! I got my parcel delivered, the postman knocked on the door, handed the parcel with a smile. I had no idea they would reattempt the delivery. So happy!"
"Driver didn't even try to deliver!

Had a large package delivery from Toronto-Vancouver, should be easy right? NO!

Says estimated delivery was yesterday but somehow got schedule delivery today, Okay sure.
I took time off work to get the package. At noon, checked status, says driver already here and left a card 20mins ago? Hello? I am home and nobody cared to called me or buzz me.
What really shows their customer service is when I checked for the ""card"" they left to show where I have to pick up my package (that I paid delivery for) there was no card. I guess I have to spend another 30 mins looking for the package when it is you paid job to deliver it.

The driver didn't even care to leave a card. Online support is cookie cutter copy and paste answers ( drivers don't have to delivery past 2 floors) who set these rules? are we in 1600 where building only have 2 floors? Also tried to use their phone support, what a mess, I probably can walk to Toronto by the time I past all the automatic voice selections and wait times.

Please improve your service before even attempt going on strike again.
Also maybe give your driver phones? Wait, I guess you going to replace them with soulless robots anyway. You are in a service industry, people has feelings and other things to do other than waiting for you to deliver things.

Hindsight, should have used USPS, UPS instead. I never had this big of an issue with them"
"I WOULD GIVE -1000 STARS TO THIS BUNCH OF THIEF'S. I WANTED TO GET A VISA FROM ONE OF EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND I SEND MY PASSPORT THROUGH THESE STUPIDS . CANADA POST EMPLOYEE DID A MISTAKE AND MY MAIL WAS RETURNED AFTER 7 DAYS AND I ALREADY PURCHASED MY TICKET ALREADY. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY PUT ALL BLAME ON ME AND SAID WHY YOU BOUGHT YOUR TICKET SOON, HOW ABOUT YOU OWN DAMN BUSINESS AND DO YOUR JOB AND TRAIN YOU EMPLOYEES."
"Disgusting utterly disgusting. These people are like a bunch of whining toddlers, they went in strike to have conditions improve for them... Well I'm sorry but you gotta do the F***ing job to reap the benefits....

I have gone through 6 mail delivery personally in 4 years either due to theft, or just not doing their job, there was a period of over 6 months I didn't receive any mail.

More recently I had an item to be delivered,which was input into the system as out for delivery, 2 min later the status was changed to rescheduled to next business day due to weather. It was plus 2 and sunny...all I was told is that the item was probably on the truck still and I'll have to wait an extra day (and waste MY fuel that I PAY for).
Biggest issue is that no one tries to fix it..."
My parcel got damaged and it took them 3 weeks to figure it out. Their customer service is a joke. I have contacted them 5x regarding this parcel and have been given different information or directions every single time.
Sent by Express to Thunder Bay very Important paper work and the Postman was to lazy to deliver to the office that I sent to. They claim they sent a Notice Card but when I called the office they informed me they did not receive and no attempt was made to deliver the Envelope. This has caused a lot of problems for me and now I have to wait till they send that back to me. Will never again use Canada Post when they act like Children. They should be a shamed as they don't care about customers.
Canada post appears to believe that they are more important than their customers and don't seem to care at all about the quality of service.
"Complete CRAP service...Letters go undelivered..Parcels are stolen...
No wonder people use other means to get delivery."
EXPRESS PACKAGE SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED 4 DAYS AGO STILL NOT HERE. YOU GUYS ARE KILLING BUSINESSES. FK CANADA POST
"Customer service tried their best to help us but their delivering service is just sh√ót. Paying for expedited delivery will probably not make a difference at all. On top of that, status says delivered even when it is not. Please get your shxt together. You don't even have 1 star ratings."
"over one month, my package is still not delivered"
Awful company. Make no effort dropping off packages. Famous for Ding-dong-ditch or just leaving a pickup tag and no-knock. awful customer support making a service ticket is intentionally difficult. Tracking is inaccurate on some packages. Doesn't have a phone number where you can simply call and ask a person for help. ( Probably Because their phones would explode with people that always need help with this terrible company.)
Shipment goes straight to Rexal or shoppers drug mart. They never actually attempt to deliver your parcel. Lazy lazy lazy.
Ordered a package from amazon which was shipped promptly just to sit in a mailbox down the street for a month because Canada post can‚Äôt give me a key that fits in a parcel slot. Been on the phone 5 times with them in the last month trying to get a $5 tissue holder out of my mailbox. Not even worth the time I‚Äôm spending trying to get it. So fed up.
If you can use ups fed ex or puralator Canada post is an out dated joke that can't seem to deliver anything on time had a package 15 mins from where I live and It took them a day they got it from missasaga to Barrie then from there it took them 3 days in transit and 3 days after the expected deliver date to finally get my package
"OMG Canada Post strikes again in the battle of the cat litter. Once again I am expected to, after paying for shipping go to the post office and get it home in a cab because it is much too heavy for me to take on the bus. It is heavy but it is within the 50 lbs that carriers are supposed to be able to lift. I was home all morning when he came. He knocked softly and then just took off leaving the pick up card in my mailbox. Didn't even wait for me to answer the door.

Remember a couple of years ago when we all rallied behind the letter carriers to save their jobs when Canada Post wanted to eliminate door delivery? Nice!

And they haven't delivered my tax documents yet either which were mailed out last week and due today. GRRRR!!"
Absolute garbage run business. These workers do not deserve the money they earn. Horrible costomer service. Next time they go on strike. Do not support them. They refused to release my heart medication to me because i had it addressed to my mothers house. The package was in my name. Please shut this organization down
I am home every day and every time a package is out for delivery I listen for the door...when I check my front porch at the end of the day there is always a delivery attempt slip on my door. This has happened at least a dozen times now. They don't knock or ring the doorbell so how do they know if I'm home or not? This leads to wasting at least a half hour of my time to drive to the post office and wait in line and then drive home. Not to mention you can never go get your package until the next day after 1pm. What am I paying for??? I guess I will start working outside on my front porch when a package is out for delivery from now on. I bet they don't even have the package in hand when they put the slip on the door. Totally unacceptable.
"I blame canadians‚Äô political views for Canada Post‚Äôs very existence. I cannot think of a private company that would offer no customer service nor feedback without fear of going bankrupt.
This is to be expected of Canada post. Nothing is to be done when you make numerous complaints (goodluck finding a platform on their website to write a complaint) about a mailman not delivering packages to your door, leaving a notice without bothering to knock, and so on."
"Canada Post hired an outright thief as mail carrier about 15 months ago at my address. Despite numerous calls to complain by myself and several neighbors, nothing done to remedy the situation by Canada Post management.

To alleviate the problem, went to paperless where I could. However, several important pieces of mail not delivered including one important letter that has caused me and my family a lot of grief.

Canada Post is nothing but a complete waste of taxpayer money. They can't even get their employees to do what a trained monkey could do."
"Less than 1/4an inch of snow and we got a notice... he could safely walk to our mailbox to give us the notice tho.
.. newsflash we are In Canada flu season... our sidewalks are in no way unsafe. 3 doors down a house stands with 3 to 4 inches of snow on the city walk and nothing has been done.... get over it Canada post ... less than a 1/4 inch of snow ....not even ice... isn't gonna hurt...and if it does then get a new job."
Its not even worth it for me to write anything but the worst service ever. They keep sending my packages to the wrong post office. And on and on....
Twice in a week's time the postal worker pulled into my driveway and didn't leave a delivery notice OR even get out of the car. I was literally standing at the window watching it happen. By time I got outside the Canada Post worker had pulled out and left. WHAT THE HECK?
"Waited all day for a parcel, didn't leave the house once. Item now says redirected to recipients new address.....I've lived here for 20 years!!!!! PRIVATIZE THE POST NOW. These humps can't even manage to find an address and they don't care."
"Probably the worst mail carrier out there. Will never get your items on time. Complaints are not effective. This is NOT a delivery service, this is a pick up service. they will not attempt to delivery your items, only deliver a delivery slip on where to find your items."
"I can not believe the replacement postman (my postman is on vacation) is so incompetent and the man I spoke to 905-732-1062 ex 2003 is not any better. I paid to have quick shipping from a company that has never required a signature because I needed the package tonight for a wedding. The parcel had my unit number, buzzer number AND cell phone number. I have been waiting and tracking all morning just to have her leave me a slip to pick up the parcel TOMORROW. Tomorrow doesn't work! The customer service worker over the phone took my info and said he will call and let her know her error and that I'm basically Out Of Luck because even though she's 5 minutes away it's already on its way to the nearest drop off and I still have to wait until 1300 hours tomorrow to pick it up. Unacceptable Welland Ontario Canada Post!!"
"Rude employee at the post office, shoppers Drug Mart 1309 Carling Ave in Ottawa.. The lady is impolite and ask the clients to leave for no reasons..."
I post all over the world and Canada post is probably the worst national postal service globally.Awful.
"Today I got home from work and it had snowed in between the time I left and when I returned home. It had snowed an inch maybe two, and the post-person left a note on one of my envelopes to clear the walk way. This is not the first time that this has happened, and it has also not stopped snowing so it doesn't make sense. Another thing is the walk way two houses has not been cleared all winter. There is absolutely no need for the comment on my mail, it would be one things if there was over a foot of snow and it hadn't been shovelled in weeks."
"Once again! Canada Post continues to fail at providing their ""service"".
Between the late & lost packages I have had to deal with through the years. I am at my wits end!! I can't handle the incompetence, the excuses and the fact the no one is held responsible for their malfeasance.
What did they go on strike for... to get paid more $ to do a worse job?"
UNBELIEVABLE poor customer service !! The agent working at the post office whilst reading my parcel entered the wrong destination code so the Christmas gift that took us 4 hours to assemble ( a family scrapbook album ) was sent to the wrong country. I called CP and was told they are sorry for the inconvience but nothing they can do. I should have read the 2.5 foot long receipt of multiple parcels I was sending at the same time. NICE !! Real NIce and great customer service folks !!
"Terrible as usual. Once more I'm home all day and have a package coming. Again, no one knocks and just sticks the pick-up slip in the mailbox. If it's raining or snowing, no mail service for days and suddenly a ton of it when the sun is out, so I get a bunch of late bills. I can't wait until Amazon and Intelcom bankrupt Canada Post."
Canada post employee are thieves. And instead they open a serious investigation they simply say that the item was lost and we apology for the inconvenience. Should never send valuable items with Canada post.
"Second time international shipment came late.

Take 2 days from Korea to Canada and takes 8 days to ship it locally and still in TRANSIT!

Shows how bunch of this moronic union workers work effectively in this country.

I live in Calgary and my shipment just got scanned in Regina.

Typical story of Canada post. Cheers!"
"Its happened a few times now , when I go to Canada post and there is a sign on the countertop saying that they will be back in 10, or 15, I'm sorry but that is just wrong. If I go to a store, pick up something to purchase, go to the counter to pay, and someone says, sorry sir you will have to wait 15 minutes. That's what I had to do, go back to my truck and wait 15 minutes.
I have had so much trouble with Canada post over the years its sick. Undelivered parcels, leaving parcels on the front porch, only to be stolen, that's against their policy, but they still do it. I personally lost 800 dollars worth of parcels 2 years ago, with no help from them whatsoever. It's funny
....I was reading a comment saying not to pay too much attention to the one star feedback, here's what I have to say to that, family members, workers, or friends should NOT be able to comment, and he was right about not paying too much attention to the one star feedback, because in Many cases it should be ZERO.
If Canada post had any competition, there would be no Canada post. They whine about weight of parcels, hours, benefits, wages......they are among the most incompetent group of workers I know."
I made a mistake of sending a parcel with Christmas gifts without a tracking number. The parcel was sent few days before the strike. It's four months since then and the parcel is lost. Canada Post is not responsible for anything and not even returning my money I paid for the service they didn't provide. Canada post shouldn't offer a service they are not responsible for. I feel like they stole my money and maybe even the parcel. It's very frustrating!
"So you‚Äôre scrolling through the reviews and see a bunch of 1 stars? Let me tell you this ‚Äî most if not all of the people that actually review on Trustpilot have something to complain about. Canada Post provides an excellent postal service and I personally have had no issues. If you don't believe me, search up Trustpilot reviews for Purolator or UPS for example, and you‚Äôll see that their reviews are as bad if not worse. Don‚Äôt always look at customer reviews to make your decision as there are few people who had a good experience that will review on sites like these. Not saying that the problems that those that rated 1 star are invalid, but they‚Äôre not as likely to happen as often as these reviews make it seem."
"If I could give these people a negative rating I would. I received a text message from Canada Post that my package that I have been waiting for close to a month now said that the package was out for delivery and that the window for delivery was going to be from 9am to 8pm. So I waited for the delivery (mind you it's family day today in Ontario). I patiently waited and during this time I saw 4 Canada Post trucks drive by my home. I decided to call a Canada Post representative around 3pm, they said that the window was until 8pm and that my package will be delivered by 8pm gauranteed. I was okay with that. Since I have been waiting all day already what's a few more hours. I then got a text message from Canada Post around 5:57pm saying my package is being held for pickup. So I called customer service and they said my package will be delivered tomorrow. I was so upset cause I'm lost my entire day because they couldn't deliver my package. Mind you it was still 2 hours away from the cut off time. I told them if they can leave the package at my nearest post office. They said they will deliver it, I said I will not be available tomorrow and they said if your not there, they'll send it to my post office. They provide terrible customer service. Thus is terrible, I've never had a problem with any other company like Purolator or ups. Only Canada Post. This company is such bull crap and should be ashamed of themselves oviding such terrible service. They should take the name Canada off their f-ing name, they don't deserve to use it. F U Canada Post"
"Last week, I dropped off flyers for our small business, Chris Bigham Drywall, at 2110 Kipling Ave in Toronto. What a difference from years ago when things were not as nice!! But Rob greeted me with a warm smile and handshake took my box to stamp and initial. He could not have been more accommodating!
I know they did a great job because a couple days later the phone started to ring. 5 stars!
Regards,
Christopher Bigham"
"The past two years all the mail containing Christmas cards have been sliced open when they arrive in our mailbox. Also recently ordered books from chapters. Someone opened the box, took out the books and put it through to be delivered. Thankfully Chapters sent me replacement books and the agent didn't sound overly surprised this happened. Get your act together Canada Post. Your mail service is a joke and embarrassment"
"Horrible company. Like honestly. You ""attempt to deliver"" my package. Only i buzzed you people up and you DO NOT DELIEVER THE PACKAGE. You leave a ""delivery slip"" for me to go pick it up....2 days AFTER the ""attempted delivery"".... Total B.S. And now because of the shoppers it goes to is closed on weekends i can't even get it until Monday(though it was checked off to go Saturday after 1pm...). So an additional 4 days to reiceve the package that should have been PROPERLY delivered in the 14th.

Thanks Canada Post. Youre the best!- said no one ever."
"They would rather send my package back to BC from Ontario, then simply give me a call to confirm my address. I've had issues such as this and worse happen to me several times. I had to come write a review. Honestly, the most inefficient, lazy, and disorganized postal service I've had the displeasure of using. They might as well still be affiliated with the government. How a private organization still operates like this is beyond me."
"Canada post is the worst to deal with.. I ordered my iPhone with xpresspost and they said it would be here the next day.. 2 weeks later!!!! and still NOTHING!! and when I call they tell me they don't know where my package is ""its lost"" like what the HELL?!?!? I will NEVER use them again!! thanks Canada post! you should be ashamed of your self

I will stick with UPS for now on. lesson learned!"
"Update on first review!!!!!!!! I had a parcel delivered today ..
I have to say I'm absolutely impressed with Canada Post and its service.
First I have to say any Post worker I spoke with was happy to answer all my questions with a smile.
And I met my local mail Lady and she was wonderful ..
She delivers on 83 ave nw , Edmonton ..
If your lucky enough to be living on this street you will have a fantastic delivery lady.
She made sure to deliver my parcel right to my door and made sure I got it ..
Made my day !!!
As well the email notification as it was in route was a fantastic feature ..
I am very proud to say we have the best postal service in the world.. !.

One month later they dropped the ball big time ..!!! My next parcel has been sitting in Calgary for 2 days and has not moved during a full business day.. It just had to make it to Edmonton .. It in no way takes a week to deliver from Calgary to Edmonton ..
Then not even able to track my parcel .. !!! Is a 3.5 hour drive .. Absolutely absurd!!!
Ordered Monday , put in mail Tuesday, received hopeful the following Monday if I'm lucky.
If I can I'll be using ups or dhl or fed x next time as it is medical equipment."
"Bad service. Parcel is already late for a month, but not follow up action has been done after I called in and created the service ticket. When I first called in after 2 weeks late for the delivery, the customer service told me to create a service ticket as the receiver and have me wait for a week. And after waiting for a week, I did not receive any email, so I call in again. This time, the customer service told me that i need to ask the sender to email customer service And wait for another week............

Service is terrible, and I don‚Äôt even know when am I gonna get my package back. Glad it is not a gift....."
"Worst mail service. Never on time. When you finally get through the automated system and get a so called customer service representative, you still have to wait for a supervisor. When you finally get a supervisor they call the local sorting facility, which doesn't have anyone to designated to answer the phone. So the supervisor sends an e-mail. Problem solved in the eyes of Canada Post. Still don't get the parcel for at least 24 to 48hrs. Even though it was already late when I called. Canada Post just says sorry for the inconvenience. We have done everything we can do.
This is unacceptable. Canada Post pays customer service people who have absolutely no way of solving any problems. They only get the tracking info. And don't have anyone to contact to get the parcel delivered. What is the point of Canada Post Customer Service? Put them to work delivering late parcels."
"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!. Going forward If a supplier uses Canada Post/Purolator to deliver, I will cancel my order. Hope more Canadians do same."
"If any privately owned business operated like this, they would go out of business very quickly. I'm sorry but no communication or updates on parcels being sent across the country for days and weeks, and beyond expected delivery dates, is not acceptable. Expected delivery dates being missed are treated as completely acceptable and no attempt is made from a customer service perspective to even just notify people of what's happening or where things are at. It's simply a 'you'll get it when you get it' mentality. It literally says on the tracking page, we make no guarantees that you'll get your package before, on or after the date we put here. I get that there can be things that happen that are out of their control but come on. Like in what world is this an ok business practice, cause I want to set up shop there. Customer service is an after-thought and almost non-existent. In today's customer-first world, this is nowhere close to being up to par. I will gladly pay more to use a company that cares about my mail/packages and me as a customer. Don't get me wrong, the other options are not perfect, but they get that they have actual paying customers.

While I'm at it, I have to see it's pretty pathetic that cities get a whisp of snow and the notifications of 'no delivery' show up. Like come on, put some good boots on and do your job. You signed up to deliver mail in Canada, it's no surprise. It's snow for christ sake! Why are UPS and Purolator able to make it through this and get their pieces delivered when it snows? because they take their job seriously and understand that they are providing a service that customers are paying for - simple as that. I can only imagine what internal meetings with carriers look like when this topic comes up. Let the pity party begin."
"Horrible online service, never on time"
"I have my new phone being delivered. Considering I need that phone for work I say I have been more then patient.

I also live in an apartment building and often canada post doesnt even try to deliver up to the apartment they just put a delivery notice, so generally I wait downstairs for them because it's not like I have anything better to do.

Today I set up camp waiting for my phone...I watched the canada post delivery come up to the door and stick the notice and walk away, HE DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT IN MY MAILBOX JUST ON THE DOOR!!!! In my slippers I chased him out the door screaming as he drove away.

Now once again...I have to wait another damn day!

I hate canada post....hate hate hate them. I avoid them at a cost if possible but somethings you cannot avoid."
"I'm very happy about the big change this year! Every single parcel came on time this year, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT?!
Just one came broken, but it was shipped from the USA via ebay global shipping program, which slows down everything and the packing was bad too.

However, it's fair to give 5 stars, as I gave only 1 Star in the past for the bad service. This year has changed something...

Thank you Canada Post!"
"My package never came and when I checked the tracker it said returning to sender, when I called I was told no information given to why. So I wasted a day waiting for my delivery that never came."
"The worst ever! My parcel was supposed to arrive on 7th. I called Canada Post when it didn't. The Representative told me it would be delivered on 8th because it arrives at the local post office late. When it did not arrive on 8th like the representative said, I contacted Canada post again on 9th. Unsurprisingly, the representative could not tell me where my parcel was. He did create a ticket for me. Then I received an email on 11th, saying my parcel's at local post office, no other explanation on why it's not delivered. Finally, I received an email update on 12th, saying out for delivery; however, it did not arrive again. I received an email notification for pick up instead. Canada post did not even attempt to deliver the parcel. It looks like Canada post does not have a service standard. If your mail arrives on time, you are lucky; if not, deal with it.."
"Never send anything via CanPost! I paid 93 dollars for tracked, international shipping to arrive in Australia within 5 business days. Three weeks later and I am still awaiting the parcel to be sent. Total BS. Chose a private company."
Pathetic..tracked my amazon parcel from winnipeg to dryden to thunder bay once in thunder bay it went missing...scanned into thunder bay and never seen again..i was told only the sender can initiate a search...?? amazon says have to wait until the 21st of feb..i guess meanwhile johnny the floor sweeper or the driver at the sorting depot is enjoying my item. Nobody wants to do their job or even call the sorting depot....why do they all think they are above helping us...in their minds its only one package i guess....so dont bother yourself in trying to help your customers i guess
"This such a joke of a crown corporation. If this was an actual business, no one would use it. Biggest winers, want more pay but do less. What a joke!"
"Tracked a package online and was at home waiting for the delivery person to attempt a delivery. No attempt was made. Didn't even leave an 'attempted delivery notice.' Package now has to be picked up from the post office.

This isn't the first time this had happened, nor is it an isolated event. This happens all over Canada, all the time. CP, get your employees in line and have them do their job. Then maybe you'll get sympathy and support for going on strike.

Over a thousand reviews and the rating is 1 star. Embarrassing."
"My package was late for about 5 days. I called them to know what us going on because I have to travel the next day. The agent on the phone told me it should have been delivered, because the tracking information says it is out for delivery. She told me to wait, I waited the wholde day, finally the tracking said, the package is rescheduled for the next business day. Why?? I dont know whether she hung on me, the phone cut off. I have to call again and wait on the line he without getting anyhelp. Imagine I have to travel that next day and it is a passport. I waited one day and called them back to ask what is going on. A lady on the phone transferred me to specialist promising me thebl specialist would help me better, and the specialist was rude and didnt even apologize for their careless customer service. She shamelessly told me to go to pick it up at distribution facilities. She shouldn't have been in that position. I paid for expedited package delivery, yet I had to go pick it up myself. If so why do CP pay for the drivers? I dont know why they didnt want to deliver to my house, i didnt know why they kept my passport for those days, i dont know why they rescheduled the delivery while I am begging them I have to travel the next day; I dont know why they did not even deliver it that next day. The saddest part is the facillty they told me to go to pick it up was a walking distance. This is second time I am having bad experiences at Canada Post. First they lost my international package which I had to pay much amount of money and after 6 month of begging them they refunded only the delivery fee. I have lost whole my package."
"I‚Äôve had some good and bad experiences with Canada Post. I would say they‚Äôre about average. Some packages I‚Äôve had delivered have come with no problem. Sometimes they don‚Äôt try to deliver and send it somewhere to be picked up, and there was this one time I‚Äôll never forget. The delivery person actually opened my front door (it was unlocked when my brother went to take the garbage out just minutes before) and threw my package in my house and left. Overall they‚Äôre not bad, just not great."
"They lost 2 tracked packages this month. Says they were delivered seconds after arriving at a sorting facility. Because I‚Äôm the receiver (the person who paid for the items and the postage) they will not talk to me about it, they will only help the sender in China who doesn‚Äôt care because it says delivered he wipes his hands clean of it. Canada post know this is most of the time the case which is why they have this asinine rule."
Not delivered mail for 2months. I clean the snow. Still not show up. Hope the best for canada post. RIP
"Canada Post lost my registered mail (signature required) in 2013. The tracking system showed it was in transit and then nothing happened after that. As a foreigner and new customer of Canada Post, that was the first time in my life I learned that even registered mails could end up in the thin air.

Then in 2017 Canada Post lost the mailbox keys of my new home. The online system shows the keys are already with the local PO, but the local PO never received them.

Seriously, this Crown company should be dissolved. If not it will collapse anyways, because:

1. The Internet is killing paper mails.
2. Private couriers are doing a better delivery job, at least they don't strike.
3. Private couriers will do an even better job with new technologies like drones/self-driving trucks, which are programmed not to toss parcels or simply slap ""undelivered notice"" on door handle.

When that day comes, don't bail out this giant baby."
"Was waiting at my front door for a package to arrive since it was ""on the way"" to my house. And they never showed up. It said delivery attempted but i never seen a driver... i refreshed the page and it said i had to go pick it up.. F U canada post and their employees. They arent doing their jobs yet every package i order is never ontime. Since then i only use UPS or Fedex since both of their customer service is amazing & there always on time if not a day early. Canada post is ridiculous and should be shut down due to lack of work being done. And they should fire all thier employees & get new employees."
"Nothing is ever on time, and customer service sucks"
Can't even deliver a package to the parcel locker and instead tapes a delivery notice to it. the parcel will fit in the locker.
I feel embarrassed for Canada Post and will no longer ship with them if given an option. They basically stole from me twice in 2018.
"These fkin rtards cant get their heads outta their asses long enough to fix thie piece of shiiit company. They leave my 250$ Pc Case on my front step of my apartment front door on a MAIN and VERY busy road. So for my next package from amazon that is being delivered by these jackases, I try and prevent this bushit from happening. I go on their site, I enter my tracking # and I request that if we are not home, bring to Canada Post Office for pickup. We get home from work, see the slip in our front door. (What a relief, a 250$ air purifier isnt sitting on our front steps) So we go to the post office and the brain dead monkeys say that the parcels get brought to a different main location where they are sorted then to come back tonight after 7 or tmmrw after 1..... THIS WHOLE COMPANY IS FUKED. If you ever have the option, NEVER CHOOSE THESE DEGENERATES!"
the worst customer service in the entire world. the worlds worst service as well. these glorified employees get pension and benefits and an outrageous wage meanwhile half the country doesn't receive their mail. i have in the past week had three packages lost and not delivered. for 7 straight days i have not received any mail at all.
"Absolute garbage company that accurately represents the country its named after. Makes empty promises, vague tracking information and a lack of attention to customer service. The one star given to them is even being generous."
AWFUL. The most incompetent delivery service in the world. The government should honestly do something. A simple search of Canadapost only has negative reviews. Why do Canadians need to deal with this?!
"Canada Post, No mail in 2 weeks. Jan 31. Need a service ticket number, okay made a service ticket. No follow up by Canada Post. I called back, Feb 1. service ticket closed. Answer was bad weather and they are not responsible for mail delivery. Really Canada Post? New service ticket with escalation. Today we have started too deliver mail. Feb 2 and 3 called back. ""you will receive by Feb 4. Well Feb 4 no mail. Answer you might receive by Feb 6. New escalation call us tomorrow.
I would even pick it up myself, I know where to go. No sorry only members of Canada Post allowed.
Sudbury, Timmins, east coast have a lot of snow but they have not missed a day of mail. Toronto had too much snow for people to deliver mail.
I wish I could tell my boss, sorry to much snow can't go to work but pay me anyway."
"Customer service is a joke, all they told me is the same thing that you see online. They keep asking for more money and their service is abhorrent! They strike before Christmas holding Canadians hostage over the holiday season just to leverage a deal. Unions foster employees who don't care, do a terrible job and keep getting more and more money and benefits.

My package was coming from West Van to Vancouver, message below;

""Your parcel may be delayed
Unfortunately, we made an error sorting your parcel. We‚Äôre trying to correct it, and we‚Äôre committed to delivering your parcel as requested. We‚Äôre sorry for any inconvenience or delay.""

How do you make a mistake sorting when everything is scanned and bar coded?

Now I won't get my parcel until NEXT WEEK! Canada Post needs to restructure get rid of union dead wood and hire decent employees who give a damn about service and doing their job properly!"
"I ordered items on saturday, they shipped on monday, which is normal, the expected delivery date was this wedensday, now (friday) it's been sitting in Richmond BC for four days without update and they pushed my delivery date to next monday. I'm never paying Canada Post for priority again. I will step on my values and use private companies from now on."
"Very disappointed. They left our package outside, in front of of the door, while we live downtown in a very active neighbourhood. Anybody could've stole it. They left no notice on the door."
"Accidentally delivered a package with a pseudonym. Had 5 different piece of ID with my name, or Address on it, had one ID with both the name and Address but it was a hospital card so they wouldn't accept it. They kept asking for an electricity bill, but I pay all my bills online because, y'know, 21st century.

Brought a package I had received 3 DAYS ago from the same place with my name and address on it, I was told I could have moved out in 3 days and it wasn't good enough.

Finally after going back home for the 3rd time, managed to find a videotron contract from 2017 and somehow THAT got accepted.

Also in 2013 they lost my art portfolio for a highly restricted program and nearly cost me my university admission. I hate this company with an unfathomable passion."
"Horrible service. If you can even call it service. Waiting for 3 packages. All of which are now at a location that I haven't been advised of. And the driver said if was my request to hold the packages at this unknown location of Canada post. No one even came to my door- I have been home. Literally the worst service. Then when I click ""where is my package"" they say check a bush ....really so I need a treasure map ! DO YOUR JOB & deliver I say again DELIVER! It is not my job to deliver myself and pick up my package when I paid for door delivery."
"My items sitting locally for 2 days so far
Must be too cold for the loosers there to go outside
Hope they Feel like delivering soon
Doubt it"
Haven't had mail delivery for two days. It seems they never deliver during bad weather or really nice weather the last couple of years. Too coincidental.
Canada Post has become a real pain in the .....! i paid to receive my order in 48h! MONDAY!!!!!!!! it's even written on their site that my order is due for today!!! STILL WAITING!!!!!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
"I wish all my packages could be shipped by purolator or FedEx cause they know how to actually do their JOB, if you can‚Äôt handle delivering mail, time to get a different job. Sick of waiting for my packages and them always being late, when being shipped by Canada post, other shippers such as FedEx and Purolator seem to be able to get their job done properly and officiant."
"I cannot for the life of me, get a package delivered through Flex Delivery. On 3 different occasions I have had the same package lost every time. Like totally lost. Like going from Calgary to Saskatoon and they are searching in Providence Bay lost. Made 5-6 tickets all with no result and chatting with 4 different reps to still have no clue where any of these packages are. They can't even give me any answers as to why this keeps happening. I really need this package but I feel like I could have it sent 10 times and still never get it. Never had a problem when not using Flex Delivery. Why offer a service that simply does not work ... like at all!"
Worst ever spent $67 to send a few legal papers to Colombia and it took 2 weeks just to leave the country when it was guareteed for 4 to 8 days. Please just tell people you can not guarentee and we choose a service we can rely on as I my case it has caused serious problem legally that I can reverse. Terrible service!
"Having used more than 20 nationally subsidized postal services, CP ranks dead last. Which is embarassing because I am from Canada. Got hung up on by a customer service rep today for having the nerve to where a package I shipped was."
"really sad/pathetic what this company has come to be....I get small parcels from various big box stores , Seattle to Vancouver and they take anywhere from 6-8 weeks to arrive , 5 days after shipping tracking says it has reached its destination country, then it takes Canada Post 6+ weeks to sort and deliver
dont get me started on them just leaving cards and no attempt delivery,happens every single time in our neighborhood, literally make a run for it"

"I made some hand-dyed shirts for some friends as a Christmas gift. I sent my package from Victoria to Burnaby BC paying $20 for next day service. My friends did not receive any tags or notification that the package had arrived. Perhaps this was affected by the ongoing Canada Post labour dispute. Four days after the send date my friends went overseas for Christmas so they missed the package. When my friends tried to follow up with Canada Post after Christmas they couldn‚Äôt get any info on the package. Everntually the package was returned to a postal office close to me. I was told at the office that I would have to pay $17 to pick up the package as it was the return to sender fee. So with this fee and the money it would cost me to send the gift to Burnaby again I‚Äôd be paying close to $60.
I called customer service and was told that Canada Post did ship the parcel the next day and had left a tag for my friends to pick the package up at their local post office. I explained that my friends had never received a tag. I was told by the rude and inept customer service representative that it was my responsibility to send my friends the tracking number so that they could hunt down the package. This when they hadn‚Äôt even received a tag. I was obviously unimpressed and I was about to leave a negative review regarding the level of service I had received on Canada Post‚Äôs questionnaire which I had opted to complete but I was never put through to the questionnaire. I‚Äôm fairly certain the representative somehow bypassed the questionnaire so she wouldn‚Äôt get a poor review.
To sum up this postal service is poorly run, has exhorbitant prices and takes no responsibility for their poor service. It will cost me less money to purchase and dye new t-shirts than it will to retrieve them from Canada Post and re-send the original package. My original package will not be picked up and will thus be destroyed. What a waste of time, money and energy Canada Post! Your service is inefficient and your employees need to be better trained in customer service!!!"
"Worst ever post service in the world. For international shipping, constantly lost mails. Nothing was done over the years. Very disappointed!"
"The worst company I have ever dealt with. Been waiting for my winter coat since January 17th. The delivery guy does not even try to knock on the door just leaves a card but someone is always home. I have been calling them every day and being told by them that a ticket (useless) has been raised and a ""re-attemp"" will be made the following day and each time they disconnect the call. I have even tried to get them to send it to a post office I can physically get to (am partially disabled walk with a cane as no feeling in my right leg) but they can't even do that. So tired of bad customer service not sure what else I can do. Any ideas?"
Lost my package and completely useless customer support team.
"A Christmas gift went ""missing"" over the holidays. Canada Post said it was delivered but it never was. I opened a ticket but got no where because they said it was delivered. Case closed, Basically means they can steal your packages and there's nothing you can do about it. Had to open a police report like I have before."
"Extreamly dissipointed in the services provided. The last 3 parcels I have had delivered have been opened. And one has been damaged . absolutly unexceptable .
Close up shop Canada Post. Or hire people who have respect for other peoples property/ mail"
"Packages rarely arrive on time, fraudulent delivery attempts."
"If I can give them 0 I surely will.Its not easy to make money and order something and just get lost.Whoever deliver my parcel did not do their job properly .I hope you understand how its feels to lose something,your hard earn money .It says my package was delivered and on my community box.No keys on my mail box and its my headache to follow up the sender for refund.i have to do all the follow ups just to have my money back.
Canada post you should install cameras on your vehicle so next tie you can check your people if they are doing their job correctly!! ABOVE ALL ITS A HASSLE FOR US!
PLEASE DO IMPROVE YOUR SERVICES AND LET YOUR STAFF BE MORE ATTENTIVE WITH WHAT THEY ARE DOING.NOT JUST DELIVERING ITEMS TO THE WRONG ADDRESS .
ITS UPSET US AND FRUSTRATES US KNOWING WE WORK HARD FOR WHAT WE PURCHASE.L AND HERES YOUR STAFF NOT PAYING ATTENTION!
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE COORDINATING WITH THE SENDER NOT US RECEIVER HAVING HEADACHES TO FILE FORMS HERE AND THERE WHEN IN THE FIRST PLACE YOUR STAFF WERE THE ONES WHO LOST THE ITEM."
"If I could minus zeros I would! This company is a joke. They gave two business packages to some unknown person and now they can't locate them.In other words they delivered our parcels elsewhere and could care less about it. How can this be allowed to continue to happen? This is certainly not the first time and on a personal note I have been awaiting the arrival of a package from the United States since October 16th, 2018 they have no idea where it is and they won't even try looking for it. Disgusting is what I have to say! Should be dissolved and everyone should lose their jobs."
Crap service like usual. I was forced to give a star just to comment. The only star they get is a brown star üòâ.
"This post office should be closed. They are just losing people's legal documents and everything you mail. I am so depressed right now. I can't believe they will not know where my legal documents are ,eventhough it was a priority mail. Come on somebody.... this is serious .."
"When I checked our mail today at our community mailbox, I found a parcel delivery notice dated for today. I was home all day long and no one came to my door to attempt a delivery. This has happened multiple times, another recent time being on Christmas Eve. Again were home all day and there was no attempted delivery. Are carriers who drive delivery vehicles and have parcels with them not required to attempt to deliver the packages to our door anymore? I understand if it‚Äôs a large package but these were average sized boxes. I‚Äôve also had situations in which parcels were forcibly shoved into our small community mailbox, sometimes resulting in damage to my items. There were a couple of times that I couldn‚Äôt even get the packages out of our mailbox and I actually had to use scissors to cut into the package so I could either remove items or collapse the box enough so I could remove it."
"Nothing is good to be said about Canada Post. I shipped my brand new GoPro ($570) back to GoPro in Mississauga for an RMA. I chose standard shipping and she asked what insurance would I need. I replied that it was worth near $600 and she said ""we have an insurance cap of $100"" meaning that if they lost the item that they would be covered and only pay me $100. I don't understand how a company that you are trusting with your package, can lose it and not give you anything in return.

Long story short, I shipped the item out on January 2, 2019; the lady said with the selected shipping it should arrive within a few days. It is now, January 21, 2019 and I have received no update to where my package is. The last update was an arrival scan on January 7th, 2019. GoPro was contacted and they said they have not received it yet. Canada Post has refused to take accountability and all they said was they will ""look into it."""
"Pathetic company. Package came from B.C to Mississauga in 2 days, but from Mississuga to Brampton it has been more than a week now. I also paid extra for expedited delivery and this is just taking way too long from one city to another. Another thing is that their email notifications are horrible. It says that my package keeps leaving the facility and then heading right back."
If I could give them no stars at all I would!!! Tracking is never up to date a couple weeks ago on a sunday the delivered a package that was worth 700 dollars but it didnt even say out for delivery it said it was still in richmaond bc (I'm in ontario) then about 20 mins later it says delivered... thankfully we were home to get it our it most likely would have been stolen with the way they just leave it in your front porch.. today it says our package says it's been delivered since 8:05 am it's now 10:25 and still no traces of our package. Ever since this strike has happened these workers are so lazy and slacking!!! If I ever have a choice I will NOT ship canada post & they will be my very last resort.
Horrible beyond belief!!! I'm an Ebay seller and have been for 19 years with 100% Feedback rating. I few weeks ago i paid over $400 for International Xpresspost shipping to ship a rare vintage boombox radio to the UK. The boombox never did arrive and as of today is Jan 20th is still missing! The expected delivery date was Jan 3rd .... My buyer is understandly very upset and so am i since this radio was very valuable and the most i could insure for was $1000 Canadian but it is worth over 3X that much and these clowns lost it! This was a HUGE box weighing over 15 kilos and measured 90 x 54 x 33 cm and it was clearly labled with not one but two shipping labels so how can they lose something like that...CANADA POST can lose anything!
Despicable. Should go bankrupt.
"Last week we accidentally mailed a small package (7‚ÄùX5‚ÄùX3‚Äù thick), without postage. It got mixed in with some postage paid parcels. I fully expected the package to be returned to us for the postage due and or charged to the receiver before delivering.
To our surprise and complete delight, the package was delivered without postage to the entended party.
Thank you so much for this exceptional Customer Service. It was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated.

There delivery from Mississauga facility to muskoka is often a joke. 2.5 hour drive takes 1 to 2 weeks to arrive after many unexplainable mishaps. Pathetic. Don't use Canada post if possible! There's only one way to get rid of them as I personally multiple times never get what I paid for. I paid for the service zero refunds no sorries. A horse and buggy would be twice as fast
"Canada Post is a joke

It takes them more time to ship priority from Toronto to muskoka than purolator does from Vancouver to muskoka. I‚Äôve used CP 20 times in the last year with over 10 of them taking at least 5 days for a priority shipping that says 2 days. On more that 5 occasions they have shipped my package the total wrong direction only to end up back where in was the day before. We need to boycott their service!!!"
"I have placed order online and they were delivering the item in 12 days which was okay because i had the event in next two days . But when i was looking for the order status, it said that the order is returned back due to incomplete address, they should have called me for the confirmation instead of making decision by themselves"
"Had four parcels set to arrive on one day. The two from private couriers arrived early, in good repair, and I was contacted on delivery -- with a photo of the delivered package even! Wow!

One Canada Post parcel arrived in the locker box and was damaged and leaking, but salvageable at least. Second item never arrived, updates stopped at 1pm. ""Come pick it up yourself"" card was left first thing the next day. No call despite being available. No updates online to the tracker.

Too long; didn't read --
->Private couriers - nailed it, 2/2
->Canada Post - damaged items, negligent delivery personnel, 0/2"
"terrible service! at the same time made an order from a store in Canada and a store in China! it has already arrived with China, there is no mississauga in mississauga! and most likely it will come in a week! and these workers are also on strike ?!"
"I just read another lady‚Äôs review and my story is exactly the same. I got a message from CP that they tried to deliver my item (a queen sized boxspring) but no one was home. False. My husband was home all day, and there was no delivery van, and no delivery card. 3 phone calls and 45 mins (or more) of my time to be told, we can go and pick up the large, heavy item ourselves the next day, and a depot supervisor will look into it and get back to us in 5 business days. What nonsense. So the delivery person doesn‚Äôt do their job AND lies about it, and we are supposed to do their job for them? And that is the only solution CP‚Äôs ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù department can offer? Where in the private sector would this be an acceptable level of customer service? And this doesn‚Äôt even sound unusual, according to other reviews I have read. Shame on Amazon for contracting to an incompetent, dishonest and unreliable company. I will not order anything through Amazon that is going to be delivered by Canada Post again."
"I hate Canada Post more than words can possibly express.

Was at home all day waiting for a package, got an email saying that I wasn‚Äôt home so they didn‚Äôt leave the package unattended. Nobody called or contacted me, nobody knocked on my door. Didn‚Äôt even leave a card with the information on it because they very clearly didn‚Äôt even enter my building, which is clearly labelled and never locked. Ha. They couldn‚Äôt find me? More like they couldn‚Äôt find their way out of their vehicle. I left detailed instructions, doesn‚Äôt matter. Now I have to go pick up my heavy package myself and carry it, which is the exact reason I was trying to get it delivered. If they try to deliver it again (and likely give up without making any attempt, again) it‚Äôll get returned to the sender. I don‚Äôt have time for this nonsense.

Why is their system so inflexible and user hostile? Is it because they have a monopoly on the market and we often have no other choice but suffer through their service? Thank god for Amazon prime. I will continue avoiding Canada post at all costs, lest I die of frustration."
"Had ordered item at eBay but NO tracking
in Canada post once arrived in Canada, the item never arrived home. 3 months later, had a ordered another item at eBay, tracking didn't work in Canada post, again the item disappeared. Honesty is the most important."
"Terrible, terrible, terrible! I really really dislike Canada Post. Rude, incompetent people. Slow, inflexible service. 19th century technology. And they even have the guts to go on strike to ask for more money?? With that level of service, you have to be paying us, the customers, to even consider your services! It's just a matter of time Amazon kicks you out and makes delivery methods optional, and then we'll see how you'll go on strike without that cushy taxpayer funded job and join the rest of your fellow Canadians who actually HAVE to work, HAVE to be polite to customers, and HAVE to be competent at our jobs to keep those jobs and to be paid!"
"I shouldn't be surprised. Canada Post lost my package and they make it difficult to start an investigation.
In my case, it's very obvious that the letter carrier is either lying or didn't do his/her job. What should have happened is a card left in my mailbox and I pick up the package at the local postal outlet but apparently, this time, the package (for some reason) was left on my doorstep or at one of my neighbour's doorsteps. The carrier was directly responsible for the loss/theft of my package (an electric snow shovel).
The story about what happened to my package changed 3-4 times (the first story from the letter carrier was that the shovel was left in my mailbox...which makes total sense....not!) but Canada Post will not look into it unless the shipper from China contacts them, which is difficult because they've done their job and don't care at this point.
But from the vast amount of negative reviews, it's obvious this will change nothing at Canada Post. No wonder they're struggling."
"Lost my package for my buddy who is ill...but said its delivered. Closed complaint quite fast, before i could get them more info...Opened another ticket, and no one contacted me in specified time..Called customer service and he had no info either...I gave him more info to contact my buddy who said she never got package...and also a screen shot text from her of No never got it! Customer service said supervisor or someone be contacting me in 48 bizz hours, but no one has...In mean time i called customer service again, with another number for ill buddys relatives ( to contact about NO PARCEL DELIVERED)...this fella said that was unaccepable the ticket was opened but no contact at all by CP...he escalated it and said Id hear from someone in 4 hours or by next day...never happened, and i waited around all day and evening (I have no cell, so sat by my landline)...so much BULL!!!! I have left a simple thing like a refund now in the hands of the OMBUDSMAN....and a nice thing I was doing for my buddy, well that turned out to be a crummy mess...no gift to cheer. Im beyond PO'd...and the run around is CRAP!"
"STOP NOW!
Stop buying from canada post. NO WAY
am I going to deal with them anymore after today, WHY is this ..I sent an application for housing from this small GHOST TOWN called trail, bc, on 3 january, to vancouver, which ROCKS! and today is 11 january, the letter DID NOT arrive. If it were JUNK mail it would have been in van overnight.
DO NOT WAIT to privatize postal services."
"GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY Crap!!!!
NEGATIVE FIVE STARS!!!!!!
Worst parcel service I had ever seen and I lived in the US and the US service is a 100 times better then Garbage Canada Post.
Canada Post will NEVER be on the the same level as (my home country) Dutch post service (Post NL) there not in the same category not even in the same league and that said let me explain how real post service works.
I‚Äôve ordered a parcel form Netherlands and the same day I ordered the item it was picked and processed, packed and shipped out the same day and arrived the second day cause of the 10 hour flight plus the time difference and you can‚Äôt tell me that that‚Äôs not impressive right and that‚Äôs not express just standard shipping so anyways it arrive in Toronto the next day and I said ok it should get delivered to my house in a day or two right, but that wasn‚Äôt the case it sat there for 3 days before I call them to see what‚Äôs the problem and they said they are processing my package even though they gave me two different arrival dates and still didn‚Äôt come through on those dates, that said and done they told me that it might take them a week to process it and ship it (THATS BULL) and they also said that I might have to come pick it up and that‚Äôs UNACCEPTABLE by any means, l already pay for the shipping and other fees so I can get it delivered to my house but if this Garbage Canada Post Office tell me to come pick up my package I WILL EXPRESS MY FEELINGS LOUDLY AND I WILL BE HERAD ON EVERY LEVEL.
I‚Äôm Fed up!!!!!!!!!
NEVER NEVER USE CANADA POST FOR PARCELS. Donkeys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Next time I ordered something I will go to great lengths to make sure that these Donkeys in Canada Post won‚Äôt touch it!
Canada Post should be ashamed of themselves for conducting business this way.
UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Is there an option for NO STAR! its a very worst customer service i have ever seen and this is how govt operates?! Crazy! Had to be on the phone with them all day in the week and finally when i went to pick the parcel they freaking charge money since the label says it went back to sender (when it never did)! better to shut down than spoiling your service.
"I don't really care for mail, all of my communications / billing is done electronically. My 1-star rating is for their parcel service.
There's no word to describe how bad this service is.
They don't even deliver parcels to the premise anymore, which makes services such as express post totally useless.
I also have to drive a 40km round trip to go to the post office to pickup parcels and I could go on and on.
That said, the clerks I'm usually dealing with at the PO is generally OK."
"The clerk gave me the wrong information and I paid more than I should have. I went back to tell her and she didn‚Äôt do anything about it, although she agreed she misinformed me. I called Canada post‚Äôs customer service twice and both times, they told me the clerk had to issue the refund. However, the clerk couldn‚Äôt do it. I called the third time and the rep cut me off, twisted the scenario and accused me of questioning the clerk‚Äôs integrity. Then she had the audacity to justify how she spoke to me by saying she wasn‚Äôt TRYING to be rude or mean. I had to deal with her rude tone for 35 minutes while she kept putting me on hold, challenging my character, and making me feel inferior. So unprofessional. The supervisor finally came on the phone after being on hold for 15 minutes and issued me the refund, saying it was an ‚Äúexception‚Äù and they wouldn‚Äôt do it for me again. Well, I hope not because that would mean I was misinformed again."
"It‚Äôs hard to believe that in this country we are so enslaved to a postal system that‚Äôs so backward, they‚Äôre gonna just make it more & more redundant, they‚Äôre charging us fees and have no concern that we don‚Äôt get much more than a pony-express service, absolutely disgusting ‚òπÔ∏è"
"I am continually shocked by the sheer depth of incompetence and mediocrity of service that Canada Post provides. Having lived in other countries and witnessed firsthand how a capable and competent postal service functions, it is difficult to standby and listen to the endless complaints and resulting strikes of a greedy and entirely undeserving staff. Shame on Canada Post. What do they offer? Terrible service at 4 times the price of other national couriers. That's what they offer. If it wasn't for the taxpayer this abomination would've sunk decades ago. Over a week to get a package from Vancouver to Victoria? Rude, short and ungrateful employees? Impossible to expect better when Canada Post employees are ensconced for life and answer to nobody? Yes, yes and yes. Shameful."
"i never got the gift that was sent to me for the holidays, the item was ordered in November and never arrived.
what kind of gongshow is canada post running?
their delivery service is hot garbage, it's amazing we even get mail...
bottom line thanks for ruining Christmas!
i can clearly see the postal service hires simians to do all the parcel shipping. 1000 monkeys in a warehouse cant go wrong"
"Their service is really really HORRIBLE...
My sister sent a percel with tracking number from Japan, but it wasn't trackable after it entered Canada for some reason. It took a month to get it although usually takes just a week.
My friend sent a letter with tracking number from UK, it happened again. TRACKING SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK here at all.

Moreover, a letter by EMS (fastest and most reliable, supporsedly) was so delayed that I called customer service, he told me there was nothing he could do...
It was from Japan so I needed to report Japanese post office first and they would contact Canada post... How ridiculous...
I know the item is in Canada from tracking....
There is 17HRS difference.... How could he say that...

If you are in hurry, you would better use a different carrier."
I've been trying to call their phone line for one question about an item and they or the bot just keeps hanging up repeatedly. terrible service.
I am a large business owner and receive a great deal of mail and parcels on a daily basis. I grow ever so frustrated that I have to send staff to the local drug store to collect parcels because Canada Post staff are too lazy to walk 30 paces to the side door where there is available staff when our security doors our locked and our reception is unattended over the lunch hour. We have communicated with Canada Post and the local driver time and time again but instead they leave notices for parcel pick-ups. Lazy just lazy.
"Most the time I'm pleased with service but they need to do something about there tracking system it is useless! We can't even rely on it so what is the point in having it...?? These people are alwease going on strike and there crappy at there job forgetting to scan things and sending them to the wrong location. Please fix these things or people will just switch to UPS
:)"
Hi. I‚Äôm not a happy with your customer service and I called your number and the lady wasn‚Äôt very helpful. You should be ashamed of yourself for taking a strike and then refusing to refund your customers money. Because you can‚Äôt contact the person. You only drop off a mail notice. FedEx and ups and dhl are away better with customer service then you guys are. It makes me sick that you are a Canadian company who treats their customers like garbage. They deserve a zero. Too bad that I have to give them a 1 star rating because they don‚Äôt deserve a star.
"I have never had a delivery service make so many mistakes! Beyond displeased with Canada post. Zero stars. Would not recommend. Has lost a dozen packages in the last two months, has delivered many packages late, has delivered them damaged. Have watched postal workers throwing boxes around in their truck outside our house. One worker consistently walked up to the house with package slip and no package and left it in the mail box without even bothering to knock. WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE!"
"I would have to say that as a small business owner that depends on canada post services, the most frustrating part of it is exactly that. For customers to be paying high fees to have their packages shipped in descent time only to wait for months (canada to USA), is beyond outrageous. Their customer service is horrible. Waiting for over an hour to get to someone only to get lame excuses and no help is a shame for our national postal provider. Will be looking into other options for sure."
"I am waiting to get my delivery from the post office for days. Everytime when I go there they just say ""it is not here yet and you should come again tomorrow"". I am curious how many days later it will be delivered to the post office after I got the delivery notice? The most strange thing is that I saw lots of complaints about Canada Post and no one cares and tries to fix the system."
"I shipped my item (gift) last Dec. 24, 2018 to USA and my Fiancee received it January 4, 2019. Though he received it on time unfortunately the package is sliced open and the item was STOLEN. I called Canada Post right away and said that they CAN'T DO anything about it as they can't track the item when it reached to USA. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!! They're not helping at all, they are just adding more stress to their customer. At least provide a proper answer and solution, Canada Post because people are struggling as well to make money, and that stolen item is not easy to make! Handle our packages well, and should know that everything is IMPORTANT no matter the value is! One more thing, train your Agent well as well as your counter cashier!"
"Canada Post is dismal. The front line workers are just doing their jobs, but the corporation needs a correction, competition and perhaps a swift kick. My own experience is just beyond words.

I recommend is that everyone, every business stops using or relying on Canada Post to make them understand that they have a duty to earn our business and send a clear message."
"I would give zero stars or negetive stars if I could. I am currently looking for a supplier that uses anybody other than Canada post xpresspost. It's an absolute joke. Packages sit for days in one place, not moving. I had a package start out in Surrey, headed for Edmonton. Put in mail on December 28. Since that time, it has moved 35 km west (further away from me) to Richmond. 8 days to move further away from me and just sit there. The 2-3 business day delivery is such a laugh! They don't do what they say they're going to, and they don't give a crap. Nobody knows anything, nobody has any answers, they just DONT CARE. If you have ANY other options, use them. Canada post Xpresspost is really really really BAD."
"Canada Post is king of the lack of accountability. In the last year alone I have had at least 3 packages delivered to the wrong address, but according to Canada Post that never happened (good thing people a block away are chill..) I have also recieved multiple parcels to random people, and when you do get your mail it looks like someone power punched it into the mail box. My favorite is when my wife's prescription eyeglasses were delivered and signed for at the bank she works at, 2hrs before it was open. Canada post's response when asked where the parcel is, ""Well it was signed for. Can you check around the complex and see if someone else accepted it."" Followed by, ""we cannot tell you who signed for it, you weren't the one who sent the parcel."" If you really want to see the stellar service provided by our tax dollars, try and have a parcel delivered to your home. No knock on doors, no ring of doorbell, just a ""delivery attempted"" notification put on your door, that, wait for it, you can't pick up until the next day after 13oo (contrary to their tracking) Why not save time and just give a parcel card.. oh because you charge for to the door delivery... so that must just make them crooks."
The packages I sent abroad never delivered on time. They were always delivered much later than the date it was supposed to. Once I sent a letter which was very important and they never received it at the destination.
"I am a senior citizen with disabilities living in a small town that likes to call itself a city: Canada Post is the only delivery service offered here. And as I have spent most of my life in rural settings - on the side of a mountain in N.S., in a settlement in S. Ont., a RV park in the far north - I've had to rely solely on their services. And for the most part, I would say with few problems - parcels, letters, flyers - all made their way quite successfully to my home or post box. And I have found their staff to be courteous & helpful on most occasions - one cannot blame a whole organization based on one or two bad experiences.
I now live in an apartment building & have come to know 3 of the Canada Post carriers as I find it easier to order on line & have the items, be they books, vitamins, shelving units, or clothing, delivered right to my door. In fact its a pleasure to hear an early morning knock on my door as I know I'll be getting something I want. There have been glitches - like the holding of mail when one's away - I thought I had to pick it up at the central dispatch, they said it had to be delivered to my box on a certain day to complete the contract..
But, while I have had little to no hassles with Canada Post, the same cannot be said for all delivery/shipping firms or indeed all government postal services: Russia & India are notoriously slow but you generally do get your stuff whereas on the 2 occasions I've had DHL imposed on me, my parcels have gone MIA & I suspect I have bought somebody some very nice gifts."
"Absolutely horrible delivery times. Packages sit in sorting facilities for days without movement. I will not purchase from any company that uses Canada Post. I do not need them. Their courier competitors are better, cheaper, fast. Can't wait until this dinosaur is gone for good."
"My Packages arrived in the city days ago, but are just sitting at the distribution center. I'd sooner just drive there and pick them up myself. Brutal... Do we really need Federalized Mail?"
"Canada Post needs to be shut down, we are no longer in the 80's when they held everyone hostage NOT doing their job, going on strike at the worst time.
EVERY SINGLE time I order something from any company that ships via Canada Post there is an issue . I spend approximately $500 per month on online shopping, I will no longer shop online from any company that ships with Canada Post!
They just don't care.. their attitude is you get it when we can get around to delivering it to you, no standards at all, they seem to think they are above anyone, and they certainly are NOT.
People need to start standing up with our country's ridiculous mail service!!"
"I'm very disappointed with my experience with Canada Post. Unfortunately my community only has a Canada Post Office, and no other, so my only option is to go with Canada Post, and they never deliver my package to my house!

Every time I order my medication I'm forced to go to the post office and either provide ID, or get my notice, which should have been left on my door, from my postal box and pick it up there. This is ridiculous!

Today I come to realize that Canada Post hasn't even been stopping by my house! Today when I arrived home from work I checked my tracking progress only to see that early this morning, when I was home, there was a ""notice card left indicating where and when to pick up item."" No one knocked on my door, no notice was left. Because I arrived home after the post office was closed, I wasn't able to pick up my medication, which I have already had to go several days without because of delays. I am VERY upset at this point.

I filed a complaint ticket with Canada Post, and phoned them directly to see if they could at least get me my package today, considering that it is very important for me to have. The representative I spoke with told me that they could not deliver my package to me, and also explained that apparently they couldn't deliver due to ""traffic delays"" such as high traffic, weather, etc.

Now, normally I would be understanding of this, however, today was a beautiful day outside, and I live in a small town with little traffic. My guess is that the delivery guy simply uses the ""traffic delays"" excuse quite frequently to avoid delivering packages or leaving notices.

Very upset with the service."
"Absolute trash of a company and employees, would love to explain my review.. but if you read the other 962 you will find out yourself."
"I was supposed to receive a package I paid $40 for, and they said they would leave a card at my front door stating where my package is, and I never got it! Now I am upset and can't find my package. All I can see on the website is that it is at a post office. I have 0 clue which post office and now I have to search all over Toronto for my package. Screw you Canada Post. I feel bad for my son too because it was his PC gear. Make my kid upset too!"
"It's been 2 months that I sent a tracked mail to France, it has still not arrived, it cost me in total more than 110$ to process it, they are gonna refund me 45$ by ""check"", saying that they are not 100% sure it was lost. Lol, it's been 2 months that I sent it come on !
Waste of money and waste of time!"
"Other delivery companies doesn't have any troubles delivering my packages to my door, except for Canada Post, who says they attempted delivery and even though I was at home they did not actually try.

So I know that their claim is untrue. I don't own a vehicle the drop off is at least two blocks away, a Canada post worker can't deliver to my door but I'm expected to walk two blocks with a 16lb box?

This attempt was made on 12/10/2020. This has been common practice before a pandemic."
"The worst company ever same for purolator all they ever do is to strike for no reason and destroy our Christmas.If they don‚Äôt pay enough money so go work for another company that way they will
Have no one that works there."
this crown corporation is scamming Canadian citizens of their money by lying about their delivery dates. screw you Canada Post and get your sheet together
"Drivers never attempt to drop off packages. Just stick a slip onto the door. This is our front door, we're sitting right behind it and never, NEVER, have they simply knocked. Always have to take a day off work and go to a damned post office and pick up the package that the driver didn't bother to deliver. Absolutely useless. Ups, DHL, FedEx, any are better options. National mail carriers have a place, but Canada post needs to be replaced by a well run service that trains employees. There literally isn't even an option to email thier customer service, they expect you to do it over twitter. Garbage."
"I cannot believe that a MASSIVE crown corporation like this one can't get organized and provide us with proper deliveries!!! This is the second time, IN-A-ROW that my package has not been delivered on time. I received a gift from a friend, she paid expedited shipping fr my package to arrive on December 27th. y package shows delivered to community mailbox...NOPE it's not delivered, it's not in my community mailbox! I called Post Canada twice and wasn't able to get ANY concrete answers...only a fluffy general answer that I HAVE to wait 3 days for them to get back to me...Today, is day three, no package no phone call.Meanwhile my ta dollars are still paying those salaries that are NOT well utilized.WHERE is my GIFT? Does my friend get a refund for the $$$ she paid for expedited shipping?
No one can give me concrete answers. WHY? Amazon should teach Canada Post how to run a successful business! It sucks that we are forced to use Canada Post this year they have lost 2 packages!!! What the hell...amazon.ca has lost 0 packages, delivered on time and sent me emails during the delivery process. Can someone explain?"
"Honestly, payed for express post, had my delivery date change 3 times already and is now 2 weeks late. I leave the country in another week. So if it is delayed again, guess who threw away their money? I wish sites offered which postal service they were using so Canada Post got data to indicate that they suck."
"I was at home the whole day and they leave ""Attempted delivery. Notice card left indicating where item can be picked up. "" on the delivery information. They didn't try to deliver it.
Even more, I didn't even find any notice card.
This is so stupid. worst delivery service ever!!!"
"These uneducated hicks should be more than happy that they get paid a starting wage of 19$/hour. They get paid far above minimum wage to hand out mail and there are so many lower paying jobs that are much more unpleasant. Maybe if they didn't waste time going on strike instead of doing their jobs, they'd deserve the higher pay but at the moment, these useless degenerates are way overpaid. If you're someone who's looking to ship any item for any reason, use any other mailing company. Hopefully this useless burden on society (they're government subsidized by the way) is eradicated by the lack of demand."
I'd give a zero star if it was available - this is the worst company Canada has to offer - a total shame on Canada post for destroying Canada's reputation with their pathetic service! hire monkeys - you'd get better results - conclusion? CANADA POST IS A COMPLETE DISGRACE - someone needs to take over for these donkeys as they can't do their job correctly - fire all and hire humans with brains.
"Canada post employees need to get rid of their union reps, or union all together. They have a stressful enough job at Christmas without being told they now have to go on strike and have the ENTIRE Canadian population HATE them. I work retail, people suck especially at Christmas. They take their frustration out on the first person they see whether it‚Äôs their fault or not. As a country we need to be reaching higher. CP is our main delivery and postal service. When we order things online we don‚Äôt have a choice whether it goes through CP or not. We are stuck. And as a country we need to fix it. Yelling at our local delivery person is not going to do anything. We need to aim for the head. We need to stop whining about our individual problems and fix this disaster we call a postal service. If we band together we can take them out."
"My Parcel took over a month to be delivered to me. When I check the tracking number for this package, I was given the options, where I wanted the parcel to be delivered to 1.my Community mailbox, or 2.delivered to my house, I asked to have my package delivered to my house, I waited all day for this package to be delivered, so finally I checked the tracking number again, and it was delivered to my community mailbox. Why do they give you the options where you can have your package delivered to, and not do it? Very bad customer service and then demanding and expecting more money."
"Items arrived at 10.30 am in Mississauga. Expected to be delivered to me on the same day because I live in North York, and they didn't. I have to wait 2 more days for the package."
"They shut their tracking services down from Thursday night until Monday morning. These guys are the absolute worst delivery service in the world. Ordered modem via Canada Post that shipped from Toronto to Kitchener (1 hour drive). Took 3 MONTHS with Xpress shipping (1-2 day guarantee). Meanwhile UPS shipped me a parcel in 1 day from Toronto on EXPEDITED SHIPPING. Fact is that these guys are crooks! Canada post will not be getting any money from me OR MY SHIPPER YOU GUYS ARE A JOKE! Thanks for the free delivery due to your horrible service, which apparently refunds the shipper. I am very disappointed with this company. Go back on strike you cowards!"
"I am sad to say that I will no longer be ordering from companies that use Canada Post as its shipper. I can no longer handle the poor service, poor tracking mechanism and lack of door delivery. This holiday was the final straw when I had to spend twice the money as my November shipments via Canada Post did not arrive for Christmas. Unacceptable!"
"Canada Post is very inflexible when it comes to refund. There are always exceptional cases, but Canada Post tends to tend to stick to policies to avoid refunds. I purchased the Priority envelope and the Canada Postal Office representative did not tell me that there is a one day delay due to the holiday rush. I was informed that the package will reach the next day. It reached the same time as the Express Post. Therefore, as per their policy, I am eligible for a refund if the package does not reach on time. After spending 3 hours explaining on chat and phone my case, they had come back saying no. Not even willing to pay half the amount. It was only CAD 40. Given that people rely on them and the business they get, they can afford to be a bit flexible and nicer to repeated customers."
"Sent out on Dec.14th; has been sitting in Toronto since the 15th, has not moved, it is now the 27th and no one knows where it is; I paid for express post and all they can say is have the sender send in a ticket; W T F is that gonna do for anybody. These glorified junk mail delivery service is useless and needs to be shut down; Then the entitled A-Holes that constantly want more money for doing less work; wont have to worry about doing any work at all. If they would have said they couldnt guarantee the Xpress post. I would have used a better alternative or just not made my order at all."
"Canada post is garbage, ive always had problems with them in the past with late deliveries, Missing scans etc, but this time they lost 2 of my packages. Theyre the most spoiled delivery provider ive ever seen, they dont care about customer satifaction, only about employee beneficials. I will never again be using canada post out of choice again. I cant express in words how frusterating it is having to deal with Canada post, for future customers please take these words, and keep clear of them for your own sake and sanity. Take your business to a company who actually deserves your money!"
My package was supposed to arrive on December 22nd and it still says in transit I have to wait until January 3rd for my ticket to finish just so they can tell me my package is missing aka it was stolen canada post is a bunch of goofs lazy good for nothing tax subsidized losers who have never once delivered my package to my door the whole thing should be cut up and sold to the private sector where this kinda behavior wouldnt be acceptable why do any of you deserve a raise when u dont even do the minimum required of you
"They on purposely refused to deliver a small package on Christmas Eve, due to a carrier truck running out of storage space, and all this thanks to their recent strike just before Christmas.

Thanks Canada Post for ruining Christmas this year! What a major disappointment that was with this company."
"Sadly - horrible. Government based jobs, with all the benefits and still not enough. Service is expensive, not reliable, slow and super messy. Strike before Christmas 2018 was very un-ethical. I missed bunch of gifts because of that and I always buy way ahead of time.
Shame of you Canada Post and government that allow such a lousy service."
They had 1week and two days from USA to Canada and it took over that time.....no wonder there going down
"They passed at my appartment and they put the sticker on the first door, which is always unlocked. They didn‚Äôt knocked on my door. So i couldn‚Äôt know it arrived. 20 minutes later i called them to ask if i could take it directly at the post office, they said yes. When i arrived they told me they couldn‚Äôt give me my package cause the delivery guy went back home. He freaking went back home. It is December 24th and now i need to wait until Thursday 27 to have my gift. Thank you Canada Post. It‚Äôs not the first time i don‚Äôt have something on time. Always the same thing. Stop your strike and go back to work instead of ruining people‚Äôs Christmas."
"Why does a post office not have tape ?
. I had to buy tape from you before I could send my packadge. If there was any other postal service closer then Dartmouth I would use it. Considering travelling there from now on !!! No hours no phone available... crap job"
"Ordered a jacket from Sportchek - took three weeks to arrive instead of 7-10 days. Not home when they tried to deliver so Canada Post left a call card and told me to go to Post Office in Shoppers Drug Mart to pick up. Went next day - not there - went day after not there - cashier shrugged and said you will have to go to Main Post Office and they will have to find it. Went to main post office - was told the Supervisor would have to look into it and would call me back. Three days went by and no call - called the supervisor who told me no one had given her my information. Very aggressive - basically told me I would just have to be patient and the situation wasn't her fault. Very rude and unhelpful. Received a call three days later saying that yes, they had delivered my parcel to the wrong address but couldn't be sure where!! Told to call Canada Post customer service. Called Canada Post Customer Service and spoke to yet another person who really couldnt give a crap that they had lost my parcel (a $300 North Face Jacket for my son). They told me I would have to go back to Sport Check and have them investigate. Worst customer service EVER and it is no wonder Canada Post is in such a mess. I will do everything I can in future NOT to use Canada Post - I urge everyone to sign up wherever possible for paperless billing so Canada Post and all their ""can't give a crap"" employees are out of work."
My christmas gifts have been sitting at the depo 10min from my house and I cannot pick them up. Even with amazon prime i still havent receive them..The managers response was ‚Äú well print a picture of your christmas gifts‚Äù.:. Well gee thank you! That solves my $ problem!
"My package has been sitting at the distribution office which is 5 km from my house for 10 days. Expected delivery day according to the online tracking was few days ago, no one refreshed information on the website. Called them, say they don't know when they will deliver. My question is if the online system is not up-to-date and they cannot provide any information on the phone how people supposed to know what is going on. I would pick up my package, but of course it is not possible with Canada Post. Why you cannot transfer your package to a place where you can pick it by yourself like with e.g. Purolator?"
"Horrible, went on strike and delayed my package for a month and then refused to deliver even though at 10 am the package was half an hour away from me. Sucks so bad I cant even describe, I am livid"
"Canada Post is the absolute worst service ever!!!!!!
I cannot believe Google and Amazon are using this company it's absolutely ridiculous!!!!
2 shipments in a row 5 -day delays important items electronic chatting that is useless
No way to hold them accountable unbelievable bad service
I hope Canada Post goes completely out of business I can't believe they had the audacity to go on strike
such a dinosaur with this type of service
I predict those lazy antiquated union workers will all be out of a job within 2 years
they will be gone within 24 months
gone the way of the buggy whip"
"My package has been ""On Delivery"" for 4 days now. I contact customer service and get told they ran out of time and will be out the next day. The next day never comes. Amazon looked into it and they can see after Monday the package was never rescanned when it supposedly went back. Amazon even contacted Canada Post and they are opening an investigation. That means nothing. It was bad enough that I paid for express and it took 2 weeks for it to even appear at my local station. Then it sat there for 5 days. The station is 10 minutes from me. My town is not that big so there is no excuse. So I see it as it has been taken (second time a package went out for delivery and never was seen again) or it us sitting in the station and being ignored. Their delivery service is beyond terrible. They want more money for what? They get paid more than well enough for the crappy service they provide."
"Wish I could give it ZERO. Made a delivery to a client 10 days after the strike and its in their bs ""backlog"". Biggest damn operator in the nation and they couldn't clear their backlog with their huge staff.....yeah right. It normally takes 3-4 days and its been 7 days and no update tracking info to be found..."
"I suppose to receive a shipping from Russia.
Never receive, when I called to know where it is, they said the adress was wrong, and they could deliver. I ask, why no one call me for, and they simply said, we was waiting your call, since no one call us, we could shipped and return the product. And said we don't have to call are customer for that.

Ps: the adress was good."
"Often late delivery, plus rude employees at my local Canada Post locations. They don't seem to believe the customer is always right, nor do they ship with a smile. Come on, Canada Post employees, if you don't like your job that much stop going on strike like children and quit your job like an adult would!
Canada Post is the worst shipping/delivery company I know of. It's beyond me how this disgrace of a company can remain in business!"
"I'd like to thank everyone at Canada Post, who though often under-appreciated, undervalued and under-noticed do an outstanding job and have never failed me lo the six-and-a-half decades I have relied on them.
‚Äì Mark, Vancouver, BC Canada"
"It is sad how many times a company that a mass majority of people rely on in canada and others around the world, can go on strike for months every year or 6 months, like why are you all being so petty I do 19 hr shifts in the snow along with 1,000s 9f others, this company already is slow enough and loses packages and shows up 4 days late with you package is normal when your not on strike now its triple that, do not rely on this company it may be extra but just go with a more private company if you would like your mail within a decent time frame because canada post is the worst service from any business ever"
"A poor & terrible service. They lost my trackable & registered mail. If I can give them a zero for service & performance, I would."
"So, I am typically not one to write a review for anything but I feel very disrespected at this point that I truly believe this is deserved. So to start off I am applying for permanent residency which is quite costly and very time consuming to complete all of the paperwork. I mailed it off last month (Nov 10th) only to recieve half of my paperwork back today with a little letter from Canada post explaining that is was ""lost"". Also lets include the fact that their little letter was rather disrespectful blaming the customer for the lost items. Quoted directly from them ""Our customers can also help us to reduce the damage by ensuring that the items they mail are adequately packaged to withstand normal postal handling."" We had our paperwork in a new brown envelope that was sealed and then taped shut. I would love to see ""normal handling"" that would break apart an entire envelope. This is the worst service I have ever seen, I now have to reprint and find all the information for my paperwork again. Luckily I still have access to all the information or I would be stuck spending another 1,500.00$ paying to complete my paperwork again."
"Canada Post, is terrible! They can't even be bothered to look at the names on the call box, just outside of the building, and buzz me to see if I'm home for a delivery.

If they can't fit it into my mailbox, they write up that stupid note and I have to pick it up, the next day, at the post office.

Not usually an issue, but I can't walk or drive due to chronic pain, at this time.

I would have happily trudged down to the lobby, with my cane, to pick it up, had someone even bothered."
"TRACKING# SAID DELIVERED. called in to canada post, meet with bad attitudes, excuses 3 to 4 day investigations, to out for delivery, person pressed the wrong button, to we will call you back, on line customer support hang ups, 5 days later on a sunday its delivered, huh, sunday?. post office called looking for a good review, 8 days later they delivered package to the wrong address. i guess i have to get larger than 6 inch tall numbers on my house.
post office is on strike i feel they don't need a raise most can't do there job on a good day. the last 20 years canada post has lost it, the employees are out of control, they should not be allowed to purge there poor performance records annually."
"Sent a package to Ireland on NOVEMBER 6TH from Vancouver for my family, full of their Christmas gifts. They STILL have not received anything. Any package I've sent before has taken 2 weeks maximum. I understand delays are in place but this is an absolute nightmare. Disgraceful company who are impossible to get any help from. AVOID AVOID AVOID at all costs."
My parcel arrived 10 minutes from where I live and got sent to wrong destination. Now it's back and has to be processed all over again and can not go and pick up. So much for Express post.
"ordered for well before christmas, was told it would arrived days before christmas, and then woke up this morning to an email saying indefinitely delayed
how dare you. you cannot indefinitely do anything. you‚Äôve taken people‚Äôs money, their christmas gifts, and their connection to eachother and you just don‚Äôt even ATTEMPT to do the job you are paid to do.
absolutely disgusting and if this package doesn‚Äôt come in before christmas i will be in your office to speak with an actual person instead you cowering behind an email."
"I ordered something that had 3 day shipping and it took a month to come in, only to get it and see that it was sliced open and taped back together, and then I opened it only to find that a CP worker had stolen my item and replaced it with garbage! It was not a cheap package either... 120.00 stolen from me only to be told they can‚Äôt do anything about it. Not impressed at all."
thank you for ruining my christmas canada post‚ù§Ô∏è
"Placed an order on December 11, the package was supposed to arrive next day seeing as though it was shipped via priority-domestically. The package has now been delayed indefinitely to the 21st of December. Absolutely ridiculous; any shipping company that can't maintain a working relationship with their employees should not be conducting business at all. Extremely disappointed with Canadapost and WILL NEVER use their services again!"
"I buy most of my goods online, I then scoot across the Houlton border and pick my goods up at a kinek point. This way the ebay sellers don't completely screw me over with ridiculous shipping prices to Canada as it's almost always free shipping within US. I made the mistake of buying within Canada for my daughter's Christmas present recently. Ontario to New Brunswick and it's looking like it's not going to make it here for Christmas. Fk Canada Post, back to USPS and kinek for me. The americans would be up in arms if their shipping corporation dared pull this crap at Christmas! Btw, USPS ships from California to Maine in like 4 or 5 days lol."
"I like Canada post, they offer guaranteed delivery of an average sized parcel to anywhere in Canada for $15.

1-3 days across the country guaranteed.

It's also a crown corporation. People don't know what they got until it's gone."
"Everything is always 3-10 days late. I say let them fail. It's time for the government to stop trying to run businesses, because it doesn't know how. End Canada Post."
"Another strike eh!?
Well, we heard from a union voice on the news ""we're not striking to hurt others...."" Seriously, what did you think would happen with a strike over the holidays and in this economy? You've crippled businesses during their busiest time of year. Not only did you cripple them but many will now close their doors. These businesses, as well as individuals, paid for a service to be provided by Canada Post out of their own pockets. These businesses and individuals had NOTHING to do with Canada Post's salary issues. This is theft and false advertising at it's finest and it's been allowed by our government. Also, I heard someone from the union claim that Canada Post has one of the most dangerous jobs. That comment is very interesting since I, along with many others, can think of many other professions that are far more dangerous, unhealthy, and pay far less. Also, I heard a voice state that Canada Post employees want more money.....so do I, but there's NO WAY that I would do this to so many people to get my way. If anything, I'd be embarrassed to be a Canada Post employee and find another job. Have some pride! My hope is that lawsuits pop up everywhere from those businesses that have had to close their doors. I'm hoping that those that paid for a service to have their items delivered by a certain date, not receiving them, and have had their lives impacted in some way, file a lawsuit. It's time for the public to stop allowing themselves to be a victim and held hostage to ridiculous practices that are not only outdated, but harmful."
"Ordered a package from B.C. Made it to Ottawa in under 24 hours, only 30 minutes from me. 3 days later, package has still not made it that last 30 minutes to my local post office. I believe CP is purposely delaying deliveries in response to the back to work legislation. End Canada Post, let them work for what most people with similar skill sets get and see how they enjoy that."
"Ah, Canada Post, the only consistent thing about your service is that you're consistently incompetent. With the added bonus of knowing that this year, you're extra super motivated to do the worst job ever because the big nasty government ordered you back to ""work."" Allow me to add my grief to the pile: Took the day off work to accept delivery of a time-sensitive Christmas package that was marked out for delivery at about 5:30 this morning (hahahahahaha, you don't do your jobs during normal work hours, why would anything be happening at 5:30 am?!) Didn't vacuum, didn't use my phone, didn't even stray too far from my front door so I could be right there to accept my delivery. Finally check the tracking info and see that without a phone call, without a knock on my door, my carrier left a slip. In my mailbox. Which he/she could only access by already being INSIDE my building. A few more steps and they might have actually made it to my door, but I get that that's just too much like honest, responsible work for the average Canada Post carrier, so left a slip they did. Telling me to pick it up my own damn self tomorrow at the post office. No carrier ID number on the slip either (although really, is it needed? They're interchangeably incompetent.) Tomorrow, of course, will make that whole time sensitive thing quite insensitive, as I needed that package today.

UPS showed up on my doorstep with a different package about two minutes later - nice dude, friendly, and most important of all, carrying out the duties of his job like an actual professional.

You're a lot of bumbling fools, Canada Post, and I hope the government, on behalf of all of us completely fed-up taxpayers, opens up the post-holiday strike negotiations with a full bodied invitation for you to shove it, HARD."
"Yes, Canada Post does suck and will ruin Christmas for a lot of people, but I think the fault actually lies with the union. Unions may have served a purpose at one time before there were laws protecting workers from abuse, but now unions are essentially a cancer that slowly ruins any industry they exist in, whether it's postal work, government, education or the auto industry. The fact of the matter is that some people need to be fired and that is extremely difficult to do when unions are involved. I used to work as a private contractor in a union environment (government) and you wouldn't believe how little work some of the unionized employees did. Unions virtually always result in a poorer level of service at a higher cost. The Canada Post management are likely doing their best, but their hands are tied because of the union. I don't think this situation is likely to change either because governments don't want to take on the unions out of fear of losing votes."
Canada Post union workers going on strike has ruined Christmas for an entire country. I along with many others will celebrate the day that all these crybabies are finally replaced with reliable robots or automated service. Striking during the holiday season has caused major delays for a nation. I hope that the postal workers realize that they dug their own grave with this one. Here's to a quick and complete downfall!
STILL WAITING FOR THE USELESS SERVICE TO DELIVER MY PASSPORT . I HAVE TO TRAVEL AND I have no idea WHEN WILL I GET MY PASSPORT BACK :(
"Wonder if anyone else has noticed that they deliberately screwed with the tracking system during the work disruption and have continued to do so : I had an Amazon shipment that went from being delayed in Ottawa one day, then at the Mississauga distribution centre the next, then back in Ottawa being delayed again the following day. Now they're doing it again, a second shipment that was 'Ready for Pickup' yesterday is 'Out for Delivery' and 'Still MIGHT arrive today'. Really sleazy behavior."
Incompetant.
Service is so trash. They've messed up my orders so many times that I've gotten immune to it now. Sometimes I don't even order products online now if they're sending them through Canada post.
Time for the government to find another company. This one can't do anything right. #christmasruined2018
Bunch of lazy greedy aholes. Canada Lost suits better to name that so called crown corporation. Worst post i ever used in my life. That bunch of losers have to b fired and new national postal service has to b established under private management..
Terrible....you suck Canada post. Waited 2 weeks for an express post delivery
"Lost important mail, generally wastes your time"
"Called Canada Post last week due to an item being delivered to the wrong address. They created a ticket service number. So I got a call today asking me about it and since everything was incorrect they told me to call the main number again. The guy told me since it had been over three days, I had to take it up with the company I ordered from. I don't get it at all when it was their screw up getting my city and postal code WAY OFF! Not impressed at all!"
Ruined my Xmas.
I guess 1 is as low as you can which is unfortunate because these bu.ms get a big fat zero. They have been trying to ship a package within Canada for over 3 weeks and cannot even figure out where it is. What a big fail.
"Wish I could give them a big fat 0!
If I could use another mail service in Canada I would! These people should be arbitrated back to work and should not receive a raise! Who else gets one now! Mail and parcels squeezed in mail slots so small you can't get them out. Mail on the ground, I picked up 6 letters yesterday on the ground around our common mail box! Can you say sabotage! Parcels today and I cannot get into the box as the key does not work. The US Postal Service is cheaper and efficient, too bad Canada's isn't. Fire them all and hire people who want to work!"
"a complete c.o.c.k. f.u.c.k.e.r.y. of a company! categorical s.h.i.t. show every last one of them that are striking should be instantly fired and replaced by competent workers that actually want to work. they have it made. big money, benefits galore, medical, dental, vacation, pension the whole shabang. i could only dream of a job like that instead im working for $14 an hour because i don't like giving blow jobs and i don't know anyone with good jobs to get me one cause we all know that's how companies and jobs work and these useless pieces of s.h.i.t. are f.u.c.k.ing up everyone life by striking. get rid of all the useless b.a.s.t.a.r.d.s. that are striking. easiest job on the planet on they are crying for more. we hope for endless rot festering and explosive diarrhea for every last one of you over paid t.w.a.t.s!"
"‚Äúunprecedented backlogs‚Äù - lol are you kidding me? This is the genius excuse from Canada post?!! News flash - This is what happens when you don‚Äôt work.

Wish I could leave 0. Worst service possible, clowns at the call centre call themesevles ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, however they can‚Äôt loctae my package. 5 agents gave me a different answer in a span of 6 days on the location of my package. Not a care in the world attitude.

Worst run corporation, greedy, and a waste of tax payer‚Äôs dollars. There has to be a way to utilize alternate carriers and Phase this debacle of a corporation out."
"If i could give negative rating I would ! Excludong the mailman and mailwoman, worthless employees that do not care about you at all. Got fu**ed over many times bythem all around Canada. Strongly disrecommend. Worst mail management i've ever seen !"
"I ordered a product from Amazon, and paid for two day delivery. As of today the item I ordered is a week late. I understand that Canada Post were on a rotating strike, but really I don't care. We all work in this country, most of us don't have the option to strike. I would definitely lose my job if I decided to do a work stoppage because I was upset. The same should happen here......fire all of them. There are plenty of people out there that would jump at the opportunity to replace them. Strategically striking right before Christmas is sickening!!! Why is the public being punished??? I'll do my best in the future to avoid using Canada Post. This was the last straw for me."
"Greedy , lazy union workers. Unreliable and a drain on our economy and budget. This service needs to be shut down immediately! Absolutely useless part of our society as all the other independent delivery companies at least try come close to the expected delivering time and they leave your packages at our door , not a notice that sais you can get your package in a couple days - at the post office. What am paying them for?"
"I get my medication sent to me by mail. It's the only option I have because of my ailments. My medication is sent at certain time intervals beyond my control. While waiting for my mail I witnessed my carrier drive right by my entire street. So I went to the office myself. The clerk wouldn't even look for my package, and told me that it might be delivered at 7 pm (when the office is closed of course). So now I'm going to be waiting another three days for meds that I needed yesterday. Thank you Canada Post for my future stay in the hospital."
"Cant leave 0 because this is how I feel about Canada post ,Pretty Bad Service been waiting on 2 packages and they are lying about the tracking . They are a nightmare when it comes to tracking packages and not giving the correct information , I am done with Canada Post the Losers they don't care about their customers . Funny how all my bills get delivered on time but not the shipments."
The Canada Post or a bunch of losers who decide to go on strike right before Christmas the ruin everyone's Christmas holidays I ordered a package for myself it said it be here on Thursday it now says on their website that they have no idea when I'll be getting the package I'm not allowed to pick up the package as I'm talking someone on trying to ignore me and don't respond to any of my messages I do not recommend ordering anything from Canada Post since there are a bunch the losers
"They SUCK! I can‚Äôt believe what nonsense they hav done.i am waiting for a package and guess what these idiotic s do,they I wan waiticlothes but they give me someone else‚Äôs this happened today and I am mad üò°. If I could give them -666666 I would cuz these dumb people don‚Äôt know how to do their job, and if the manager is reading this. FIX YOUR COMPANY! All u need to know is how to read your set. But these dumb people don‚Äôt know how to put an address in the GPS system. I just hope they give me my package. If they do I‚Äôll raise there rating by 1. So far I hate IT! HATE!"
Everytime I use canada post they screw my shipping up never use them again
"I have been waiting for package since November 17, 2018 and it was for a special event December 8, 2018. The package is still stuck in Ottawa and its been 6 days. I am clearly not going to get it in time and I don‚Äôt get my money back. I wish I never ordered this package due to the strike and the fact they are back at work but have people protesting and not letting any packages go in or out."
"Canada Post refuses to leave a 30 lbs box of cat litter valued at $12 at my door just because I live in an apartment building and my door isn't considered a ""safe delivery drop"" location. Apparently it isn't clear to them that literally nobody will steal a package that weighs 30 lbs and that is explicitly labelled as just cat litter.

If I were able to physically carry this package then I would obviously deliver it to a FlexDelivery location - but I can't! And since Canada Post only delivers during the traditional working hours of 9-5 (when I'm at work), there is absolutely nothing for me to do but refuse pickup and have the package returned to the sender every time my cat litter gets sent through them.

Thankfully every other delivery service is smart enough to leave cat litter at my door."
"Service was already bad now they're ""losing"" Amazon packages at an alarming rate. Pi**ed off at Amazon are you?"
"Was building a computer to sell for Christmas rush.
Two of the parts have not moved for weeks.
Why? People want 22$ an hour and full benefits
to put boxes in trucks. Here's an idea fire everybody
and let companies who are able to move boxes
with trucks do the job."
"What a bunch of whiny C U N T S. get back to work you lazy slobs! And get your gay supporters to get out of the way of the trucks, so they can move their packages! This is what happens when everyone becomes ‚Äúentitled‚Äù and cries like a baby when they don‚Äôt get their soother!! You don‚Äôt see me going on strike for my minimum wage job! AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. F U C K YOUR UNION! And get back to work! With the garbage service you already give us, you don‚Äôt deserve ANYTHING better then what you‚Äôre already getting! My $1,700 package better arrive safely, after waiting for such stupid, petty, childish reason as this."
"Would give zero if i could. I wont talk about the strike except to say that it ruined a lids christmas party. Ordered stuff for the party online on Nov 10 for the party. The party was on dec 1. The packages are still not delivered.
However even before the strike the service sucks. Our delivery person doesnt even try to deliver packages to our door. I have watched them fron the front door as they drop off mail only to find a pickup your parcel slip in the box. They are spoiled and useless. Have lost countless packges that i have both ordered and shipped. They need to remember that they are a service industry. I will now be paying extra to have all packges shiped privately and try to get all my important regular mail sent to me electronically. I intend to avoid the use of canad post as much as i can. There are other options. Im going on a user strike."
"Worst service ever, so yourself a favour and ship by a private company."
Horrible customer service I bought external harddrive online from bestbuy order status showed delivered but I didn't get I called 2times first one said its scan showed delivered second showed on hold because they have to verify my address then she got every information about me and told me item will deliver before 8pm but not delivered next day I call customer service rep was very rude she said she doesn't know what other rep told me and you can't call sender has to make inquiry if I have option I can give them zero star next time I will not buy anything delivered from Canada post
"Mailman who delivers my mail (and some packages) is nice, and known in my community. Gets my mail to me in time. Packages shipped with Canada post usually arrives on time, but their tracking can get confusing and delayed."
"Why would you go on strike now? I have so many orders that are in but I can't get. With Christmas, there is obviously a time limit on when I need things, and have gift exchanges even earlier, and I may have to show up with only one gift since I was unable to get anything. This is very frustrating and makes me not want to support your cause at all. If I could use harsher language in this review, I would."
"Zero star if possible!!!!

I am sure there are lots of people willing to do your job for far less."
"I would have been on the postal workers side for this strike IF THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR!
I d i o t s. Nobody likes you now."
"TERRIBLE. Get back to work you bunch of losers. You make more then 10% of us and do half the work so get me my package and STFU about it. What I pay my taxes for...? Oh did I mention that I've now waited 2 and a half months for an engagement ring that was supposed to be here in 10 days...? It's been so long, we missed the trip I was supposed to propose on, waiting on this F U C K I N G ring. Congratulations, you are officially worse then OC Transpo. I hope somebody dumps paint thinner on your vehicles."
"I used to handle my business shipping with them (15-20 parcels/week) and they would lose about 15% of them , i needed to have a special budget just for the losses I would get from lost parcels."
"I would rather give zero star. They are literally punishing customers. I ordered online which is scheduled for delivery on November 20, supposedly should be at my door in 2-3 business days every day I am waiting for it and expected delivery keep changing postponing every single day. I bought something to gift my father on his birthday I am a student I cannot afford to buy the same gift again. Waste employees, they shouldn‚Äôt accept the packages since they are going to strike instead became troublesome for all customers. Worst they should be fired. Went to strike on peak holiday season"
"My experience with Canada Post has always been fantastic and even though service has been slightly delayed, all of my packages have arrived to where they need to be in a reasonable amount of time. Every employee I come into contact with is kind and clearly enjoys their job, which is a spirit that is very much so appreciated! I wish I could tell you the name of my fantastic letter deliverer, but if you can pass along praise to the deliverer at Lennox and Euclid in Toronto, please do! Working with Sandra and Emilie is always an absolute pleasure...Keep up the fantastic work Canada Post!"
Worst company ever. They do not understand how to run a company i have made an order almost 3 weeks ago and still nothing they are unreliable.
"Worst of the worst, there is no zero star. Package should be delivered in 3 days and after around 13 days, I am still waiting for it. It is a gift and already late for what it should be."
"Doesn't attempt package delivery, just put a note with other junk mails."
"WORST COMPAGNY EVER!! I NEVER SAW A BAD SERVICE LIKE THAT.. PLEASE GOUVERNEMENT, DO SOMETHING....."
"Absolutely terrible service, using the strike as an excuse only works so long. Why has my package NOT EVEN LEFT THE PLACE IT WAS SENT FROM. This company is criminal. And dont go to Purolator because they are just as bad."
I have nothing else to say about these lazy employees.
"Expedited parcel ordered and shipped since 26th of November hasn't arrived yet. They keep pushing the delivery date forward every day. what a joke! I blame myself for choosing one day shipping at amazon checkout. Every item I have ever ordered with 2 day shipping has been delivered by Intelcom and I always get my package the very next day. Yes! you on strike! we know that, so don't accept the frigging orders. Amazon also needs to stop forwarding new orders to them coz any backlash due to their incompetency at this time will still fall back on amazon. I keep searching to click for the zero star but cant find it."
"Canada post what a joke! My parcels keep getting delayed over and over and over again, this company need to get sort their crap out or don‚Äôt be in business at all!"
I guess I might as well rely on UPS and DHL to deliver my things now. That says a lot considering how terrible they are as well. Canada post is now falling into the same rank as them.
"Strike caused 30day delay in shipping of my regular parcel.

UPDATE: 5 stars now because Canada Post has upgraded my shipping to xpresspost at no charge and the package is delivered!

Finally some relief!

I see a redemption in the near future for others still waiting... nicely done Canada Post."
"FOOOCKING TRASH !
WE OWN INTERNET BUISNESS WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ?
FOCK POST CANADA !
IF SOMEONE WANNA START A SHIPPING A COMPAGNY,IM ALL IN !"
When are we going to take the Canada out of Canada post. This circus has gone on long enough. Deliver the mail! It's time to privatize! If this is any politicians solution to this disaster I'll vote for them.
"These workers deserve to lose their jobs for good, they are making packages be late on purpose, I paid extra to have a packaged delivered during the strike and it`s still not there after over a week, I~m never going to use Canada post EVER again!!!"
Horrible. Unreliable. Untrustworthy. Slow. Useless. Had packages lost with Canada Post. Mail carrier mixed it up and it obviously ended up with someone else. Have gotten someone else‚Äôs mail far to often. Packages are often NOT attempted to be delivered at the door. Slip is often in my mailbox.... The fact that all my packages are delayed during this time of year is absolutely disgraceful. Get your stuff together Canada Post! You need to hire better staff. Pay them more if you have to. Like seriously get your stuff together!!!
People wonder why their packages never arrive on time. They sit in their little trucks on their phones feet on the dash in loading zones after done deliveries so other delivery drives cannot park. Or if you are in a loading zone and you are getting ready to leave they pull up right on your bumper to the point you cannot get out of the loading zone and make you wait till they get back to leave. Its disgraceful. And then they go on strike round christmas time. Pathetic and lazy.
"My latest item is held up in Calgary, and is to be delivered to Calgary. I paid extra for it to arrive in 1 day, and that delivery date was the 27th of November. They moved my delivery date to December 1-3 yesterday, then to the 3rd later in the day, and finally moved my delivery date to the 4th today. They won't even allow me to drive 10 minutes to get the item myself, because they need to try and deliver it at least once first, which they can't seem to do anyways. **UPDATE: Canada Post advised my item had been delivered yesterday at the ""front door"". I checked the regular spots for drop-off as our concierge does not work weekends. The item wasn't there with all the other packages from various companies like Intelcom, UPS, ... I contacted Canada Post for clarification as they didn't put a note on file regarding where my item was, and they opened an investigation. I personally spent hours yesterday with building security and caretakers, and finally located my item in a locked storage/alarm room in our lobby. This morning Canada Post emailed me saying they closed their investigation and that the item had actually not been delivered to me and could not be located by their employees. I'm currently in possession of my item. This company is a hilarious mess.**

Employees regularly strike and have labour disputes as they believe they deserve more, while I have never personally heard talk about improving service for paying clients, let alone a concerted effort to make sure their services are sufficient for their clients needs. You'd think that in Canada's current economic environment they'd realize a lot of Canadians (and their clients) are also hurting financially. They should understand that having a job with a good pension is rare in North America, especially in this economic climate and for a job that doesn't require higher education.

Running a small business, the prices charged to ship an item within the same city was higher than the cost to produce the items I sold. This is on top of the fact that we used their small business program. They need to become more competitive, especially when it comes to the livelihoods of those making their own means.

Choose another carrier, especially if your business is dependent on deliveries."
Punishing customers because you think you deserve more is counterproductive. I know I will seek alternatives in the future regardless if you settle for something. Disrupting others businesses will only open the market for someone better at reasonable cost and I‚Äôm looking forward to working with the ones who step up to fill your gap.
You should at least make the tracking accurate idgaf if it said a delay from the beginning. but being surprised everyday with an extra day of waiting just makes things worse... when things are already going horribly for you. I bet when it comes to your pay cheques you have 0 delays
"so unreliable every single day the delivery is delayed 1 more day with no progress for 5 days so far. my item shouldve arrived on the 27th (2-3 days delivery) yeah right.
now the expected date is December 5th but i guarantee tomorrow itll be delayed another day... 5 days of zero progress on the delivery. mail delivery is a big responsibility. mass inconveniences should have consequences to prevent BAD experiences like this in the future.

Update: the expected delivery date is now the 6th... lol I bet tomorrow its gonna be postponed again as im used to now... what a joke.

Update 2: The delivery date is now the 7th. But it says my parcel is in Stoney Creek. 4 days to deliver something from Stoney Creek to Niagara ??? and that's if theres no more delays which I very highly doubt! Get your s**t together actually"
"what a horrible company, this CEO should just resign for her lack of good management! I ordered some stuff for my business to sell them to my clients as this is how I make my income to pay my rent. I even payed a lot to get them delivered faster, they were supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago and every time they extend the delivery. The stuff left Winnipeg like 1 week. Is Canada Post gonna pay me my rent now? I sure think not. Fix your thing and I hope you all get back what you brought to us. Also these lame protesters had to do it on purpose during the holidays. Wow! They don't deserve anything"
"Very very bad, they don't care about customer and their work. They know there is labour disruption, still they are taking the orders from online delivery companies. And creates delay in the delivery, this clears they are irresponsible. In that case they should stop accepting the orders, once every thing is fine start accepting the order."
"Basically they will not reimburse your money when they dont meet their delivery promises for paid guaranteed services.

Since they have had a labour dispute and backlog as a result they feel it's ok to keep your money despite not honoring their delivery date policy and promise.

This is an example of what they feel about their customers and in my opinion is a form of theft, taking and keeping the monies despite providing the service advertised and paid for. Example, express post.They should be reimbursing their customers!

The dispute was between them. This is bad business, keeping the monies, and has resulted in my loss of faith in Canada Post's abilities. In the future I will not purchase items with Canada post shipping as the only option and I will be taking my business to other places such as purolator.

From their website;
""Due to unprecedented backlogs, Canada Post has suspended its delivery standard guarantees for all products until further notice. This temporary change means we will not honour claims for items that are delivered after the delivery standard date. We apologize for the inconvenience."""
"Had to wait 5 months for a birthday gift I had bought for a close family member. Thanks xpresspost, now I have to give a birthday present to someone at the end of the year."
late and very late and damage to my parcel.not good service at all.
"I am waiting for a US cheque to pay my employees for more than a month. I have to use my credit card to do that until the mail is delivered.Shame to them, will stop using their services for our small business needs."
"Canada post is very supportive and cooperative. Since last couple of days , they have been helping me to their best.i m really thankful to them for all the help they provided me during my crucial time."
"Ridiculous, holding customers property hostage. I don‚Äôt think I could get away with that at my job. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get my way I‚Äôm going to hang onto my customers belongings‚Äù Grow up you losers. If you don‚Äôt like your job, go flip burgers at McDonald‚Äôs or something more your speed."
illegally holding my goods i wonder how they would feel if we did the same i ask people to stand up and fight back to their monopoly. they are holding our money our hard earn money over their beliefs. go and try purolator and fed ex instead i will personally boycott them for a year starting now. will refuse at the door any packages from them. will let my buyers and sellers know about it . also dont be shy to tell the mail.man hes late he works for you !
"This review of Canada Post is based on their service BEFORE the strike.
The are few things you can count on Canada Post for, and one is that your delivery WILL be late. The other is that, whether you're home or not, your postman will slap a failed delivery notice on your mailbox, forcing you to go pick it up yourself. They mishandle your mail, ignore ""do not bend"" instructions and are unfriendly and unhelpful to deal with in person.
Canada Post is Canada's worst delivery service and every single Canadian feels the same way. Not a single person emphasizes with you during your strike. It is my wish to see Canada Post closed forever with another more competent company in its place. And, with the bar they set as low as it is, I'm confident literally anyone else would do a better job.
Screw you, Canada Post. You're the worst."
"Canada post is the best company for all your needs using them over 10 years never lost something canada post thank you for the best service always üëçüëçüëç
10 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
all these people are talking bad they laying
go try a other company and you will see the difference canada post are the best for all of US"
"All of you clueless people complaining about your deliveries being delayed... they are on STRIKE. They are demanding better treatment, not having to work overtime, better pay, etc. That is why your parcels aren't arriving. It's all over the news. Plus, Christmas time is the busiest time of the year."
This delivery situation is getting ridiculous. Ive ordered a lot of stuff the past week and all of it keeps getting delayed. Ive had my packages sitting in the same place for the the past week and they probly arent gna move anytime soon. If you have time to give stupid notifications every day saying ‚Äúyour parcel may be delayed‚Äù i think you can pick up the slack and actually do your job .
"Would give 0/5 if I could. Their tracker should reflect when a parcel will actually arrive, even while they are on strike."
Could have picked a better time to strike
As soon as I heard a knock on the front door I rushed downstairs to get the parcel. The post officer obviously saw me through the front door window but decided to leave because I had a 10 second delay to get on my slippers...
The current strike the union undertakes negatively impact Canada Post's integrity and reliability. The best course of action is for Canada Post to totally shut down it's operation while on strike so people will go to other courier services and get the right service for the amount they pay for. Why charge the same amount for Express Post if the delivery will not be done within the targeted timeline? You're losing integrity by charging people the same amount for the super delayed delivery due to your strike. If you can't do your service at time then better shut down your operation totally so people will go somewhere else.
Abysmal service. You want more pay? Do your job!!
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Thanks, Union."
"Honestly, I use Canada post with all my shipments personal and for work. I love supporting local because it is Canadian. But having strikes all over hasn't made it any easier for someone like myself an entrepreneur. Canada Post workers, you at least have money coming in every two weeks, you have benefits. As an entrepreneur, I have to sometimes wait 3 months before I receive a check. So please get back to work and stop complaining, I make sure I work my tail off even though I don't always receive something back. But I am happy with what I am doing if you are not happy with the work you do it's time to change jobs. Please do not let other people suffer."
My mom has a hernia and so she ordered bleach online and the driver left a card to pick at the post office with no attempt to deliver as my mother was home and watched the recording in the video doorbell. Pretty pathetic if ask me. They are a bad face for the companies they deliver for when they do that and they are not enforcing enough of the rules.
"More than a decade ago, we lived in a condo. Things were pretty bad with CP then. Here's one incident I don't forget nor forgive CP for.
I was expecting a parcel from my mother who was in Asia, battling cancer. This parcel meant a lot to us as my mother really wanted to celebrate our son's arrival but couldn't travel to Canada due to her illness.
I tracked the parcel and expected a delivery that day but only to find a card sitting in my mailbox. (no delivery attempt was made as I waited at home all day.) As a result, I was forced to push a stroller (with still a great pain from labour!!) in a harsh winter day, and pick up a huge parcel and walk back. It was so difficult, I almost cried.
Again, that was more than a decade ago but CP still has no idea how hard it is for some people to physically go out and pick up a parcel. Because of their laziness, we the customers must put ourselves thru some major inconveniences!! It seems like leaving a delivery notice without making an actual attempt to deliver has become a common practice nowadays and it's simply unacceptable.
I've given this company many chances since but feel like it has reached the end. Things are not getting any better or they are not willing to improve. It's time to say good bye for good."
...............not happy
"Opened my door last night to find a delivery notice for a package on my door, requiring me to pick it up at the post office. I was home all day, so clearly the post worker didn't want to take the time to ring the door bell to deliver the package.

Also frustrated with the government, my package was barely over $100, and I was charged $45 in duty taxes. Way to gouge government :("
"Even bigger box stores don't carry many items. I seriously hope Christmas doesn't get ruined for all of Canada.
Along with all black friday and Christmas gifts, my new phone has been held hostage for 2 weeks, since again, most stock is online and only Canada Post was offered. 2 day priority shipping eh...
Even without the strike many items would be sent back after already marked out for delivery, stating, ""cant verify address,"" because apparently there is no unit number on the mailing address. Maybe because I don't have a unit number for the 1,000,000 time!!!! If you google the address it also doesn't have a unit number. I am along a main road so its not hard to access this area in any way....
The lady I have spoken with quite a few times, when I call to complain, actually knows me right away now and gets my item back out for delivery. She is wonderful, but so far only helpful person from the company after years of this bs.
Then when the guy finally delivers the item, it's either left on the ground in the open, in the rain. Or a fake attempted delivery occurs and a notice is left. All while I watch the guy on camera walk to my door without my package I paid shipping for, with an already pre-filled attemped delivery slip.
Fire everyone from top to bottom. Wah wah walking all day with heavy lifting. Cooks, teachers, hairstylists, roofers, road workers, cold storage swampers ect all on feet 8+hours with walking and lifting, their jobs get done, making sometimes much less money.
None of you deserve any more money for your pure laziness, mail theft and horrid service. Especially with the timing of the strike I dont feel like much sympathy will be going around. Should have waited until after the New Year. Good job guys."
"Out of all the delivers I have received from Canada post over a decade:

70% of the time they are late.
10% they lie about it being delivered and it shows up days later.
10% of the time they deliver to the wrong address.
10% of the time they do a good job.

Last time I checked 10% is a failing grade, heck if any other company was that bad they would have gone out of business by now.

Everyone at canada post should be fired and the entire company should be restructured. Those incompetence morons don't deserve a single cent more."
"Garbage company and garbage employees. The day before going on the current strike, the guy never ""delivered"" my package. He filled out the notice, walked to my door, tossed it on the ground, then walked away. Now I've been waiting a week and still I can't get my package because this garbage company holds everything hostage while they strike."
I paid for express only to have my package be kept 45 min away and going on 10 days now and rising .. No strikes in the area.. not sure what there excuse would be.. This company is a joke and they need to fire all these incompetent greedy workers.
"Overpaid, selfish workers that continually hold customers hostage as they demand more and more for unskilled labour. Trained monkeys could do their jobs, yet Canada Post employees act as though they've actually EARNED the bloated salaries they make.

Completely unreliable - can't wait until this dinosaur dies at the hands of its own moronic workers who are too stupid to understand how stupid they are."
Worst mail/parcel service for years. Will never use Canada Post.
Suck it Canada Post. I'll never use your service again.
"No stars for Canada Post. Their service is nonexistent. It is impossible to reach anyone in order to solve a problem, and that is unacceptable considering their high rates.

It took four years and countless attempts to replace a red mailbox that had been vandalized. Invitations for a 50th wedding celebration and other items mysteriously disappeared.

The people we deal with at the local post office are incredibly rude, they offer no assistance and are totally useless. Canada Post employees do not deserve any sympathy. Give those jobs to others.

B. A."
"Horrible service and customer service.

They were unable to deliver and instead of contacting me with my phone or email (which was twice on the package), or notifying me to fix the problem like UPS would, they are just sending it back so now I have to pay to re ship and they won't refund either.

Using UPS whenever I finally do get it due to strike (yet again) and from now on UPS or another and never Canada Post again. Might cost more but at least you get service and results."
"After this bloody strike and the BS they have caused the entire nation, and my late and now missing parcels. I will only use fedex/ups from now on. Seriously, screw you Canada."
Worst company I've ever had the displeasure to be in contact with.
"Until the last two months I would have said canada post is the most reliable service. However, I keep getting the wrong mail in my box and deliver it to whichever neighbour, I have orders that are 30+days late, alot of orders I have tried to make recently have ridulously long delivery times or my orders are being cancelled because some companies know they too may loose if they try to fulfill the order, and my latest package has been put on the wrong truck two days in a row. I honestly believe, they timed their strike to coincide with the OCS opening its doors and that a good portion of the complaints against the OCS are on Canada post and they should also be investigated. Since that didn't work now christmas deliveries will have the same problems as many of us are already seeing. Rotating strikes definitely has nothing to do with packages and mail getting put in the wrong mailboxes, or put on the wrong trucks, or the drivers not scanning the packages in the first place when they pick them up. I get fighting for workers rights and the like, but there is a right way and a wrong way."
Ordered a gift for my sons bday.. he is not going to have it due to this damn strike been 3 weeks and everyday the delivery is pushed back....Maybe they can call and tell an 8 year old whys his bday is ruined.. I also have orders for xmas which I'm sure will not be here in time..If I was able to cancel I would..From this point on nothing I order will be threw canada post.. Thankfully there are much better carriers out there to choose from..So thanks again for ruining the holidays for everyone because of your selfishness..
Perfect time for strike! Ill tell kids that mailman ruined Chrismas. Thanks for taking presents away from families.hate it!
"Best ever express post service......gets delivered in just 15 hours evnthough its a difference province
Thank you guys....you made my day"
ordered something on amazon prime 2 weeks ago was promised for 2 days shipping every day that goes by it just says delayed to labor disruption.... this is fricken stupid af i would use a different mail service if i was given the option... even after the strike is over ill be taking my business elsewhere
"Canada post is sooo bull shITT. I ordered something on November 14 and said it will arrive in November 16, then is says its going to be delayed and is coming on November 22 Then again it says labor disruption and its going to deliver on 24 AND now it SAY DELAYED ITS GOING TO COME ON 26 LIKE WHAT THE FRIK,A ND THIS IS NOT LONG DISTANCE SHIPPING ITS, BY NEIGHBORING CITY. I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT WILL COME ON 26 AND CANADA POST BITCHH ASSS WILL KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL WHO KNOWS WHEN. I WOULD RATE IT 0 STARS IF I HAD THE OPTION EVEN -5 STARS."
"The tactics used this year by Canada Post to pressure labor talks by rotating strikes looks like it was not thought out well at all.

They have already had a PR nightmare by effectively holding its clients hostages during the busiest shipping season of the year. Which even if an agreement was done right away would still have a point of no return to service the Black Friday to Christmas season.

Also their bargaining powder will be GONE after Dec 24th. Frankly at this point, I would be glad to see that.

I am like literally thousands (if not tens of thousands or more) who have simply moved on with other options like courtiers for deliveries. the extra cost means we get it faster, and do not have to deal with being pawns in Canada Posts game. Ill always use other options from now on.

It is not the turn of the 20th Century, Unions are more irrelevant each Canada Post is ensuring that trend continues as it basically shows its customers it does not care.

The fat cats at the top of this union clearly do not understand what their industry is doing now, and how they have only business to lose with this strike. Business that even without strike needed an overhaul in how they handled it."
"As of writing this, I have been informed that my parcels coming from Japan are being turned back due to the severity of the Canada Post strike and it's ""historic"" backlog of parcels at the moment.

I hope the Canadian government stays true to it's word and imposes back to work legislation as soon as possible - forcing these undeserving, incompetent and shameless Union workers to end their strike immediately; just as the Canadian government has done so for decades.

To the Union workers currently striking: I hope each and every one of you gets fired for hurting my (and so many other Canadian's) mail delivery. If you don't like your jobs - quit and be replaced by employees that will value your positions more than you ever have. It's that simple.

The joke has gone on long enough. Now hurry up and get back to delivering my mail in all of your half-@ssed glory."
"I've lived at my building for the last 3 years. I've had about 6 parcels delivered. Of those 2 where left outside my door apparently and went missing completely and 1 package the postal worker left a tag on my door without knocking. I had to open my door and run down the stairs after him. When I caught him he said in such a haughty tone ""oh... so you are home... I'll be right back with the package in a few minutes"" and then drove @#$! Off.
So now you're asking for a pay raise even being so inconsistent. If you hate your job and don't want to do it I'm sure there are plenty of qualified people who need those jobs who can take your place.

Unions are not the answer. They only hurt normal people and keep the worst type of unemployable people in positions that they shouldn't be."
"My daughter sent me a package from Calgary to Victoria, with four day guarantee. When it did not arrive on time she checked and the package was sent to REDDEER Alberta. Was redirected and now they are not sure were it is! When my daughter ask for a refund she was to no because of the strike. Why did they take her money in the first place if they could NOT guarantee the four day delivery!
Worst company service ever. They should be ashamed of the customer service provide!"
"Wow. Just called Canada Post toll free number. I wanted to know if the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) cheques were going to be delayed November 2018 due to the strike. I got a VERY nasty lady at Canada Post Customer Service. I told her the CRA and Canada Post have made an arrangement to ensure the CCB cheques are delivered. I wanted to know why I have not received my cheque and told her I had just spoken to the CRA and my cheque WAS issued and supposed to be delivered, as per the above mentioned agreement between the two. The Canada Post Rep had NO idea and told me to contact the CRA, after I JUST told her all of the above and that I had just talked to the CRA. The Rep was of NO help, had no idea, nor was going to bother to try and find out. She was snarky and rude. Kinda scary that Canada Post's agents representing them, know less than the customers. Thanks for nothing, Canada Post!"
You guys are trash. You get treated better than most work places anywhere yet all you want to do is complain and strike so people don't get their stuff and hold it hostage. It could be a lot worse than working for the post office... TONS of people would kill to work for Canada Post. Grow up.
"I am writing in behalf of My room mate . He is so stressed about delays in his parcels no thanks to this current Canada post strike. I don‚Äôt understand how some Canada post employees have the audacity to ask for a raise when most parcels go missing , stolen and/or get undelivered. My co workers also mentioned about having to drive far to inconvenient locations just to pick up their parcels. Stop this non sense and get back to work please. The Canadian government should replace those whiny immature Canada post people with immigrants who really want the job without complaining."
Screw Canada Post! You will never have the population sympathy doing like you do! Small business has been deeply and negatively impacted! families with very limited budget (poor) for Christmas won't receive their gifts because of you! You are terrible...
Don't throw snowballs at me guys. I feel your pain believe me. One main complaint they have is safety. Some have been accosted physically by people wanting their dope more than anything and they want it NOW. If you dont have Your ID. You dont get. Canada post got the contract for delivering your dope and they will fight back. To protect your delivery. That is one issue. Another is. Working 12 hours and getting paid for.8. Remember if those of you want your dope that bad have your ID ready. And dont touch the mailman. Its cold out there. My mailman is great. Theyre all doing their best.
Absolute garbage. The disaster that you have caused for my business will not be forgotten or forgiven. I would gladly support any other courier than CP. F U guys
"What a joke this strike is. My business relies on my items being purchased. I called in to even offer to pick up my items that i paid for. Their response..... i am not allowed. How does that even make sense, I have paid for an item that is MINE but yet they can hold it hostage. People should have the option of getting their stuff if their drivers are on strike. Shame on C-post for this unacceptable experience."
"I ordered a package on Nov 3rd and shocker its till at the distribution center that it came into Canada at. At this rate I want to drive down and go through the trucks that are holding my package. Screw Canada Post and their union! They are acting like children and throwing tantrums for every little thing they dislike about their job. News flash... life isn't always fair and every job has bad aspects. Grow up. If they want to change the way their company is run how about doing it in a way that doesn't screw over the economy and punish all Canadians. Don't get me started about Christmas. ""Merry Chrismas....Santa got you a gift and it will gets here in the next month or two."" Mmm feel the holiday spirit!"
"Canada Post is the worst courier on earth, fire them all and get new employees and end the union, its 2019 already for god's sake!"
"Terrible company,

Paid 20$ for a Xpresspost delivery 3 days guarantee.. now been 16 days and still not deliver. They won't refund me for a late delivery claim."
"Over priced, poor and unreliable service. I am a small business in Canada and I have to stick with Canada Post as I do not have sufficient volume for a discount with FeDex or UPS. I would rather close down my business then to use Canada Post. Forget about online shopping this season, donate your money to local charity like food bank to help those people in need or buy locally from you mall to support your community rather than spending you money on shipping with these crooks. BAN Canada Post !!!"
"This is the WORST and most IRRESPONSIBLE company on the planet. It should be illegal to go on strike as often as they do. People rely on a functional mail service to receive extremely valuable information, that simply does not get delivered because of their lack of care and work ethic. These cry babies go on strike EVERY YEAR. If you dont like the job, QUIT!!!!! For the sake of the people that rely on their mail, you need to QUIT and find your self a job where you will not cry and go on strike."
"why canada post is still in business?
Stop supporting them!!!! They dont deserve it !!!!!
let the fair market decide whom to stay!

never ever use canada post ever again!

took the money for emergency delivery service paid the top dollars to ensure timely fashion, but guess what??? lost contract and lost business just because of stupid strike!!"
"5 days now Canada post has been holding my package hostage I paid for express 2 to 3 day delivery, impossible to get ahold of anyone to file a complaint."
I don‚Äôt like post office and your union rep decides if the employees should vote on a contract. Contract seemed good to me but I don‚Äôt get double time and I work 7 days a week and I don‚Äôt get overtime till 44hrs
THEY DONT EVEN DESERVE A STAR. They are months late on my 6 packages all worth a lot of my hard worked for money. IF THEY ARE LOST I AM SUING THEM! do not use that company
I always get my packages or package notices and appreciate the service so far. Way better than all other delivery companies in my honest opinion!
"Stolen package, waiting home all day because package was out for delivery and nobody rang or knocked on the door I went back to see the status of my package and it said it was delivered I went Outside and no package was there . The package was a necklace small enough to put in the mail box I live at the same place for 25 years and I got thousands of packages from different carrier and never had a problem I live in a peaceful neighborhood with old people so definitely got stolen by the delivery man himself."
"I ordered my item on tuesday and with xpress shipping was supposed to arrive on friday, its now friday and they said itll be here tuesday even though its in a facility 30 minutes from my house. Instead of being able to go pick it up i have to wait 4 days. Express delivery is a lie never will i order with canada post again. Your strike is your problem, dont like your job then quit. You lazy POS will never ship my stuff again i wish i could give no stars and spit in your faces."
"there is one time I got notice from canada post said my pacakge already delivered with a tracking number. but I did not got anything. they actrually delivered it one day later. that cause the seller thought I try to lie to them.
If I can, I will never ever use canada post. hope some other company able to replace canada post.
Just shut the fk useless canada post right away."
"I will avoid Canada post like the plague for the rest of my life. They are the worst postal service I have ever seen.

I had confirmed my address 3 times for a package from Langley to Vancouver. Canada post told me I provided incorrect information. I confirmed this was not true and even confirmed with them over the phone.

They still blamed me. Their customer service took no action. A friend was forced to return and pick up the package without it being delivered.

Two months later my friend delivered it to my place directly. Canada post can‚Äôt even deliver within lower mainland because they are arrogant and lazy.

I laugh when they strike, what is the difference nothing gets delivered anyway.

They blame customers!"
Told you guys a million times to deliver it at the front door not the community mail box and none of your deliveries are made on time
"Their chat online system is a joke. I wonder if other people had the same experience as me. Read the convo below (keep in mind I waited patiently to get my answer) Also I gave my actual info but had to keep this confidential:

Canada Post"
This monopoly is destroying the credit of Canadian postal service in general. I will never use them personally.
"Constantly mess up the delivery of my parcels and then lie about nobody being home to receive them. Already garbage service before the strike, basically non-existant service now... Took 2 weeks to deliver an Xpress Post parcel which is ""guaranteed"" 2 day delivery.

Abolish and replace with private-sector model and watch how quickly mail service improves when these greedy, over-paid dummies can actually be fired for their incompetence."
Canada post is no good. Trust me guys they are selfish people that do not give two cents about your packages please avoid them. federal. Never ever doing business with them again
hey let's take off Monday for a non stat holiday then strike the next two days. 3 times you have changed my delivery time without a word. 28 days still no delivery. I hope you all get the same f*** you that you have given all the people awaiting packages
"Sent marketing packages expedited delivery as we do weekly. We get electronic notification of delivery date and time, plus who signed. Not on those mailed Oct 22 however. We have yet (Nov 14) to get any notification. Went to postal outlet where mailed from. Checked tracking numbers and told they were never scanned. Called techie dep't and told power outages Oct 19-22. Called Canada Post for reimbursement. Rep told me she couldn't do that. Asked to speak with supervisor. Told I'd get a call back within 4 hours. 6 hours later I call back: told there's a note on file from supervisor that they need the tracking numbers ( no call to me, and no effort to call their techie dep't who have these numbers already). Give numbers again, offered reimbursement, but not on my credit card on which they were charged: they're sending a check, wait for it.......by mail!! Now that's customer service. Been using this service for years, but switched this past Monday to Canpar: slightly cheaper and more customer focussed than the people's mailer."
"The only postal company I know that refuses to do their job.
I've been waiting 2.5 months for a package, which will now be further delayed due to the strike. My packages are always late if they arrive at all.

Being a mail delivery boy shouldn't be a career, it should be something kids in high school who have no skills do for extra cash. Making over $25 a hour delivering mail is silly. I hope the government breaks up this monopoly so I can use any other shipping company to deliver mail without being subject to $25 minimum mail fees.

If it was up to me, I would fire them all, mail would be delayed for a few months, but it would be worth it."
"I hope you get nothing in your demands. My husbands company had to take a rollback of $800 a month , just so they could keep their jobs. And I know they work harder then any of you lazy bunch. Be happy you got a job and get back to work. I am going to make sure that I use CP as little as possible when this strike is over, so that will have to get rid of more of you.Here are somethings that you can do,get all your bills online, do not send out birthday and Christmas cards use other delivery methods. We need to show this company that we are serious and maybe then they stop holding us hostage to their demands.This is crazy, they are well paid, have good benifits and pensions and they still want more.Enough is enough."
Not impressed with this so call strike. They never deliver your package but they will leave a notice saying they tried even thou someone is at home all the time. Overpaid for poor quality of service. I don't feel sorry for the canada post employees. Time to get back to work.
Is it true they are going on strike for better salary? Did they even do their job? Oh no they don‚Äôt deserve it‚Äôs always late and one day i was supposed to receive an important letter and it showed ‚Äòout for delivery‚Äô and it turned out they send it to the other city. I was so happy. I wish canada post would disappear on earth and ups or fedex take over them
Takes a long time to deliver items. I ordered online it took one week to arrive from China to Mississauga Ontario but it is almost 3 weeks processing time in Canada post. Final destination is North York Ontario just 30 minutes driving to Mississauga.
Showing inacurate tracking information says is out for delivery but the mails been here already and nothing so will just file a claim with the sender
Terrible and disgusting experience. How long you will take this issue without acknowledging. Shame on all who works for the Canada post. Shut down and let the people who knows business do it.
I cannot get my proper pain and anxiety meds anywhere other than online. I‚Äôm ready to jump out of my skin. Does Canada Post care about their customers? I guess not.
Disgusting. You are going to take Canada Post down with you. Greedy little people.
Why do you guys need to affect your own customers? My package was sent to my home area for inspection and then sent to a further processing plant to be processed again!? WHY DIDNT U JUST SEND IT TO MY HOUSE WHEN YOU WERE IN THE AREA!!! how many times is it going to in process w t f ?!
"Second parcel being received in a 2 weeks with xpress post when it normally takes 2 days.

Why am I being impacted by the strike ,im a paying costumer im not your employer."
"Seriously, I understand getting screwed by corporate, but passing that on to people who have paid to have an important parcel delivered for a important timeframe is not a way to garner sympathy from the masses. Your company sucks and it had screwed my business over for the last time. I wish your company all the worst in the coming years."
"I went to a local post office in a very small town of Postville, NL. I was expecting a parcel and I saw that a bunch of parcels being delivered to the post office so I waited a while and then went down to see if my parcel was one of them. I was told by the postal clerk that the mail would not be ready for pickup before closing time. I went home again and about an hour later I checked the tracking web page on the Canada Post web site and discovered that 3 minutes after I left the post office the parcel I was expecting was ready for pickup! But now it is too late to pick it up because the post office is closed. The postal worker knew who I was and knew that I wanted to get the parcel as soon as because I phoned a couple times during the previous days to see if it was in the post office yet. This was on a Friday before a long weekend so now my parcel will be sitting in the post office for 4 more days before I can get it. This is definitely the last time I will use Canada Post to ship anything to Postville. From now on I will be using a courier and air cargo service to ship things here (this is a fly in community in the winter). Also I don't want to have to deal that local postal clerk because I don't like her demeanor. I am not from this community so I am still considered an outsider even though I've been living here for over 2 years. Maybe this explains her attitude towards me."
"Minimum wage workers are more deserving. All minimum wage workers should seriously consider going on strike. Canada Post does not have justifiable reasons to go on strike. Canada Post jobs are easy compared to back breaking, hard and stressful minimum wage jobs. Canada needs a new postal delivery service. Mr. Trudeau should act ""right now"" to end the Postal Strike."
"before i use to get a package from them and i use to get buzz from downstairs so i can go down and pick it up, if the package did not get delivered due to me not being home they would leave a notice and usually i would be able to get them to re-deliver after speaking to them, now they don't ring you at all they just come to you to give the delivery notice meaning they just leave it in your mailbox and you have to go pick it up, the whole point of getting something delivered is so that it comes to you instead of the other way around so now they want you to think that that's how it is i called over 5 people and they all had and attitude and said the something, they don't ring to come to your door, they won't ring you to come down because apparently it takes to much time ?? may i remind you they always have came up or buzz me, also some packages could fit in the mailbox yet they don't put it in is almost like is on purpose and they want to be annoying .. USE ANOTHER COMPANY IF THIS IS THE ONLY OPTION THEN DON'T this will make them appreciate their customers more"
Completely useless. They dont even knock on the door or ring the door bell. I received a package while at home the entire day. They just left the package in the rain. And they want to get paid more. Try to do your job properly morons before you ask for more money
"Kamloops, Dalhousie Drive
I wanted to recieve my meds but I came here on Thursday just to see people who don't want to work. Delivery company doesn't want to care about customers nor about employees.
10 people outside. Who the hell you want to make worse company or customers?
What if it was an old lady instead of me, who made her early morning cold hour trip to the PostOffice to hear ""come back tomorrow""? 0 care, 0 responsibility.
Also I came back on the next day when they asked to come back tomorrow. Nobody wants to work at all. I wish their doctors and banks will refuse to work when they need to."
Garbage employees they are already overpaid and they go on strike every two years asking for more. Delaying everything for everyone. They're just a bunch of crybabies. The company should just ask their competitors to deliver the delayed packages and pay them the fees they got from us. Everyone should stop using canada post so their employees will pay the price by losing jobs because the company wouldn't do enough money to keep them all. That would teach them a lesson.
"The worst ever delivery in my lifetime! I can‚Äôt imagine how slow it is,i‚Äôve been waiting for my parcel since oct 30! And now it doesn‚Äôt even have a tracking number!"
"Buy most things online. Hate when the shipper is canada post. I've paid for 2 day shipping many times - dozens in fact - and only received ONCE on time. Hate using them. Now they are on rotating strikes, they still let you pay, but my tracking now says another week. Ugh."
"One of the most crucial criteria for a post carrier to succeed is to meet the obligation of each delivery at their best effort instead of coming up with a bunch a excuses and delaying the delivery date again and again, and displaying ""Item processed"" on the tracking page for one f**king week, which is exactly what I am currently experiencing with Canada Post. And most ironically, they still go on strike and demand higher salary. As a matter of fact, one company will only thrive when they show real care to their shareholders, which is seemly unreachable for Canada Post, and that will surely indicate their downfall."
"The worst delivery service. They keep charging us hidden fees using an excuse that it is volumetric weight. If that is the case then how come the Canada post website didn't estimate my volumetric weight when they issued a waybill to us. it's all a bunch of B.S. They also cancel pick ups because of the strike and don't inform anyone so you're sitting here waiting for them to arrive and they never do. You call in and they tell you they won't call you to let you know when it is rescheduled, you have to call in. Who has time to operate their business like this? Not to mention they are super expensive!"
"Don't send anything Canada Post with these rotating strikes. Everyday my 7 day shipment get pushed out. My 7 day shipment is now a 21 day shipment with no form delivery date provided. Every day Canada post change the dates. Use FedEx or UPS . Purolator just as bad as Canada post.

If you want you loved ones to get gift do not send Canada Post"
It's so stupid. I've been going crazy waiting 35 minutes in a call saying i have to do a new label for my parcel since i didn't print it within 5 days like they haven't mention anything about it. Like the site is so bad and not done properly you're confuse and the information you need is not even there. I was searching for 3 hours on this shittysitw since the personS on the phone didn't know what to do. CANADA POST IS DUMB REtRDED INDEED.
"If i could give a 0 i would. My mother sent me a package for my 30th Birthday right before she went in for a very invasive surgery today, not knowing whether or not she was going to make it out (we are just praying), and was given a tracking number of which she passed onto me. I followed the package and they said it was delivered to M4G 1Z4 when the address on the actual package itself said N5Y 1V7. Would someone please explain to me how the hell a package CLEARLY stating LONDON ONTARIO ended up in f***ing Toronto Ontario??? Canada post is full of ID***S! Useless ID***S! Don't these f***ing ID***S, i have never once had a package delivered on time even after paying extra for it, end up where i was sending it to. Get your s*** together Canada post! You have one f***ing job! ....why the f*** you do you guys feel you're entitled to more money/benefits when you cant do something as simple as deliver a god damn package to the proper address???"
I feel that Canada post employes don't give a dam about the mail there suppose to be taking care of they just like tyo cry when they don't get what they want !
Canada post goes on strike bi yearly. The employees don't even actually deliver parcels. I've seen them walk to the door and leave a note with no actual attempt at delivery. Not a single employer or employee cares about the customer. How this group of people can call themselves Canadian is beyond me. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible human beings.
Awful awful awful. Can we get drones or robots to do their jobs more efficiently? Human error gets in the way of everything.
It has been on going issue with my mail getting delivered to wrong address or I get the mail for other people.i tried to complaint but no result and the post office manager very rude
"All these delays are very disappointing right now. I am waiting for some urgent packages and these lazy pansies think its ok to strike? Things weren't that great before either, maybe after this things will improve"
"Always a bad experience, postman never called my door, he leave delivery notice without filling it up (date/time) to pick up the item, and customer service can't do anything about that.
So, you waste your time and your money and have to go to postal office to pick up your item. But remember your delivery notice is empty so first you need to call them to figure out where and when to go ... hilarious.
Worse company ever."
"These clowns lose every other package I send, and cram any packages I receive so tight in the mailbox that I can't take it out without damaging the item, and to boot they go on strike annually in hopes to be paid more for their awful service. They clearly hate their jobs and spite the people they are paid to deliver to. They really don't deserve the compensation they are demanding, in my opinion."
"Excellent ‚Äì no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
Horrible interface with no option to change address permanently. I only keep getting redirected to temporary address change.
"Delivery is slow. Avoid using them, prefer DHL."
"shipping takes forever, and gets pushed back multiple times"
"The worst shipping service in the whole entire planet
if you can evan call that terrible peaple"
"Get rid of Canada post!! Solution for all employees, walk off the job. Put out some resumes for new positions elsewhere and F*** off......."
"This is only one of many issues I have been having with Canada Post. Not only this time my package, with my address on it, was sent to another house down the street with an odd ending number, (other side) my andress is an even number, but was also open by the home owner, luckily it was my motorcycle stand, to which he had no purpose using, and returned it to me. I also had to pay $14.27 duty on a T shirt, how in the world, is a t shirt, let alone, not even worth $15, and forced to pay such a high duty for?? Another one of my packages of wine corks, was missing many corks, due to the negligence of handling and my package was destroyed. I also received many tin signs that are badly bend and dented, to the point were it looked like bacon. I‚Äôm honestly sick and tired of the lack of professionalism, reliability, responsibility and respect the Canada Post, has for its customers.

It‚Äôs funny at the end of the day, they want more, better pay, better benefits, more coverage, easier jobs. Why don‚Äôt we just get rid of everyone and start new? I think it‚Äôs quite obvious, Canada Post is greatly lacking, and they need to make some soon, before the inconsiderate employees destroy what‚Äôs left of their company."
Do youre fcking jobs like the rest of us you lazy fuccks some of us have things that needs to be delivered this should be fcking illegal ya goofs
"Canada Post employees ... seriously... going on strike on a nearly annual basis has made your union look like a joke ... and employees look like a bunch of entitled whiners.

I had a tracked my renewed Passport, which I had requested be sent by Xpresspost (which advertises ‚Äò2 Day Delivery Guaranteed * ‚Äô)
My renewal - which is required for my work, as I work in a specialized trade internationally - was issued by Passort Canada with their normal processing time, and delivered to Canada Post on October 23rd.
One would expect that 2 days, from the 23rd, delivery would be on the 25th. No ... not at all ... the passport arrived on the 31st.
One more day late, would‚Äôve cost me my next contract. Needless stress, thanks to Canada Post‚Äôs continuing failures.

XPRESSPOST 7 DAYS LATE?

Strike or no strike - I vow to NEVER use Canada Post service again.
(I will avoid supporting the service in every way possible)

And don‚Äôt forget ... Canada Post is not a national asset by any means.
Its a massive tax liability. Citizens like us pay for their short-comings twice... in taxes ... and also when we pay for the continually failing service.

I will be happy to support private shipping services, which I my experience, have never let me down. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to actually get the service they paid for - and not even worry that they won‚Äôt?"
"My local delivery guy is great.
My review does not reflect my home service.
What bothers me is that i was looking at my tracking and within 10 minutes.
My package went from saying ""will be delivered on the first"" to ""the second""
My package has my epilepsy medication inside of it. And these morons who are on strike are preventing me from getting my medication...
Thats messed up."
Terrible. Every package I have ever gotten was late or delayed. Today I was told my package would be arriving hopfully today (not my original date) so I sat and waiting my front door was no more then 10 feet away. I sat there watching tv with the windows partly opened I was even outside for a bit throwing garbage out and such. I come inside sit down for no more then 10 minutes I check my delivery status and it says notice left I open my door to find a notice left with crayon crew instructions. First of all the guy probably didnt knock at all. Secondly he could see lights on and ours cars there and me sitting there physically watching tv. So I read the notice to it saying pick it up after 1. I figure ok not much of a problem I'm off work today no worries. I get there to shoppers drug mart to them telling me oh no they are supposed to write tomorrow at 1 they have not been doing that for anyone packages.......... like who are they hiring . And they are striking for more money yet they get the window lickers running the show. Horrible service any other service for mail is better.
"My contacts were shipped out on Oct 22nd. I paid for Priority Shipping that's a joke. The Tracking said they will be delivered Thur 25 then, they changed it to Fri 26. Its now Wed 31. Tracking Hasn't even been updated since Fri. For reference to get to my house always takes 2 business days from Missisauga that's its. My package is still there in Missauga 9 days later.

My Halloween is screwed now because I can't see. If I would of chosen Fed Ex I would of had my package by last Wed.

I even thought about doing a reorder and choosing a different shipping company but my package was already $150.00. Its not fair that I should even have to. So I've decided I am never going to choose Canada Post again if I have a choice. You shouldn't take peoples money for shipping if your not going to actually deliver their product. Also last Xmas I paid $40.00 shipping cause Canada Post guaranteed a delivery by xmas eve. Nope it didn't come till January.

I always order lots of stuff online and Purolator, Fed Ex and U.P.S ALWAYS show when they say they will. You can count on them. Canada Post never shows and its time for them to go. They cannot be relied upon."
"This situation is going way too far, second time I order the same item because Post Canada shipped back to sender the 1rst time ""wrong address"" while my address was correct, and now I buy the same product with Express shipping because I really need it before Wednesday and today I got and email saying that my parcel will be delayed 7 BUSSINESS DAYS!!! This is unacceptable, they want to be payed more but they don't do their Job correctly! I sincerely hope I will get my parcel before the end of the week. It has been 3 weeks already....üò°üò°üò°"
"One star is actually way too much for this joke of a company. I dealt more than enough with them for the last couple years. I‚Äôm done! For now on i will do everything i can to avoid using their services (or lack there is) and actually give my money to people who at least pretend to care about customer service. It‚Äôs always problem after problem, delivery guy not even attempting to deliver parcel at home and just bring the card ( if im lucky enough to get a card ) while i watch them do it from my home, delivery is without a doubt always late even if you pay premium price, mail man throwing mail over the fence so its left all over the place in the rain, parcel lost, card filled out to pick up parcel on saturday after 13h but the women at the counter is telling me that they dont receive mail on saturday and why i ask why the card say to pick up thst day, she says that they always do that...i guess somebody should start doing they‚Äôre job properly!
And on top of that they are on strike! For what?? To get better benefice?? In order to have the right to strike you actually have to work and provide a service which they absolutely dont! They dont care about customers, the only time things goes according to plan with Canada Post is when you swipe your card to pay their overprice fee
Im so done! They are lazy, dont know their jobs, and nobody seems to be hold accountable.,,
As a canadian, i am utterly ashamed to call this company my national mail service...
They should all be fired and then start fresh maybe then we would get what we pay for."
"So wait, why have a delivery standard date, ""a delivery commitment date"", If they just extend the date everyday?? My parcel axis it would be here last Monday, the standard delivery date has been extended every day for a week now. Also the package is in mississauga, I'm in windsor, only 3 hours away. It has taken a week and I haven't received my package that is only 3 hours away. Is this a joke?"
"I thought purolator (puro- later) was pathetic - no shock Canada Post is of the same low quality and standards. Canada Post wants to strike? for more money? you can't do the proper job correctly now smh - Your tracking service is a complete joke - Sadly it is not the fault of the workers, it is the higher up suit and tie guys that need to be replaced as they give Canada a bad name."
"The worst and slowest Postal Service I've ever had the misfortune of using.
Do yourself a favor and use any other options available."
"The online tracking, self help, and tips online work well since it's easy to navigate. I enjoy having the option to be notified via text or email if a parcel/notice was left in the mailbox. Customer services are attentive and provided information when I needed it and their staff who deliver the local mail are always friendly."
"My package was lost. I called to get this sorted out and the first employee was useless and simply repeated the tracking/shipping information (as if I didn't already know). I asked to speak to a supervisor because he could do nothing for me. TRISHA was very rude and condescending, asking if I knew how to use the internet to track a package! I'm pretty sure I know more than you do if I'm looking at it RIGHT NOW and you can't even tell me the same information I'm seeing! When asked to escalate even further, TRISHA refused, then I asked for her employee number and she HUNG UP ON ME! Never in my 20 years of working in customer service have I witnessed this! THIS IS GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL!"
"These lame postal workers who are on strike now should give their head a shake. Every single person I know rates Canada post as deplorable in the service area and a strike will not improve this perception. As service is really the only thing they offer, one star is too much. I really hope they lose a lot more customers to couriers and consequently more of the whining employees will become redundant and unemployed."
"The delivery people are terrible I live in the densest neighbourhood of Canada and have lost mail due to be delivered to the wrong apartment I assume due to the amount of mail I get for a different building or floor.

I switched to their Flexdelivery service and that works as long as the post office staff remember to scan it when parcels gets there."
"Use FedEx or Puralator, it's worth the little bit extra money. Canada Post is a scam, just a cash grab for the government. They don't give a sh!t about their customers."
"Canada post has not ever done a good job, Canada post is the most poorly executed system ive ever had the displeasure of working with and we don't even have other options in some cases. A small boy delivers penny savers in my neighborhood and I always get those, but Canada post cant maintain a delivery standard and theyre only answer is ""Oh sorry about this well move the delivery standard back"" I hope the strikes go poorly, why would anyone pay someone more money to do a terrible job."
"Worst delivery carrier ever. Every time I make an online purchase, I'd cringe when I know the delivery carrier is Canada post. Here are my reasons :
1)they are the only delivery service that refuse to deliver to your door even though you buzz them into the building twice. They reason that they have no obligation to do so. Then why are they the only one who doesn't and why do you buzz the doorbell?
2)today they decided to deliver my package to a pickup location that is much further away from my house when there is a Canada post pick up location 200meter from my house. This location is sooooo shady that I wouldn't dare to walk there alone without fear of being robbed."
"Someone tell my why this federally ran company has not been removed and replaced with a better option ? I frequently use Canada post express post for my Job and they have yet in 3 years to make their ""deadlines of 1-2 days and it always turns into 1-2 business days. Want to wait a over a week to receive a parcel in the same province, ? the $20 extra I always pay for the xpress so it NEVER arrives on time, and customer service seems appologetic enough but constantly complains how those dates are just ""guides""."
"Let someone else do the job if you dont want to. Dont lie to people about how important our parcels are to your company, because all of Canada can see all you care about is lining your pockets. Canada Post always wants to strike for more money, yet cannot tell apart sender from receiver, deliver a package to a door (yes, I live in a house) or take accountability for their mistakes. The customer service is not useful as they tell you whatever you want to hear then they don't follow up with actions - its basically in one ear and out the other. Its time for a change."
"Horrible
I‚Äôve ordered many things from amazon and they have all arrived on time (or earlier) with other carriers. Every time something gets sent by Canada Post it is late! It‚Äôs very frustrating especially when you pay for it to come on time. Now that it‚Äôs the weekend I have to wait two more days for something that should have come today. Very disappointing! I really don‚Äôt like Canada Post :("
"Terrible timings


I am so unbelievably upset. The amount of times that I have gotten something in the mail as returned postage or a late letter that leaves me with a day to figure out how to pay 400$ is unexceptable. Ive lost jobs because of how long things take to get to me and for something as simple as a lack of postage."
"This the 4th time a small parcel was to be delivered over the last couple years. Each time the tracking states card left for pick up at the post office no one home. But each time I was home and I watched them drive directly to the postal boxes. Even when I check the postal box there is no tag there nor did they stop at the house. The postal worker state online ""tag left"" . Total lie. As far as my thoughts go ...the system is abused by its employees...time for an overhaul ...strike forever for all I care...I will not use Canada post if there are other options"
"Took 20 days to deliver a letter from Ontario to BC, and I was expecting some letters which was sent out by the company around 30 days ago, but I haven't receive them. I am wondering if Canada Post is still working????????!!!"
"I think there is something wrong with Canadians in general.
Two Months expected delivery time from Canada to UK...there Postal service is primitive and nobody seems to care!!!!"
"I have lived in many countries and Canada Post is by far the worst postal service of them all! The others are so far ahead they think they are behind!
LAZY delivery people who never deliver packages. I work from home and watch them as they leave a card in the mailbox. Truly unbelievable.
Post a letter or package in the U.K in the morning, and it will arrive in the afternoon post the same day.
Perhaps they should spend more time upgrading their service instead of wasting time and money coming up with ridiculous new stamps every year."
"They don't know what they are doing. They cannot deliver a package that has no address error, because they are just incompetent. They can't even fix it because they even don't know how to listen. All their customer representatives and supervisors should learn at least to listen before answering and they should at least do what they say. I have never seen such a group of arrogant incompetent people. I will definitely look at alternative options all the time. Incorrect, rude, liars all the ingredient for a company to go bankrupt in these moderns days. Taking a 200$ fee to deliver in France and you even can do your job. pitty"
I always wait for packages at home but they just leave delivery notice in our mailbox then take them to pickup location even without attempt to deliver. Its so frustrating!!!
"Drivers are Lazy! Twice (so far) I've ordered 'large' items, and they wouldn't deliver it to my door, they just drop it off at a facility nearby and make me pick it up, which is inconvenient since I am a student living in downtown Toronto WITHOUT a car. Sometimes they'll bring the item to your door, sometimes they'll just leave a notice in your mailbox. And no, it's not because I'm not home. I have a concierge who is in charge of packages and would've called if my item was brought into the building. It's very inconsistent. So, so lazy."
"They blame the sender for a mistake in their system. I want my package and they decided to send it back to the sender without any clarification because they didn‚Äôt have my address in their system. I called days before to let them know of the issue and they wrote down my address yet it still gets sent back. Take responsibility for you actions, quit blaming other. Company sucks"
Canada Post is very lucky I'M EVEN GIVING THEM A ONE STAR. I would rate them 0 if I could. Very bad customer service! I have been waiting on the line for 45 minutes now. I would suggest for everyone who works there to take a 'Customer Service' courses at Red River College or else fire them straight up. This is bs
Do not use Canada Post! This company is a joke
If you could use anything else do so. Eveytime I use Canada post it comes 2 days late even when I request express post or priority. They also never knock on the door so I have to go to the post office just to grab my package. I have 2 dogs and someone is always home. Canada post doesn‚Äôt care or even try
"Canada Post has admitted they cannot find a package I mailed months ago. They have confirmed the records indicate it NEVER LEFT the postal outlet. They confirmed the recipient did not receive the package. They then closed the claim case with a ‚ÄúWe appreciate your business and apologize for any inconvenience you may have been caused‚Äù email.

I can accept I did not buy the insurance so they will not pay for the lost item but they did not even offer to refund the $14.91 in postage fees that I paid to have it mailed.

They did not fulfill their part of the non-verbal contract entered into when the item was posted and I paid for delivery. To me that is now blatantly straight out stealing from me.

I will now boycot Canada Post and recommend to everyone I know to as well. I will gladly pay more for delivery companies to move everything I ever want to ship again.

Had they offered to refund my postal fee I would have been content as the cost of the item was not significant.

SHAME CANADA POST.

I am going to post this on Canada Post every day."
Absolutely lousy service. 90% of the time i had to deal with Canada post it is extremely frustrating. They have the most illogical policies. They rather spend money to send multiple notices to a mail recipient to pick up the post instead of re delivering the item. And they rather spend the money to return the mail to sender halfway round the world than to redirect the mail. No wonder it is losing money.
Absolutely garbage company. Tracking numbers dont work. My package is 3 days late. Think you could talk to someone on the phone lol nope. Waited 2 hrs online to talk to someone and when I did they are late delivering mail cause of the cm of snow we got haha. Canda post is the absolute worst bunch of lazy goofs. You guys dont deserve any more money for a wage cause you all suck
The worst company i have ever dealt with. not only for its crappy employee conduct with delivering mail but how they treat their costumers. was referred to do mail forwarding online as it would be better and less hassle to have it take my money and not preform the service promised. then to be told by a employee that they personally suggest we go in to apply. had to talk with 4 people who all tell me that they have nothing to do with the system not working that its their partnering company that had the issue but has absolutely no contact with them. but someone might be able to get back to me by Tuesday but still suggests i go in and still re pay for mail forwarding. Canada seriously needs a better service for this crap. talk about a company that gets paid to have their fingers up their asses all day!
"My package, with my address, is not left at mu\y house but sent to a post office, who returned it to sender. I was away at my Grandfather's funeral and couldn't pick it up in the allocated time. So why they HELL would you return to sender. It's not a mystery where I live: IT HAS MY ADDRESS ON IT!!! Whose bright idea is it that a package should be returned to sender instead of the person to whom it is addressed. It's ALWAYS the Canada Post items that are re-routed. I never have these issues with other delivery services unless there is a fee associated (which there wasn't for this nor any of the others Canada Post fails to deliver). You guys are never going to keep up at this rate and frankly I don't care if you go under."
"Here is another one for the list of one star reviews: I live in Victoria, BC. My spouse has medical condition and the time is of the essence. She has been sitting by the door waiting for her package to be delivered. The door knock never came. Instead just the good old slip for package pick up at the local post office. She went to the post office to find out that she CAN'T pick up her package even though she had her name match on the photo ID. Phone number match as well as a receipt with a tracking number. They would still not allow her to take possession of the package since the address on her ID DIDN'T MATCH THE ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE??????? Since we recently moved, our renewed drivers license with the CURRENT address hasn't come in yet....... and now she is in the hospital because she has to have her medication administered.

I don't even have words to describe how I feel right now. I hope that someone out there reads these posts. I have been on the phone for the last 47:04 MINUTES (go figure) TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO SPEAK WITH SOMEONE. I am going to send this anywhere I can and raise more awareness. Hopefully this policy will be changed SOON."
"Worst customer service ever. I called in to the small business number to fix my shipping label. Turns out that number just goes to a dispatcher who will route your call. So not only did I wait 50 minutes to get to the dispatcher who can't do anything to solve my problem I have to wait another 45 minutes+ for my problem to be solved. Btw I'm still waiting on the line...

This is unacceptable!"
"Zero stars if possible ... like all the other people on this forum - this is the worst operating company in North America. They could screw up a one car parade. I have been trying to cancel my ""business reply service"" for over a year now and these idiots keep sending me a bill ... not paying and ready for the fight. I have followed up with four emails and limited to no response. I wish this dinosaur would die already. Here is the fun part; time for another strike!! Over-paid, and drastically under-skilled in the customer service area."
"I ordered a roll of stamps online at Canadapost.ca. Of all the businesses to not get shipping right!! I put the full address with unit numbers in both the billing and shipping address. When they generate the shipping, they completely leave out the unit number. I call to get it fixed while in transit and two weeks later and 1 hour worth of phone calls, I decided to cancel because they still cannot get it fixed in a simple and quick way. They need to contact the warehouse and then resend the order in another 5 business days. How hard is it for a mail services company to get mailing right?!?"
Forgot my package on the truck two days in a row. Getting real sick of dealing with this company.
"Terrible. I had given my address with the unit clearly on the order and of course they managed to not get the unit number and now i‚Äôve been waiting for my package for over a week now when it said 2-3
business days. They had gotten here, called and said it was here but they just need the unit again, called, gave it and now another day wait. Riiiiidiculous."
"Express post just totally messed up my delivery and delivered my package back to me. I had a time limit to get court documents to the person and they did not deliever the package at all. I had to put my family at risk delivering the papers on time our selves. Express post supervisor didn't even call me back within the four hours they promised to have it rectified. Their incompetent delivery driver could not read the ""To"" and"" From"" correctly and he should not be delivering anything anymore."
"I‚Äôve used Canada post multiple times and everything was fine. My packages would arrive on time and everything was honestly good. A few times items have been a little damage but nothing crazy. Overall I was satisfied. However, recently I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gotten into them? My package said it‚Äôs made it to its destination area weeks ago. But still hasn‚Äôt been delivered ? Items have been in my city for over three weeks and still haven‚Äôt arrived to my house ? I ordered stuff for a special occasion only for not being able to use it cause of Canada post. I used to live their service now I‚Äôm beyond disappointed."
"I went to pick up my package but the lady denied it because i didn't have proper identification which i understand, the part i don't understand is the level of costumer service which with i was sent home. She was so rude that i will never come here for my future packages. I request Canada post and their management to please focus on better costumer service or at least hire people with some.
Address : 123 Rexdale Blavd Etobicoke. M9W 1P0"
"This is the 4th time that I have ordered something that was sent via Canada Post express and it has been out for delivery alllll day and not arrived to my door! My neighbours all joke that the mailman doesn't deliver on Monday Wednesday or Friday. Clearly the item is in the mail bag as the tracking number says OUT FOR DELIVERY. I took the day off work each time that this has happened and then the item will be delivered within the following two days while |I am not home so that I have to wait yet ANOTHER day to pick it up at the post office because it needs to be processed. I am beyond frustrated with this organization. Total, total garbage."
"Canada Post has no common sense.

After my experience with Canada Post today, I will never use this delivery service ever again.

My parcel arrived locally from Germany from notifications given and indicated it was out for delivery as of 11:03am this morning. By 11:39am, it was already flagged to be returned and is enroute to the sender. Staying home, at no point did I get any notifications of an arrived shipment from my concierge.

Contacting customer service only provided more headaches and less of a solution. The explanation was that Canada Post's policies according to law was to ensure shipment address had to include unit numbers and if not, shipment will be directly returned to the sender.

Unless I was willing to hunt the delivery truck down, there was nothing that could be done in terms of retrieving or halting the policy. Even though the package is according to the service agent getting prepped locally to ship back to Germany, nobody had the power to track it down. All I could do is wait at home for this whole debacle of a service to finish and re-try the procedure again in weeks or months of time.

That is a poor solution given and it is one without common sense and immediate action. Who in the right mind would follow suggestions given by your customer service team to wait and try shipment again after this nightmare?"
Canada post international delivery Canada to UK so fare one month and nothing received! Didn't realise Canada post was still in the age of steam!!
"LOST MY PACKAGE

I got a sweater which cost me $145. They came on thursday but left a note since i wasn't home. I went to the post office with my note to pick it up but the lady couldn't find it in the back. She took my note which i got from Canada post and wrote my name snd phone number and told me she will get back to me. SHE DIDN'T. I called stlaturday, another lady picked up and she said there was no note that whe she saw. SO THEY EVEN LOST THE TRACKING PACKAGE NOTE. she gave me a customer service number to call. And she said they will look into it three days AFTER monday. I need that sweater for a concert on oct 4. Today is September 22. I doubt I'll get it back by then. Im off to buy another outfit"
"I would give no stars if that were an option. Canada Post just don‚Äôt bother delivering parcels anymore. They just leave a card saying they were there and you can pick up your parcel at the depot. They don‚Äôt knock on the door or ring the door bell, so even if you are home waiting for your delivery you are going to have to pick it up yourself from the depot. You have paid Canada Post for it to be delivered to your home. There is now a further cost to you in time and gas to arrange for your parcel to be picked up from the depot. So you are now paying twice for the delivery. My parcel this week was a refrigerator so I guess the delivery guy could not be bothered to lift it off the truck. When you go to the depot to pick it up they can‚Äôt find it. A refrigerator is difficult to lose! This is not the first time they have not delivered the parcel and just left the card. Canada Post are a disgrace and should be ashamed of their poor performance."
"constantly loses your package, there customer service is terrible and they will drive off without honking constantly because they dont WANT to do there job and they know they can get away with cutting corners."
"Canada post is the most incompetent organization I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I think you have to have a below average IQ to work here. On multiple occasions I checked my mailbox and have received the ""sorry we missed you"" door hanger after I have been at home all day. I have witnessed a mail carrier putting these door hangers I to mailboxes like they were pieces of mail instead of actually delivering the packages as they are paid to do. I have called and complained several times and the customer service reps are rude and make some pretty far fetched excuses about why they can't do their jobs. The latest fiasco, my unit number was missing from the package so they just up and returned it to the sender in Ontario. I asked why they didn't call me to inquire about the unit number or just send it to the post office. This is something fed-ex or UPS would do. ""We are not fed-ex"" was the customer service reps response. Of course you're not! If you were I would have my package!!! I can't even believe this outfit is still in business. It's unbelievable."
"Please google...Chris Smith Canada Post CBC News...Read to see how you destroyed my life.

Read the article to understand why one star. The ombadsman is esculating this but still waiting to be assigned after a month..."
"For the last year and a half I have had nothing but issue lost packages, countless dealings with their rude customer service chimps and ridiculous excuses for pathetic service. I currently have 3 packages that have been verified to have arrived in Canada ...3.5 months ago and they have still not been delivered to my door! Is there any excuse for that? Not by a long shot,

A guideline to reading the reviews of Canada Post.... Anything above one star is more than likely a paid review. (over the top a$$ kissing is a dead giveaway as well so give it a rest...we all know the service has been declining rapidly /steadily for the last 2-3 years)"
"You pretty much don't know what your gonna get. You can either get your package late, the agent could not knock and just post the"" we've been here"" sticker, tracking is rarely up to date, or the odd time (very rare) you actually get your package on time and delivered. So it's just frustrating having to deal with them."
They're always late or lose my package. I can never rely on them to get my package on time. I'm about ready to stop ordering from companies that use Canada Post. I wish I could give them less than 1 star because they don't even deserve that. If only Amazon would come in and take over to get rid of these people and show them how to properly run a company.
the absolute worst possible carriers to ship with. Slowest shipping on the planet and will guaranteed mess it up and make it late every single time even when you order the same thing at the same time every week. Don‚Äôt even bother honestly Hong Kong shipping will do a better job. They arnt a bunch of slow union pri*k$
"Unacceptable Medical Deliveries
Countless times now they have delivered a SERIOUS MEDICAL package that requires MY signature to a random box. HECK !! Extremely wrong, inconvenient and SCARY.
They even mark it delivered (again without delivering it to me) inwhich I would have no way to track further or prove if it did go missing.
I cannot lose this package, ever.
They don‚Äôt seem to give a crap and said‚Äù oh it happens a few times a week‚Äù then goddamn pay attention and do your job. They need to take every package seriously.. even without signature. Legals options will be pursued if lost/stolen due to carelessness at FINAL delivery.
I apologize for the hostility but it‚Äôs getting out of control and I am worried that I will lose my belongings. Thankyou."
Their delivery man always leave a delivery note even you live in a house or town house and they did not even bother to use the doorbell. It really annoys me when I order online and the company use the Canada Post for delivery because Canada Post is the worst service of all delivery company. Most of them are lazy. I tried to call them and they are unprofessional in terms of costumer service.
Worst company ever!! Doesnt matter what or where it is late and or damaged
"They deserve ZERO star. I ordered something from China and paid extra for delivery confirmation. The tracking said it was delivered to the community mail box, but I didn't see any key left in my mailbox. I opened a ticket with Canada Post; however, they just completed their investigation and said there was nothing they can do.
Obviously, if there was NO KEY left in my mailbox to retrieve my package at the bigger slot, it MUST be Canada post's fault.
Sender can't open a claim with Canada Post simply because it was not sent from Canada. This is a total lost case."
If I could give less then 1 star I would...never on time...late parcel delivery on a regular bases...phone wait times half an hour or more...we need another postal company...canada post sucks...and they could care less about customer satisfaction...not worth my time or money...oh yeah and I not only pay postage...my tax money supports them as well..
My package has been out of custom for more than a week and I still haven't received it yet and it was a express package. Now these worker want more money for rotten terrible overpriced service!!!
"Greedy money suckers. Amazon qouted a $7.99 fee through canada post. Brought it to canada post, you charge $15. Hmmmmm, i wonder who is corrupt. You're company is pathetic. Where's your pride and excellence you hold so dear to your custumers???????? I guess it's UPS time."
"I sent an package from Australia to Ontario, and it has languished for a month without being delivered. Canada Post would not allow a ticket to be submitted due to international postcode. Terrible customer service."
"3rd time I have paid for xpress post on a parcel and the parcel didn't arrive in the two day timeline. (Calgary to Edmonton) This time the parcel arrived at the Edmonton sorting facility THREE DAYS AGO. Tracking status of ""in transit"" has not changed. This time I believe it's either lost or stolen at the facility. Not looking forward to trying to get my money back"
"Canada Post has the worst customer service I have ever hard to deal with.

Two situations over the past two weeks..

I am a small business owner, next to a Shoppers Drug Mart which has CP office in it. They were holding my package for 3 weeks, and sent several back because I did not put a unit number on the address. They were apparently confused because we both share the same address as we are in the same plaza... and the business name on the package itself was not enough of an indicator of where it is to be delivered.

Today, I went to a different CP office located in an Avondale, I walked in right at 7pm and the useless woman working behind the counter said ""sorry I just closed"" I walked away with out saying anything because I almost lost it on her. It takes less than 30 seconds to look at a tracking number, my license and hand me my package.

Unbelievable that my taxes go towards this terrible service, if CP didn't exist then everyone working there would have starved to death on the street long ago as they are incompetent to preform even the most basic tasks and lack the initiative required to be a productive member of society.

Sorry, not sorry."
"We want to say thank you to the amazing postman who delivers our packages and mail via Canada Post in Port Alberni. He always makes sure we get our packages and doesn't leave them out in the rain or for thieves to steal unlike purolator or UPS.
He is patient with both myself and my wife knowing we have a baby and is always super friendly when we answer the door. Because of this amazing service we have been picking to use Canada Post even if it costs us more money to ship items. He is a great asset to your company and is why we choose to use Canada post üôÇ , and he deserves to hear how he is doing a great job and its appreciated.

Ontop of that the staff at the local canada post are great and friendly. even if its a minute before closing they will help you out."
"My mailman never delivers our mail properly, yet we regularly receive mail from other people. Sometimes we get mail meant for people on different streets with the same house number.

In addition, I rarely get a slip when one of my packages is delivered. I've also had two different packages simply lost or undelivered completely. They're the two which have had valuables in them, so I'm honestly wondering if somebody within Canada Post is stealing stuff. Seems to always happen right around Mississauga.

When I try to follow up they either don't take my calls, redirect me to the same tracking site, or make it impossible to lodge a proper complaint. Even when I go to the Post Office in person, the service is rude and unhelpful. They just keep sending me around in circles."
"They always deliver packages to my door in good condition, and on time. The workers are very friendly and work hard. I really appreciate their work!
I've never had an issue with them."
"Canada Post workers always have a bad attitude and don't do their jobs.
No matter how many times I complained to the company, the workers keep doing whatever they've done...
They just prepare the 'ready to pick up' notes even before they arrive the receivers' places...stick them and gone in few seconds. Every time, except one time in my whole experience with Canada Post, I needed to go to a close Canada post office to get my package...because they never deliver.
If it is because the company pushes them to work so fast and they have too many loads to deliver, I still think it is the company's fault due to their mal-management skills."
Canada Post lost my package and now I'm out money. Customer service is a joke. An hour and a half on hold with no one answering. Absolutely ridiculous.
"They received a electronic information on the 2018/08/23 for pick up the parcel in Ontario, on 2018/09/02 my order left Mississauga, today is the 2018/09/07 and still nothing here.
Do they deliver on a bicycle??? It's just a little thing, not even 1lb!!

CRAZY 15 days already for a little parcel 1lb only...that really sucks! It's not the first time, and for sure not the last time.
CANADA POST is the worst world wide!!!
I wish DHL, UPS etc. got bigger and for private persons in Canada very soon"
"Bought the express shipping but it‚Äôs super late

Terrible service"
"They are painfully slow and very expensive considering how slow they are. On two occasions I ordered stickers within the same city, they were mailed by letter mail and did not arrive for 15 business days. I have also ordered things over seas and they have sat in hubs awaiting entry scans for over a month. Crazy expensive, slow delivery, always going on strike. Useless."
The employee is rude and verbally abusive. Does not scan my prepaid items to the system while I wait saying I'm disrupting other customers. I don't trust Canada post as my packages go missing frequently.
Dont send anything on here their customer service really bad! Your items were lost forever...dont send without the trackable ones. Or dont use their services..all they will said that i cant do anything about it...very good reason canadapost!üò°üò°üò° my 2package were nothing..my time and money was waste...üò°üò°
"Yeah, they tend to like missing expensive parcels. I even got 2 expensive phones received next door instead."
Brutal service.trying to contact these people is a joke!
"We pay for express shipping (2-3 days), but we never get anything before a week. Bunch of thiefs. Shame on every single one of their low-life employees"
I wish there was an option to give a negative 1 review. The costumer service is EXTREMELY rude. I paid for shipping and needed something to go out of town. I waited at home for 3 days so I wouldn‚Äôt miss my package only for them to lie that they made a delivery attempt. I told them I was unable to pick it up at the post office because of a disability and they still refuse to help me. I called 4 times.
This is a very bad unaccceptable and un organizied company ever. The people lie and will not put a supperviser on they put you on hold and hang up. I sent two riffles to Alberta paid 200 dollars have not seen the guns and it has been 9 days
"If I could give them less than 1 star, I would. They lost a lantern slide from the late 1800's, that can't be replaced. And for that, I will never use their services again."
"We have been shipping regular packages for the last 5 years and for the most part i would say they were efficient and cost effective. However things really go sideways when they lose a package. They lost THREE of our high value packages in one shipment last month and their tracking system and customer service system is a joke. First of all, the tracking can only show where it was last scanned in. Where it goes after that is anybody guess. I was told it could be in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary or Winnipeg, and that it SHOULD show up in Moncton for scanning eventually. (Ya. If they haven't disappeared, altogether! Which apparently they had.) We were shuffled from pillar to post, from one to customer rep to another, in and out of country, with varying levels of incompetence. We were told we didn't have an account with them even though we have been using a corporate account for 5 years. Finally they closed the ""investigation"" after 3 weeks without the packages being found or any explanation of where they might have gone. (They eventually were delivered all together with no explanation of where they had been) When i asked for a refund i was told they would put three checks in the mail, and when those didn't arrive, I was then told they were credited to our account. The service manager was snotty and rude and in serious need of some training on how to handle a complaint. All in all a terrible experience. ****Note to Can Post: a tracking system is only good if it indicates where the package is GOING TO not just where it has been, and you need to be able to contact the sorting facilities DIRECTLY to find out if a package has become lost in the facility. Telling your customer you can't do that is just not good enough. And finally - it is YOUR JOB to find a missing package and treat the upset person with some respect - after all they are PAYING YOUR SALARY!! Knock off the snotty attitude or find a job more suited to your personality."
"I've just been told by Canada Post that if the address on my Government Issued PhotoID did not match the address on the parcel being delivered to me then they could not give me my package at a Canada Post location. 2 Funny things with that: 1) Government gives you 6 months to update your ID and 2) In a previous City my family lived, Canada Post was always delivering my brother and one of my sisters' mail to the other family who had members with the same first and last name even though the addresses on the mail was completely different then the address they delivered to. One of my sisters ended up gaining a friend because the other family got tired of having it redelivered to them after putting the mail back in Canada Post so they drove it across the City to my family.
Also, Canada Post Chat system is a rip off- long que and if they don't get to you in 15 minutes you are cut out of the que (""keep in mind this conversation will end if left inactive for 15 minutes.... you are in line to chat with an agent. xx customers are ahead of you"") I was cut off in less than the 15 minutes. They do not offer an email address."
"I really hope Amazon grows their own delivery service in Canada and drops Canada Post altogether. After paying for the faster shipping, again, the package is late. I had a delivery brought by Amazon Canada and it was 3 days early and they even sent me a notification with photo confirmation that it had been delivered."
"Trust me, if there is rating for negtive, i will definatley to give -10 as rating.
It was few times that i am beening waiting for my package at home for the whole day, by the end of day, i found pick up slip has been placed on the door.
How can the stupid post service exit so long with so many lazy staff without knowing what the jobs they are doing!"
"My paid temporary mailforwarding: mail continued to be delivered to the ‚Äòold‚Äô address for some time, i.e. not forwarded. Then: resumption of mail delirey to my regular address (confirmed by Canada Post) has NOT resumed (still waiting after 2 1/2 weeks). Mail continued to be sent to the temporary address (which I can no longer access) for how long, no one knows.
Those union protected employees can do anything, make any mistake they want, screw up whatever they want, without any fear of disciniplary action, god forbid, any threats of being fired for incompetence."
"Totally and utterly rubbish service/ website. Their website states 5 business days guaranteed delivery with Xpresspost International and yet when a parcel doesn't arrive in stated time the agent (who took over an hour to answer the call) states that their T&Cs (not listed or linked to anywhere on the page that says delivery within 5 days guaranteed!!) says that once customs has an item it is out of their control. So, not really guaranteed is it?????
And to top it off, try and make a complaint about it, no, no, no the link on their website stating How to file a complaint takes you to another page which has absolutely NOTHING to do with how to make a complaint. Because why would it...
And try to chat with someone, 15 people in the cue and the second I tried I got a message back saying currently experiencing higher than normal demand, try again later...
I will never use Canada Post again."
"Absolute garbage company, they'll never see a dime from me again. Package has been stuck in the Richmond black hole for almost a month"
"I wish i could rate them one star. Why would you issue a statement on your website for next day ""GUARANTEE"" if you can't deliver a local deliver the next day. Don't mislead people and trick them into paying extra for next day deliver with your fake ""guarantee""
Awful service - called customer service for help regarding why the tracking information says it's out for delivery but the rep just simply said that the parcel is on route to a postal facility..
Apparently no way to get a hold of their drivers (who's great business plan was this?) and no idea which facility it's headed to so i can't even go pick it up. Whenever possible - avoid using their misleading deceiving service."
"I receiver an email indicating that my package is delivered. I checked all around the house it in not there. So I decided to check the security cameras. and guess what; the ""post woman"" did walked into house that day but didn't bring or leave any package but still sent me an email that she did the job and delivery is completed
wow.
So I don't know where my package (200 dollars purse from Michael Kors) is!!
Either she was drunk and took it somewhere else or kept it for herself, who knows.
I can not even make a complaint to her supervisor because that is what the sender is supposed to do.

Well done Canada Post"
"A big waste of time for the Canadian budget. Make no mistake, we pay those losers salary. I sent mail from Maple Ridge to Richmond, gets, there the same day, then for whatever reason they send it to Winnipeg, where it stays for 9 days till someone notices that is in the wrong spot. Finally, it gets delivered, or that's what the tracking says. I forgot I sent it as registered mail. Now I am trying to get a refund, I called, it says 10 minutes which is any way BS, I am looking at the clock it is 20 minutes and they still didn't pick up."
"My passport was sent back from the immigration 1 month ago.Still i havent received it.Spoke to several people in canada post.They just say they are helpless.No compensation,no complaints accepted and no idea where my passport is!!!i wish there was some way to protest.The worst irresponsible ridiculous service ever!!!"
"Marked my parcel as delivered, when in reality it was being sent back to the UK. Had the sender send it again. Marked as delivered again. Package was lost. The absolute WORST postal service out there"
I give 1 star because there is no option for 0 star.
Calling into the call center is least 30+ minute wait as they are having higher then normal calls. Many of the ones who answer have no desire to really help and are unwilling to send the call up to a supervisor. You are told one will call back between 1 - 4 hours! However no will call you it is as if they have the attitude of if we stall you long enough you will go away. Bad service is allowed as you can never report it!
"My post woman handed me a note saying to collect my item from post office because ""she thought nobody will be home""... So I called up post office and they said I can collect it only the next day, they also won't redeliver unless I pay... It was NEVER DELIVERED in the first place. I have a job and a life and I shouldn't have to spend time to sort it out just because someone didn't want to do their job. I tried to call customer service but nobody picking up, obviously the line is busy because of people complaining about the service. Canada post should learn from Royal Mail who know how to do their job properly."
Canada post is awful. Never again will I ever use it to send packages. Their customer service is hurrendous. We had a package shipped urgent and needed to know a delivery time. All she kept saying was before 8 pm. Have dealt with fed ex and ups and they have been awesome to deal with. They would call a driver and give an idea as to when a package would be delivered. Spoke to two customer service agents after holding on the phone for over a half hour both times. Neither one would offer me any information. This package was needed urgently and she would not help us at all. I will never ever use this service again.
"I've ALLEGEDLY received a notice stating where to pick my package up, so, I go and try to pick it up, not there, its on the truck, (STILL) allegedly they've tried to deliver it in the last 2 days COMPLETE BULL, Canada post needs to be SHUT DOWN ASAP worst mail service I've ever seen or dealt with in my life, I'm sure I'll be going back down at 4pm when I still haven't received my stuff to get it, as our beautiful mail representatives for queen street don't care, and my mail service guy has already said ""I don't care whether south end gets there stuff or not, this is just a pay check for me"" when I asked him if he knew anything about my stuff, SO Canada Post, I say as a citizen of Sarnia, ON, PULL UP this is such shady service!!!!! BTW FOR 2 DAYS YA'LL HAVE ALLEGEDLY BROUGHT IT TO MY HOUSE WHICH IS A LIE, I'VE BEEN UP AT 730AM BOTH DAYS.... and currently as I write this, I""m 20 minutes trying to get through to a CSR at the 1800 Number"
"My mail is still somewhere on the way even it's been 5 days after the expected date now. The latest updated info was three weeks ago and they guaranteed me that I paid for the fastest envelope at the office, which cost me $80. Sent inquiry tickets, no reply. Called, no one picked up the phone. The mail is urgent, but I have no freak clue where it is and what I can do."
"On Friday Aug 17, my parcel tracking said my parcel had been delivered to my community mail box. We needed this parcel as it was a hard drive with music we purchased for a wedding on the 18th. Our supplier was delayed in shipping so I asked for him to give me the tracking number. By 3 Oclock it was not there but said it was, so I was in panic mode. I called Canada post and explained my dilemma. The first gentleman checked everything possible then turned it over to a supervisor. he in turn called the postal depot, and where ever else but could not get an answer. He then sent an urgent email to his supervisor and the postal outlet. I do not know how but at 4pm, a gentleman came to our door and delivered the parcel. Thank you Canada post for every thing.

"I needed a replacement key for the community mail box.
I made the request 14 days ago.
They said I would have new keys and replaced lock in 72 hours.
I have made numerous calls to Canada post requesting the new lock and key. Which the request was never fulfilled. I‚Äôve had no access to my mail for 2 weeks. 3 complaints tickets issued and still waiting.
Worst service ever !!"
"They have lost my express mail , they say custom has it , custom rep says Canada post 100% has it , Canada post rep ( another rep , exact word , says they are lying ) and these are after more than 2 and a half hour being on phone , such incompetent people"
"Sent registered mail to Sweden via Canada Post. It was the perfect storm of useless bureaucracy. Our package got lost. The tracking system provided useless information. These losers at Postnord (the Swedish end) advised us that we needed to complete some paperwork for them to initiate a search. Call me crazy but I thought that was the purpose of the ridiculously expensive tracking fee. A strongly advise that you go with the only competent carriers - the private courier companies. BTW, I gave them one star because it won't accept zero."
Canada post your a disgrace. I have been to the post office 4 times in a month for 4 separate reasons. You can‚Äôt xpress post packages. You can‚Äôt forward mail. You can‚Äôt issue refunds. You can‚Äôt find packages you have had in your possession for 6 days because it was on a shelf above eye level? Your staff isn‚Äôt properly trained and your carriers are lazy and don‚Äôt deliver bulky items. Like ICBC we have virtually no other options and you know it. You have one job Canada Post one job.
"Missing package, 8 weeks, no way to report it as a US Citizen.

I purchased some bullet journals from a seller in Canada (didn't realize she was in Canada when I made the purchase). She mailed the package to me June 27, and asked if I preferred tracked or untracked. As any package leaving the post office in the US would have tracking, I didn't think that made sense, and I said no tracking.

It is now August 15th, and I still don't have my package. Yes, I used PayPal goods and services, but requesting a refund means the seller is out money, when CANADA POST is responsible for this. Worse yet, if you attempt to file a claim for a missing package on their website, it will not permit you to enter anything but a Canadian address, even after you indicate that you are reporting an international package loss.

I don't want the seller to be out what I paid and their postage because Canada Post is responsible for my missing package.

Now August 30th, still no sign of my package. I will never purchase something from Canada without tracking ever again."
"Yet again, no attempt at a delivery for absolutely no reason.
Canada Post is the absolute worst. If I could avoid using them I 1000% would.
My apartment number is my buzzer code its CLEARLY stated everywhere. Attached to it.. also my name.
BOTH times they didn't even both to buzz my door but yet somehow got into the building to leave me a card.
The first time I caught the post man and said why did you not even bother, he said oh.. were not supposed to bother in apartments. It's your job to go get it from the post office.
UMM NO. I have things shipped to my home to NOT go to the post office, that's how mail works Mr mailman....

Ridiculous.
Once again another event ruined because my packages were not even bothered to be delivered properly.. or even attempted to be delivered properly..
Thanks Canada Post."
"""Delivery attempts"" to my office with staff available 9-5pm... Failed attempts because ""business was closed."" Ummm.... No good try if you're going to lie why don't you pick a better undelivered code! Called Customer Service 3 times. 1st time they gave me a bogus address to ""pick up"" my parcel as the status was ""Hold for Pickup"" (and of course with no pick-up slip delivered to me). The location was literally an semi abandoned plaza out in the middle of no where. 2nd call same day, lady told me ""oh, that status means it's wanting for US to pick up the parcel from somewhere to be delivered."" Ok, well if what you're saying is true - how come there were delivery attempts? (failed). 3rd call the person was helpful, said dont understand how come the status says hold for pick-up with no slip. He opened a ticket for me and after 4 days the parcel was delivered.

So again, another parcel is coming to me. ""Failed delivered attempt"" at 9:07am, when my office opens and staff are here at 8am.... Now the parcel is ""Out for delivery"" yesterday 9:47am.... NEXT day - still the same status! I hope the postman is safe! He/She's been missing all night!

On the phone with them now - hoping to get some resolution on this 2nd incident... fingers crossed."
Horrible customer service!!! I was suppose to recieve a notice on August 8th for a package coming from the US that I was suppose to pick up. I never recieved any notice and I went today to the Canada post office with the track number. The employer of Canada post tells me that my package was sent back to its foreign country! First off They are liars because I never notified paper in the mail. And why the hell would they send a package back to its foreign country?! When I was never notified!!!! How dare they do something without letting the customer know about it!!! They are so stupid!!! And I call customer service. And the lady I spoke to was no help at all!!!! Stay away from Canada Post!!!!
Such bad customer service. Avoid them if you can
"They never deliver my packages to my door. They always drop it at the nearest post office even though I‚Äôve paid for signature service. They claim I wasn‚Äôt home when I wait feet from the door all day. Plus I find the pick up notices in the post box down the block proving they never bothered to come to the house. Also on numerous occasions money has been stolen by them and I know it was them because I have a post box with a key and the only mail that goes missing are letters with cash in them.

I have attempted on every occasion to contact them and they either ignore my attempts or they say they are looking into it and then come back with the answer of ‚Äúwell sorry but we don‚Äôt know what happened‚Äù. They never offer help or refund for the times they don‚Äôt deliver as you paid to have delivered. Basically they are stealing your money. If you get paid to do a service and don‚Äôt do it then keep the money that is theft."
"Canada post lost my package second time. The customer service that I have was horrible and rude. I live in an apartment and they should leave a key or a notice in there. They leave absolute nothing and the website shows in the community box. I called the customer service, and they said they leave by my door. How come there was no key and notice. I am confuse. They asked me to call the sender, and the sender sent an identical package to me. Canada Post lost again, and ask me to call the sender. The sender was very nice and refund me the whole amount. I am very disappoint with Canada Post."
"Saturday morning had a package sent from Edmonton Alberta. Sent xpress 1-3 day guaranteed. This is what their guaranteed delivery is 1-3 days.
It‚Äôs now Thursday and still in transit from Richmond. Now being told Friday for delivery. Guaranteed? 1-3 business days? Never will use Canada post again!"
Canada Post shipped my package to the wrong house although my address was clear on the package. It was even signed by someone who wasn't in my household. The agent claimed their policy is to open up a Service Ticket and that the seller has to deal with it going forward. This causes a huge strain and inconvenience for myself and the seller for Canada Post's screw up. Another case of not accepting responsibility for their mess up.
The service was the worst of what I've ever seen. My express letter (1 day delivery) was not delivered in 4 days. Post office representative even rejected to provide superviser number. I will try to avoid using Canada Post in future. Thanks.
"Canada Post is so bad, they say they attempted delivery but I was home all day and did not hear anything. They don't leave the parcel at the door, they freaking delay the process and let you go get it by yourself after a full day has passed. Awesome."
"will avoid using canada post again

delayed my package for days after paying for express shipping (i.e. was in my city but was not able to deliver/pick up)-- will not consider using again"
If i could leave a zero i would - they returned my bridesmaid dress that I had to re order because of emergency for a wedding that weekend because according to the customer service rep my wasn't name properly on the package (which is RIDICULOUS because they wrote down my name and full address on the delivery notice that was left here). Then when i pointed this out they said that someone had said I didn't live in the building - its a condo - who would know that. I even asked the concierge who was working at the time (who I know personally) if he said that (even by error) and he told me he hadn't spoken to anyone. Canada post weren't apologetic and helpful at ALL - and the 2nd time I called the man hung up on me. I can see in the tracking the tried to deliver on they 30Jul2018 and then on the 01Aug2018 a the returned it (Recipient not located at address). How could that be when they didn't even try delivering it again on that day?! On top of that - it was literally returned the day I tried to pick it up (01Aug2018) - and they refused to try to recover the package (even though I can see that it is in Mississauga- package was to be delivered to Toronto). ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EVER. I WOULD USE ANY OTHER SERVICE BEFORE THEM. Now I have to tell me friend I don't have the bridesmaid dress ...CANADA POST NEEDS TO FIX ITSELF - THE WORST!
"there is no customer service at all, after waiting for more than 20 min each time I call, they don't have enough information, and cannot solve your problem, managers are not available and no one cares about costumer!!!!!!"
"Good afternoon, do not advise you to cooperate with Canada Post, if you do not want problems yourself and lost parcels!!!! From Ukraine was sent a parcel 13.07.2018 to Canada, 15.07 she left the territory of Ukraine, and everything went missing, I tried to contact technical support Canadapost, wrote them a lot of letters, but, I understand them anyway, that I pay not a small money for delivery, as well The cost of the parcel was $800, it was supposed to be a gift! But I understand that Canada Post is still on its reputation, as the parcel is already traveling more than 40 days! I do not advise anyone to work with them, if you do not want to stay without money and parcel.
My track number of parcel CP031052507UA can see for yourself."
"Since Canada Post changed to community mail boxes it is the worst postal service ever. If a large parcel is due on a Friday then don't expect it to be delivered. My experience is that they probably write out the delivery notices before leaving their facility then just quietly pop them on the front door handle without even knocking or ringing the bell...they don't even have the parcel with them!! I expect they just want to finish early on a Friday and let you pick it up from them on the Monday. Also, on a Friday another ploy they use is to say its been routed to another city so they still don't have to deliver it that day. I only wish Amazon would use couriers all the time.. even if I have to pay for it."
"this is the second time Canada post has sloughed me off. i was expecting my goods and yet again they haven't delivered. I waited a good near 40 minutes on the phone expecting to get info as to where my package was and the helpline said they have no info as to why it is being held in the depot. I will be bringing this up with amazon and ask that they dont use canada post hopefully there are other options.

ps. the helpline did at least notify me as to where my package was. where i should have been able to get that info on the tracking number online"
"Canada post deserves ZERO stars. They lost an item that I'd purchased costing approx $800. Hours and hours to get any type contact with a live person and now I have to wait weeks for them to give me 'next steps'.
I don't know how something sent with tracking just disappears into thin air and no one is held accountable. It's nuts."
"Bought a money order I don't use later on. Wanted to refund it, phone them, first call they said I can cash it at my bank. But my bank said no... because it's not pay to myself. So I went to a postal office, representative is like a junkie telling me they don't have cash now, gotta have to wait until they have the cash...wt f... So I phoned them again telling them that i bank doesn't want to cash it for me, the representative on the phone was with lazy voice and couldn't even speak clearly, told me that they cannot refund it for me because it's still within 45 days of purchase...w t f..."
"I had to renew my licences and it took 2 weeks to get here like normal unfortunately the mail man put it in the wrong box and it go sent back. They sent it back and I recieved a call july 6th after it was deliever july 3 so took two days to get back to where it came from they said it was returned in error and the address was correct with the correct name. They sent it back to me july 9th... my paper copy expired on the 20th. As the 20th approached still no idea yet it too 2 days to go back to edmonton but it has taken 2 weeks again and yet still no received and important piece of personal mail is lost that is used to do some many thing. Once I reached the expire date on my temporary licence I had no choice but to go in and get a new one and in doing so they now sent me a me licneces in the mail which I hope does arrive as the other one still has yet to arrived so it is lost in the mail... i had spoken with the dev 6 times to check to make sure it wasnt returned and never was and i called canada post and they gave me the same story that they cant track personal mail as is are sent as normal mail. They explained they go through 30000 pieces of mail ever day which is understandable and I acknowledge this that it may not be easy but something that important should not have been lost and better attention to the right boxs would be better... what I dont get is it took them 2 days to send it back to edmonton yet it's been taking the 2 weeks going on 3 weeks to receive it and yet it won't be good now because of having to re order one due to paper one expiring. It is unfortunate the lack of mail coming and how some of my mail hasnt yet show up. It worries me especially with personal I'd like licences can get lost that easily I do hope and pray the second one comes on time and I am able to do the things I need todo. I am reporting this because this is a concern of personal identity that something that is used for identification can take so long and it is unfair as I need that for so many personal things.

Thank you and I do hope they improve greatly."
CP's delivery service needs improve. My parcel is out for delivery for 2 days but I live in only 15 minutes driving distance away from their hub. It is unacceptable and unreasonable. Wasting too much time chatting with their CSR and checking the online status in these two days. Never had such a bad experience.
"About two months ago I had an envelope mailed to me from downtown Ottawa to Orleans...10 km..it took TWO WEEKS.
I mailed my son a birthday card on July 6, from Orleans (Ottawa) to Comox BC and he just received it TODAY July 24. Canada Post there is no excuse for this."
"No way to contact locally for info. Stuck on hold with a 1800 number for over 20min. Package not delivered on time. Tracking info no updated. Completely unreliable and terrible service.
They don't even deserve one star."
"Paid for priority shipping and it‚Äôs taked over 10 days to get my package. Why do we need to pay extra when the company won‚Äôt put the effort into making that the priority, in the end it just becomes Unnecessary for everyone. I‚Äôm obviously Going to get a refund however I am extremely disappointed with the Postal service my ‚Äúcountry‚Äù has provided me."
"Can't stand Canada Post. We've been using them for years to send and receive packages from our eBay store and have never had huge issues with them until recently when we checked the mail and received a $500 bill from them for import fees that they claim have built up over the years. We have never failed to pay any fees associated with CP, so why do they send us this bill in a lump sum? Their staff are generally unfriendly and show no care for customers either, and we once had to tell off a CP manager for getting frustrated and slamming one of our fragile packages on the GROUND! She did this right in front of us and when I told her off, she said she didn't mean to slam it, it ""fell out of my hands."" I called BS and she told me not to frustrate her and she wouldn't have done it. Don't bother with Canada Post, they're a bunch of useless idiots."
"I have sent a registered letter to the UK on Monday 16 July it's just a letter, it's being 3 days and yet it's still sitting in Richmond sorting office it's has already being processed.
The fact of the matter in Canada , the Govt institutions like CRA , Citizenship and Canada Post are very very slow. These people who work for them are damn lazy and will do one thing per day. If this was another country my mail would been on the plane and in that country's post office by now.
Well never am I going to use Canada ""Slow coach"" Post.
Totally useless they should privatise these crown institutions and give it somebody who can do the job in reasonable time."
Brutal service. Use any other service. Xpresspost? What xpresspost? It's an actually nightmare with these clowns.
"I am really disappointed with Canadapost. In the first instance the cashier at the post office scanned the sender's postal code as the receiver's postal code so the mail went out to BC and then came back to Ottawa where the sender lives. I called their customer service and I was told that the parcel will be delivered back to the sender. While I was waiting for the parcel it was shipped back to BC. Now it's been out for delivery for three days now but not delivered. There is no update on the delivery either. It's more than a week now and the policy is now delivered.
I have another parcel leave for Kitchener and then it's coming back to Ottawa. Not sure what is wrong this time. Something seems to be wrong with Canadapost."
I paid 27$ for priority mail so that my package would be delivered within 5 days because i was about to leave the country. It didn't get delivered and i never receive the mail which contained the leftovers from my car insurance. F*** Canadapost and their service!
"Slow and expensive. Carriers are all lazy. My item has been out for delivery for 10 hours now. I heard ""verifying address"" really means that the carrier felt too lazy to deliver the package today."
"I received my mail damaged because the mailman decides it‚Äôs okay to forcefully shove in a box larger than my apartment‚Äôs mail slot. The box actually got stuck in the mail slot‚Äôs door and I had to damage the box itself to force it out. I‚Äôm upset! He has done this serveral times! I called Canada Post and they were not too helpful and now I have to wait for some unknown response. Apparently the situation will be monitored, but that hardly helps my issue now, since I own a damaged item and wasted my money. They didn‚Äôt even tell me how the issue would be resolved. I won‚Äôt be ordering anything else while this mailman terrorizes my street. Canada Post: you should care more about your customers and help them resolve their issues rather than pretending that you can‚Äôt do anything. Get better and more reliable workers who won‚Äôt damage products that the customer pays full price for only to receive it damaged because of your employee."
"They never deliver the packages to my condo in a highly accessible location- L4Z0A4, rather leave a notice that I should pick it from their pickup location, I frequently buy things online to save my time, but now I refrain buying from shippers who use Canada Post, due to poor service rendered by Canada Post (which is below-par to even poor third world countries). Once they dropped the key to my parcel (TV Set-top Box and remotes) in someone else's mailbox, I got it when the person who wrongly received the keys, contacted me through the address.

Few lazy people are giving the bad name to the whole organization.
Given choice, I will never use Canada Post and recommend it to others. If I am a seller using postal services, I will never use Canada Post, because of poor delivery experience.
Canada post you need to identify the crooks and terminate them."
Paid $30 for priority post GUARANTEED 2 day delivery - not delivered. Trying to call customer service just get an endless message they are experiencing heavy call volume - call back some other time
"Used Express Post , they told me guaranteed delivery next day.
The next day enveloped arrived early in the morning and sat all day without being processed. Now due to weekend will be 3 day delivery. I will get re fund. They take your money but don't give you the service. No accountability with employees. DON'T USE THIS SERVICE. There are much better alternatives."
"Don‚Äôt even get me started. Why do you charge for express post shipping if you can‚Äôt even get an item at its destination in 4 days? It‚Äôs friday and now I have to wait until Monday for a package that would have been ordered a week ago. I‚Äôve ordered countless times from this exact location and I know the route usually only takes a couple days..... these delays really screw things up for people.

Honestly ridiculous. This isn‚Äôt the first, or second, or even third time this has happened. Bunch of overpaid, incompetent and lazy employees. You guys have one job. And you still can‚Äôt figure it out. Canada Post is by far the worst mail service and it sucks that I‚Äôm basically forced to use it because I place orders online quite frequently. FIGURE IT OUT."
"I sent 12 parcels to UK at a cost of $1000 NONE have arrived in UK Undamaged, 5 have yet to be delivered.

As of today 18/10/ 2022. I have had no word or responce from either Canada Post or British parcel post.good customer relations dont you think"
"Refuses to stop delivery of missaddressed mail, or even bother to fix the law that they created in order to force people to take old tenant mail. I might need to get checked into a psych ward due to the stress, it is 100% the reason I'm on antidepressants."
I wish if i can not put any star for it ! What a scammer!!! Paid 20$ for fast shippement to get the silver dust by today as i have an order to be done with it today !! And when i called the estimated date is the 17 th which is the regilar shippement date .üòùüòùüòùdiscusting service what a scammers really really disappointed and will never ever use it again
"It has been almost 2 months, but my package is not delivered yet, which was suppose to deliver in 7 business days. Not getting any help even from customer care. Lost all my important stuff. One of the worst services. I pay you, i gave u the authority of my package and u show no responsibility. I was not even told that this package does not have tracking number. Only packages which has tracking number are delivered others not. They are showing zero responsibility. Im totally helpless. Package is in your hands, at one of your location then how can't you track that. If that is the problem then u must stop untrackable service or start telling people that this is not going to deliver. Totally disappointed and never going to use canada post in future nor my friends and nor my family."
"I've always used Canada post for my parcels but this time I am really disappointed with their services. I sent a parcel two months ago and it never got delivered and it neither came back to the sender's address. If a package is not trackable, does that mean you guys have no accountability ? Really? You should inform customers beforehand, that if the package is non-trackable it is never going to get delivered!!!!! Such high prices and so low responsibility.
Called the customer service thousand times as it was an important package and no one helped. They just said ""Go for trackable option next time"" . Seriously??? Thank you Canada post for such amazing services.
I will never recommend it to anyone."
"Won't even try. Gives up at even fulfilling it's own advertised times. Parcel sat alllllll day in the town half hour down the road, because they had already given up trying to deliver it before it even left it's destination, via a pushed back expected delivery date.

Lazy, too many elderly people. Hire some young blood, we need jobs."
I paid for express shipping and my package was worth $140 C. It‚Äôs been a week and I‚Äôve went to all measures with a claim and even leaving a note in my mailbox stating I‚Äôm missing a package. The item has a tracking number and says it arrived in my mailbox but again it‚Äôs been a week and the costumer service is unhelpful to me. Basically saying to wait it out but I have now paid for a new item I needed for double the price. So in the process of the mailman perhaps putting it in the wrong box has cost me way more than I can afford. Thank you Canada post! I will be using fed ex now.
"I dealt with Jennifer at thePugwash Canada Post on a Friday at 1700 hrs. Closing time.
She provided me with fantastic respectful friendly service and told me not to worry that it was closing time. Very helpful and solved my issue in no time.
We need more Jennifer‚Äôs

Thank you again,
Chris"
"Horrible service I've been wait for a package that says was supposed to be here and nothing for a couple of days. Plus i moved over a month ago and my mail forwarding has still not shown up.
Thabks canada post i wish i could give you negative stars !!!!"
"""We are busy right now"" is the answer when I call them from 10am-6pm."
"UPDATE - (01/10/18)

From a chinese company off EBay:
""Hi, thank you for your purchase.
Your ******** have been packaged and will be forwarded tomorrow.
WIth Canadia Inbound shipments is a hit or miss.
SOmetimes customers receive their orders in 10-18 days but some it takes even 1 month to 1,5 months.
Canadian post is really slow and I'm surprised how you can even tolerate such horrendous situation with you postage system.

In case that you don't want to risk such long delievery times please let us know and we will refund all of your money (cancel your order).
Please let us know.
Thank you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a couple years and several complaints I've reported my dope smoking mailman spending inordinate time during work hours with a drug dealing and very hostile immigrant on our street.
This mailman has been damaging the contents of my parcels, and/or leaving them in my recycle box, which get covered by newspapers and the box gets dumped every couple or 3 weeks, and withholding mail to deliver in bunches once a week, some being bills delivered late and overdue.
On one dumping I found a few parcels I thought were never delivered,
This mailman was off for personal reasons for 7 months and a new mailman delivered everyday, would knock on door to hand parcels over, not one damaged parcel and received mail everyday. Even the junk mail CP resorts to.
Then, the one day, the dope smoking mailman returns, on a ""graduate work return"" program, and after not one damaged parcel in the 7 month absence, he delivers another damaged package/parcel.
Received a follow up call from my complaint on this again damaged parcel from a Canada Post ""supervisor"" who I reiterated my list of complaints over the years to and requested he be removed from deliveries or monitored.
She (super) basically said there's nothing she can do because he ""owns that route"" and that Canada Post often damages mail and parcels.
W T F?
""He owns a federal mail delivery route?
""Canada Post often damages mail and parcels?""
WOW.
A federal Canadian Taxpayer funded mail system with no or little disciplinary actions on rouge and/or unprincipled mail ""peoplekinds"" Canada POst employees.
But she did say she'll inform him of my complaint.
Juz phuckin great.
Now this unprincipled rouge mailman is at liberty to do whatever he chooses to with my mail and claim ignorance.
Blind crippled monkees could run a better show.
Avoid Canada Post if you want don't want to risk your mail going missing or damaged. UPS and Federal Express take pride in their personnel and deliveries.
----------------------------------
UPDATE
After reviewing all these ""1"" star reviews of deplorable Canada Post managers and delivery personal, and a few ""suspect"" ""5""star reviews, I have concluded the toxic cesspool of incompetent unprincipled miscreants stealing wages from Canadian Taxpayers must be shut down.
$2 billion a year of bloated salaries/wages and financial losses incurred every year for the last 2 decades clearly indicates a government bureaucratic failure, which must be owned and accounted for.
- - - - - -
""Unclaimed: The company has not claimed their profile and we do not have information that they are actively collecting reviews.
- - - - - -
Not surprised Canada Post has not signed up for their Another Epic Fails Award"" that this country and current government deserves.
ALAWAY always seek other delivery services other than Canada Post.
Canada Post will always guaranteed to disappoint and disrespect you everytime."
"Made to wait over a month for a refund only to be told that because it was due to bad weather they couldn't deliver the package. It was mid April and there was no bad weather on that specific week. What a joke. Second time this happened to me, they charge an arm and a leg with the promise of 24 hour service only to deliver the package late and come up with fake excuses to keep your money."
"I've been using Canada post for quite some time being a heavy online shopper, and I'm disappointed to say I've stopped buying items that are being shipped via canada post. Canada post has one of the most DISRESPECTFUL customer service employees I've ever seen.
TWICE already I have went to my towns Canada post and have had to literally fight a battle to get my packages after the woman there repeatedly placed the wrong notice card in the wrong box and refused to give me the package even if the address on the package matches my government issued I.D.

Tried contacting Canada post on the phone to get these issues resolved, and the guy there hung up on me halfway through me explaining my issue. I am so over Canada post and will not ever recommend or use it ever again."
"Why is CanadaPost still being around? The blatant lack of any elementary respect for its customers should have driven them to bankruptcy so they can learn a well deserved lesson.Their government subsidized flawed business model is obsolete and their service is simply awful.
Before begging for money teach your employees how to do their job, teach them how TO DELIVER the packages.It's not rocket science, ring the bell hand over the package. Is it too much to ask from the national postal service??"
"Had my delivery stolen first time. For the second time, I asked that it be delivered to a Canada Post outlet at Fairview Mall, Toronto.

I received an email with the barcode for the pickup and took my OHIP card for ID. The agent at Canada Post then asked me for a physical copy of the barcode which never came in my mail (this is after she scanned the barcode on my phone so I don't know why there was a requirement of a physical copy?!), she then asked for a utility bill (which had to be a printout, the agent didn't accept an online bill) on top of my ID.

Nowhere was it mentioned in the email that I'm supposed to show utility bills, let alone physical copies of it.

What a tremendous waste of time."
"Have left a complaint about a delivery woman failing to successfully do her job. She has been putting mail in the wrong box since she started and has even given me someone else's mail because, ""she forgot to deliver it"", and asked me to take it back for her. I found this incredibly unprofessional, and made a point to let someone know. After getting a service ticket and told I would get a response a week later, I received nothing. So I waited before calling back myself to find out it had been completed and she had ""likely"" received coaching. But yet nothing has changed at all, which is why I called. We can notice the difference when she is not making the deliveries, like getting our mail earlier and there not being any mistakes of people's mail ending up in someone else's mail box.
It's seems I will be making many more complaints in the future sadly."
"Customer service rep was abhorrently rude. Talked me in circles, offered no real help, and hung up abruptly. Horrible experience and unpleasant person."
"""Reliability"" and ""Canada Post"" should never be in the same sentence (with the exception of this one).

They NEVER deliver on time - my item was been sitting in my local sorting center since yesterday afternoon, and it STILL didn't make it onto the delivery truck today. This is a regular occurrence - are you KIDDING ME CP?

Delivery people CONSISTENTLY leave notices on doors without attempting to knock or ring the bell. I've actually seen a delivery person from my window leave a notice on my door without knocking. I ran after them and called them out - they were pretty embarrassed to say the least.

This company is INCREDIBLY unreliable, it's disgusting."
"My father had to complain to the person who works for the parcel pickup for 15 minutes, just to get my parcel, when I authorized my father's name in the delivery notice with signature to pick it up for me."
"I have a package that has been stuck in ""customs"" for over a month.

I have called CBSA and Canada Post both and they both are unreliable to helping me solve my issue. I have been constantly given the run around on my package with NO new information on how it can be released or how I can just get the package I paid a lot to get shipped from Japan to Canada for."
"ordered from Amazon. I live in a condo. My phone rings, girl says its Canada Post, I say great do you want me to come down, she says no. I wait 15 min no one come to my door. I go down to the lobby, and there is a card in my box with instructions to go to a drugstore to pick it up the next day. Back of card has boxes to indicate why delivery not completed, nothing is ticked off. I complain to the clerk at the drug store and directly to Canada Post. They are no help. I let Amazon know who agree to give me a credit as of today. Great company to deal with. Deliveyr to my door is why I used online shopping. All other orders were delivered to my door. I am in a wheelchair and getting out is a problem for me. Plus I paid the delivery charges. I advised Amazon that I would not be placing future orders as delivery to my door can not be guaranteed. Hope they terminate Canada Post and I am sure they must be a huge customer."
"Multiple times I've tried to use ""express post"" and every single time it takes at least 5 days. I don't understand how they can say they guarantee anything as there is no accountability for when they do not deliver your items on time. Please do not use Canada Post if you need a parcel delivered for business or time sensitive reasons."
"The most useless delivery service, I get packages delivered every couple weeks and they come from the same place but always take different amount of days to get here and if you want to track your item that's pointless too because they don't do any updates sometimes for days, leaving you wondering where the hell your package is! just terrible service"
"Express post says 2 day delivery, try 5 while in canada, absolutely the worst service in canada to use unless your prepared to wait or have packages go missing."
Horrible customer service if you can even call it that. For such a large company they fail to train their delivery staff who time and time again are too lazy to deliver the package and instead claim the recipient was not home. Canada post also has a rating of .5/10 stars so no surprise here.
Just because they were too lazy to deliver the package they quickly left the ‚Äúnotice card‚Äù so I can go pick it up at post later and left. Didn‚Äôt even bother coming to the door to give me my package. I wish I could give 0 stars
"Convenient delivery or easy pick-up. There‚Äôs always an outlet nearby. FedEx is hell, Canada Post is heaven."
"My rating is actually negative 10 stars
Part 1 - delivery fail, delivery notice in mailbox with a hand written note admitting their error "" Sorry went to door forgot card"". After a few days I clued in that I will have to go an pick up my item. So I called to log a complaint. This leads me to ......

Part 2 - I call and the person doesn't even grant me a chance to be heard. ""Regardless, you will have to pick up your item"" ""The delivery person is not required to go pass the first floor, it's their discretion"" - why even put a note. I've never had this problem before and it's not the first time I've made this same order. ""It's unfortunate you have to pick up your order"" Yeah, it is!!!

I hand to end the call, total waste of my time."
"I wish I could give it zero or even minus star. They lost my parcel and did not answer my online complain. I called several times and representatives gave me inconsistent and extremely unhelpful generic responses. I paid for Xpresspost with the understanding that my item will reach in 2 business days.
What a lie!
3 weeks later and no one knows where a trackable item is. This delay is very costly for me. If I chose Xpresspost it means I needed my item to reach in 2 days.
The most frustrating part is that no one at Canada Post cares about the customer! Very incompetent!"
"Worst service ever. I wish I could give it less than one star.

I order a lot of products online. Canada Post keeps delivering my packages to someone else.

They are supposed to be getting signatures for package receipt and I wait at home and what do they do? They don't even come to my door - they put my expensive items in the community mailbox!

For example, last package (worth $200) went to my neighbour three doors down; lucky that they were honest and brought it to me.

This time it's a mobile phone (worth $400). I'm waiting all morning for a delivery to my door. I get an email message my package is waiting in my community mailbox! Get there, nothing. I call Canada Post - they won't do anything - is it too much to call the deliverer and ask where the package went? Doubt I'll ever see it. Now it's a huge hassle to call vendor and they have to issue ticket for Canada Post to follow up. My credit card is charged so I am out the $$$ but nothing to show for it. It will take weeks to resolve.

When we had permanent Canada Post staff working on our route delivering door to door we knew them by name and there was never a problem. They brought in part time contractors and community mailboxes and the service has never been worse. Disgusting."
"Have mailed 80 packages in the past year with only one problem where the prelabeled package wasn't scanned on entry at my local post office. Human error. Package arrived at destination 10 days later; should have been one day.

Have received about 100 packages from the US, Europe and other parts of Canada in the past year. For some reason there seems to be the occasional problem of packages from the UK taking a long time to reach me. I don't know whether this is the fault of Canada Post or Canada Customs, and I don't know why it seems only the UK is affected."
"Were it not for a legally enforced monopoly, these glorified couriers would have to compete with private companies that are doing a far better job for less. Abolish Canada Post."
"Extremely disappointed, angry and shocked at the terrible service. Amazon and UPS manage to deliver packages successfully and on time - why does Canada's primary postal operator not seem to value their customers?

After being guaranteed two day shipping with Xpress post, 7 days later I'm informed my item has been returned to the sender because ""they don't read the notes"" on orders, so the details of my address were lost to them. I understand it is complicated, but so many other postal services seem to manage just fine. Customers pay for two day shipping out of urgency, and I have been let down by Canada Post."
"Every time a package has to go through Quebec it's doomed...I know if Quebec shows up on tracking to expect my package at least 2 weeks late if it ever arrives. I don't have this problem for parcels shipped within the provinces (BC), but Quebec... not sure what system they are using."
"Absolute garbage. I have ordered xpresspost and the package came 3 days late and 2 days later than if I had paid for just regular mail... The customer representatives can't do ANYTHING for you at all because the sender has to do it.

I have been forced to use this service my whole life and its the worst of any country I have ever lived in or visited."
"Normally I have never got any problem with their service but just got one this time. 4 days ago we got a delivery notice so went to pick it up, however a lady in a counter said you already received the parcel. We ordered 2 items on Amazon at one time, then we only got one of them at that time so expected to pick up the other one. My husband just kept asking her for checking and there it was! There WAS our parcel.
Same thing happened today. Another delivery notice arrived yesterday, so I went to pick it up. Another lady on the counter said you already received the parcel, so I said that's not possible. Same thing happened last weekend, could you please just check? Then she tried explaining with frustrated that she was right because she's been working for 27 years there and it happened sometimes that getting a delivery notice right after receiving an item. She showed me that a parcel number matched to the paper my husband had signed on the previous parcel, and the numbers matched, so I left.
Now what I'm concerning is whether it was really the one we'd already got. Plus, if each parcel has each different number for sure?
Aren't they able to check on line correctly if a parcel has been delivered or not?

I hope that makes sense. Thanks to them, I got the worst day ever after moving to Vancouver."
TRASH LITERLY
Has not delivered mail to our neighbourhood for two days! We live in a city so it's not like we are out in the country where they might have an excuse. Waiting on an important letter and seriously not impressed!
"Received a Delivery Notice on 5/25 indicating that they were unable to deliver the package but provided me with information on where/when to pick it up. I was told that it would be ready for the following day after 1pm. When I arrived at the Post Office to pick it up, I was told they didn't have the package and that it would be here on Monday after 1pm (despite the notice card indicating otherwise).

Monday (5/28), I arrive at the Post Office after 1pm and am told, nope, sorry, we don't have the package, please come back after 1pm tomorrow. I was livid and asked to file a complaint and was provided with a number to call, which I did. After the complaint was filed, I was told that it would take up to 5 business days for someone to contact me.

What is the point in paying extra to have an item shipped faster, if they don't promise on their delivery. This was a suit that I had purchased and it requires alterations. I already had to cancel my Monday appointment with the tailor, who wasn't happy that I cancelled on the same day. I tried to explain to him the situation, but he told me not to call him until I had the suit in hand.

Very frustrating that there is no accountability from Canada Post's end. All we get is, oh, sorry...yes, I understand your frustration. Bullcrap has to end.

Almost on a weekly basis, my neighbors and I gather to 'trade' for each other's mail because the mail person can't read the address correctly. Our daughter's graduation photos were delivered folded into my mailbox despite the envelope clearly marked DO NOT FOLD in large red letters in multiple places on the envelope. I confronted the mail person and was told sorry, too many letters to look at instructions on each one.

There needs to be a higher level of accountability within Canada Post."
"I was using their online parcel registration option because it‚Äôs cheaper and faster and, as I thought, more convenient. But. I dropped my item on the post office on 125 the Queensway, toronto. The worker said it‚Äôs just fine to put my item there in the table. As it turned later, the item was never registered and delivered.
I was contacted the customer service, they opened a ticket and... Canada post is not liable of the items which were not scanned.
I contacted the Toronto region supervisor, asked to reveal security cameras records to find out what happened to the item and who‚Äôs going to pay for my lost. She lied to me that she watched the records (not knowing the location, time and place!) did not see anything there.
Hate Canada post. Regret that it‚Äôs the only one option which we have here in Canada."
"Absolutely unreliable and trash. The delivery man/woman didn't leave a parcel key for my package, which had my dress in it for a wedding. I spoke to a few people on the phone in customer service; the most they could do for me was to place a service ticket. I even suggested I come down to get the parcel key myself since this package is so important but nope, that was not an option.

I think Canada Post needs a better system for delivering packages and if events like this occur, there should be a quick solution to the mishap that is caused by THIER employees, maybe an on-call service which can deliver the key so that people (like myself) aren't sitting here without a dress to their best friend's wedding.

I have the wedding tomorrow and no dress. Unfuckingbelieveable and absolutely disappointing. Never again will I ever have anything delivered by Canada Post. Having the package left on my doorstep is much safer than relying on Canada Post's bad service."
"My neighbourhood V5e4e1 get change the mail man. And since then they never try to deliver the package, even the very small one. Just put the note to go pick up the at the local office...."
"Wish I'd read reviews before making the same mistake of trusting them with a package. Too lazy to carry the package to the door? Watched as he left truck without the package in his hand, delivered a card instead. Paid extra to require signature. NO ATTEMPT TO EVEN RING THE BELL!! Since physically unable to pick up the package from post office they are returning IT to sender without reimbursement for the original shipping charges!! IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO DELIVER DON'T ACCEPT PAYMENT TO DO SO!! THAT'S THEFT/FRAUD!!"
"Parcel delivery is crap....live in a large apartment building with cubby postal boxes (locked). Had a parcel delivered to me and postie just left a note where to pick it up..I am retired with mobility problems so getting to the assigned post office is difficult. All they had to do was ring my controlled entrance buzzer and I would have met them in the lobby....Is this company policy?, A lazy post person? Or just an asshat. Where is the compassion and customer service....From now on it will be a delivery service and hope that one day the post will be taken over by a private company and the miserable postal employees sent packing."
They are straight up lairs. They lost my package and lied to me and said the tracking information was wrong and that my item was out for delivery. It was not. I still do not have it. It is medical marijuana. So I now have to call the police
"Be warned if you expect your medication to be delivered in one day even though you pay for one day delivery service
I received a note saying to pick up my delivery tomorrow (Saturday). I on Saturday I was told that somehow my delivery is still in Cambridge and that I can expect it delivered on Tuesday after long weekend. I do not recommend using Canada Post service is you expect a professional service."
"Rediculous service, had a package due for delivery today, apparently the postman did not even try too deliver it, left a note too go pick it up from my local post office, when I called my local post office I was told I would be able too pick up my package since it was there! Well guess what...walked half an hour to go retrieve my package, I get there only too be told that it is indeed not there..what in the actual hell??? Absolutely terrible service. My package has been in town three days already and it's nowhere to be found..."
Worst service I have ever had!!! They say my item was delivered but it doesn't tell me where it was delivered. This is the third time this has happened. If you have sent this package to a local postal office then say where that is! I have had nothing but headache from this company.
"Astounded by the way a recent complaint was dealt with by Kevin Zimmermann an Area Supervisor with Canada Post. Unprofessional, unhelpful and rude Post Mistress in Indian Head Post Office led me to call Customer services, extremely helpful staff there advised me to use an authorization form to deal with the issue I had, long story short ended up with 2 customer service calls, 2 in person visits to the post office in question and 2 phone calls from Mr Zimmermann, outcome - I was told that when the 'Authorization Letter' - an official legally binding document states ""The individual must be an authorized representative listed above ..."" according to Kevin, that isn't what it means, it means someone who was authorized previously, he has no idea why it says that but that isnt what it means???? Seriously?? It appears this is only the opinion of Kevin and the Post Mistress from Indian Head as the other 5 post offices I called all interpret the form as any normal literate person does. Amazing how the written word will be twisted to suit, as someone who deals with legally binding paperwork on a daily basis I am blown away by the way this guy tried to lie this situation away."
"The Worst Postal Service
They are the absolute worst at delivering packages internationally and within Canada. Unreliable, lose packages constantly, no tracking internationally,. I had a international package delivery to Canada paid 30$USD ""it came to Canada in 3 days but took 78 days for Canada Post to deliver it from airport transit which is afew kilometers away from my house..! And this wasn't the only time or couple of times this is pretty much how they deliver international packaging..! I use to live in 3rd world country that still delivering with motor bikes and bicycles and I use to receive my package from other side of the planet less then 2 weeks..! Canada Post has no respect what so ever for other international post and mail companies around the world..! What I do now is what ever I need I ORDER IN WINTER so I probably receive it by Summer..!! ABSOLUTELY TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT TO THE NATION OF CANADA..!"
"2nd worst postal services in the world.
Only Italy has a worse postal service.
For Canada Post many items just never arrive. The items which do arrive are always very late.
The management are solely interested in boosting their own salaries, such as CEO: Deepak Chopra who receives $5million per year and yet has not even installed barcode scanners to track most packages!
When contacting Canada Post, you only get lies and excuses. Pathetic.
Always a very bad and unacceptable experience."
"Worst postal service anywhere. I had an item shipped express post from BC to Alberta and it‚Äôs now a week late plus the tracking says it‚Äôs still in BC. The customer service is absolutely horrible,I ended up hanging up on them for being ignorant morons. I will do everything I can to avoid using their crap service"
Canada post Is the worst way u can send mail in Canada probably the hole world. They make unions look bad I‚Äôve dealt with them numerous amounts of times and every time I felt I should of just drove to China and got my package myself useless!!!!! Canada post should not be aloud to use Canada in its name because this company doesn‚Äôt represent anything that Canada represents.
"Every single time I get a parcel delivered, if we're not home (or even if we ARE), they some times either just ring once and then leave the parcel in the lobby.... completely unsecured and unattended. Or for small parcels, they put them a lot of times in the wrong mailbox..... I live in an apartment building with only 12 units....

Oh and those parcels in the lobby? If we weren't home, by the time we did get home, parcel gone (most likely stolen) What happened to leaving it to the nearest post office in case it wasn't delivered?

We've complained numerous times but no cigar."
"Worst customer service ever at Jackson Square postal service! The young ladies that work there are courteous and helpful, but the two guys (I think they're the managers) are useless, condescending, and are the absolute worst!"
Canada Post sucksÔºÅ
"Love my postal carrier. Friendly and never leaves packages out to be seen.
Seem to be lucky my packages make it to me and where they are going on time"
"I have ordered nearly 200 packages on Amazon and Ebay over the years. Every single package delivered by FedEx, UPS, and Purolator were on time. Every single package delivered by Canada Post was at least one day late, usually 2 or 3. I guess that's just the government for you..."
"Was suppose to get my parcel yesterday,but as usual i get this notification ''Verifying recipient's address; Possible delay'', because its Canada fuking Post that can't do a single thing right. So today i come to my 2nd house again today located in Quebec to pick up my parcel at the door and i get a delivery notice in the fuking mail box saying that the man passed by at 9:30 and no one answered the door. I've been here since 8 in the fuking morning, i haven't heard any fuking bell ring or my door knock and now i have to come back again tomorrow to pick up my parcel at the local Canada Post store.

I FUKING HATE THIS CANCEROUS COMPANY AND I HOPE ALL THE LAZY FUKING WORKERS FUKING DIE OF CANCER !!"
"I got scammed on the internet and had to stop the shipment before it reached the scammer. I called them for three days continuously asking for help. They told me to go to police, I did. I even have me the file number at the anti fraud centre. They said they would keep my parcel on hold. The next day i see that it was prcessed and reached international. Mind you i was calling for three days and all this time the package was in the office next to my house. Did not let me pick it up. And then when i called to ask them why was it processed , the very rude supervisor who I dont think gives a damn abt customer just told me blantly that the package went international, they wont be able to stop it. And they were the one who told me that the package was on hold just the previous day!! WORST CUSTOMER CARE I HAVE EVER SEEN. Employees say different things everytime i call. Never received my parcel back. It went to the scammer."
Too lazy to deliver your package. I will never send my package by Canada Post again. :(
"If I could give Canada Post ZERO STARS, I WOULD!

1. They placed my 500$ package on the wrong doorstep - Did not even bother taking the time to verify the house number. Isn't that your job? To make sure packages make it to the CORRECT addresses. When I called customer service, I got the WORST SERVICE. She told me there was nothing she can do and that I'd have to contact the vendor!!! Her closing statement was ""LETS HOPE YOU HAVE HONEST NEIGHBOORS"". WHAT?!

2. I ordered a package again recently from a different vendor and it was out for delivery. Two hours later, for no f****** reason, it said ""sent back to vendor"" for incomplete address. I called Canada Post and the vendor, they both had the CORRECT address. Not even a suite or apartment number, ITS A HOUSE on a residential street!!! Plus, customer service told me there's nothing they can do once the label is generated. WHAT!?

Will never use Canada Post personally and hope vendors stop as well.

- One really angry customer."
"I just had the worst customer service. I had to call the french customer service because I ordered a packet from South Korea, and thanks to the tracking number, I could follow the parcel. It finally arrived in Montreal on the 1st of May, but on the 4th of May there was an update: ""Location: KRSELB""; ""Description: International shipment has arrived in a foreign country.""
Seeing this, I wanted to call to see if my parcel has been delivered to another country. However, the man with whom I spoke to talked to me like I was ignorant, telling me that the parcel came from Korea so it ""obviously"" takes more time and that there are no deliveries on the weekend. He failed to understand what the problem was, and insisted that my parcel just arrived, which is not true if I check with the tracking number. He then mockingly asked me why I bothered to call if that wasn't the problem. I'm not complaining about how long it is going to take to arrive, I just wanted to assure that my parcel wasn't delivered to another country, as stated by the tracking number. If I misunderstood, he could've just explained what the description of the parcel meant, instead of being rude.
I also work in customer service and this call has been the most disappointing one yet. I haven't been rude, but the employee talked to me like I was too stupid to understand. I never write bad reviews but this time I'm seriously disappointed."
"garbage delivery, got 3 items delivered by them and all three were delivered to the wrong house or they just didn't knock"
"Terrible service, I just can't believe that people still using their service."
"Canada Post does not stand by their own policies for delivery, my house is within 500m of the community boxes, yet they never ever attempt to deliver a package, instead they only deliver a notice card to my community box."
Terrible company. I've been waiting for my package for a week despite paying 2 day shipping and even when I go to the post office they tell me to wait till the next day. This is not the first time this has happened.
Went in to pick up a package for my boyfriend (as he goes to work before they open and after they close ) she wouldn‚Äôt let me pick it up even though we live together and both our names in on the mailbox and I have my own key and many other times I was allowed to pick up things for him. So she started yelled at me and said that‚Äôs the rules I said fine and walked out to my car. I called the same store talking to a different employee and he allowed me to come back in and pick it up with no problem at all which is great but no consequences were made for her actions nor did she apologize for her actions. UNACCEPTABLE.
"We asked post canada to get their fastest delivery service (2 or 3 days international delivery). Instead they sold us the 4 to 7 days international delivery. As we trusted the agent we didn't check we received the proper delivery service we needed. When we noticed the mistake, we went back to post Canada. There, they didn't manage to figure out how to change the type of delivery. Then, they checked on their computer and swore that regarding the destination the delivery would be received in 2 days anyways. 4 days later, it still not arrived. Worst service ever."
"I expected a parcel today (april 26,2018 at 1615 Bloor St, mississauga) from my amazon order.i badly needed the item on time so i was literally at the door the whole time waiting for canadapost, at the same time tracking the status online. suddenly i received a notification online that a delivery was attempted and that a notice was left at my door. wow! pure dishonesty! there was no delivery attempt, no notice left. canadapost needs to revisit their commitment to do their job."
"This is the most unhelpful, unreliable and disorganized company. I‚Äôd give it a negative score if I could."
For some reason what everyone else seems to get in two days I get in four. On top the mail guy shows up at 4:30 pm on a business day. I live in DOWNTOWN Victoria on Quadra Street ...not Fort Nelson. Canada Post is the worst.
Why can I not pick less then one star. To parcels by express post in the last month and both have been lost and not delivered on time. Posted one today and it took 12 hours to go 12 KM. The same day I posted it the tracked told me that it was going to be delivered a day late. I do not think they know what the word guarantee means.
"Canada post could not deliver an urgent package from Langley to Vancouver. Worse, they blamed me for having the wrong address when I did not. Worse still their customer service line told my sender they would re-send it and did not. I ended up having to obtain it elsewhere over a week later and they have taken 0 responsibility. If you want to be treated terribly and have a high likelihood of losing your package, try Canada post."
Canada post is garbage .my packages still sitting at canada posts since last year November. And even if I do get my parcels either it's opened and things missing from inside.I do lots of online order.don't understand tracking says it's at surrey should be out for delivery but I don't get it.looks like someone stealing things at canafa posts.
"Terrible courrier service. I've seen some else on here complain that they don't get their mail, that they just leave a delivery notice slip. Well I've had the same issue, and Canada Post informed me, something that is not transparent and I don't think many customer service representatives will tell you, is that if you live in a building above the second floor, Canada Post has a ""step mandate"" that their employees only have to take a certain amount of steps. Therefore, meaning, if you live above the second floor, you're out of luck; all they are obliged to do is leave you a notice. I would strongly encourage you to CALL and COMPLAIN, because I was informed that if there is enough complaints about this, they will change policy. I've never had any problem with any other courrier service (ex. UPS, FedEX), why is there such a ridiculous mandate for Canada Post. PLUS, these employees drive around all day, SITTING ALL DAY, how in the world does it make sense that they then would have a step mandate. NONSENSE!"
"website doesn't work and gives me an error, so i type in the error code to the help menu and it prompts me to call there number, waited 1.5 hours, no answer. try help online, tells me to call at the end of all the prompts. again, no answer. really frustrating wasting time on this"
"Over an hour on hold to get help with mail forwarding?!!! And RUDE when I finally did get someone on the phone. I went directly to the post office first and they couldn‚Äôt have been less interested in helping. They just wrote down the toll free number and that was it...
Incredibly frustrating service from an organization that has stopped mail service (or threatened to) to demand wage increases - for what?!!!"
They‚Äôre too lazy to deliver to your door every time they leave delivery notice and never deliver to my door!
"What is wrong with this Canadian Postal Service?? They can‚Äôt seem to get anything right anymore, I was told by their service rep. that my postal P.O. box doesn‚Äôt even exist, or he could not find it, he then ask me if I was name name which is my wife, so I asked him where he got that name from, he replied that it was the only name associated with the PO box number, now I have a problem with personal information breach plus I have no idea where my shipment is, so now the person who sent the money is the only one being inconvenienced. Generate a tracking # and wait for them, nothing but a waste of time, money, & energy, the only ones that get satisfaction from this is the foreigners that work there who can‚Äôt speak ENGLISH!!!!"
"Claimed to have delivered my package to my community mailbox. No package in my personal mailbox, nor was there a key left to access the larger communal package compartment of the community mailbox. I called Canada Post to inquire about this and the lady on the phone was rude and basically told me I was SOL. Since the package claimed to have been delivered she said the mail carrier had done their job and that I'd have to contact the company who shipped out my package.
Canada Post, you had one job. How hard is it to properly deliver a package? As for customer service... useless."
"Canada post NEVER delivers to my apartment door despite the fact that there is always someone home. No attempts are ever made, no calls were ever made for me to come downstairs, nothing. I have to pick it up at my local postal office. I am paying for delivery fees not paying to pick it up else where. I called Canada post to request to delivery to my door, got denied. Other shipping companies are better, for example UPS."
They are the worst company have ever encountered. They are useless and they lie a lot about making attempts to deliver your orders which they never did. I‚Äôll never recommend them to anybody. That‚Äôs what Royal Mail in the United Kingdom will never do.
Canada Post is the worst!!!!!! It is the second time they mess up my order/package but this time they took the cake!!! They not only got my adddress wrong THEY DELIVERED MY PACKAGE TO THE WRONG ADDRESS!!! Some person signed t and stole my package!!!! What‚Äôs even worst is that the address they delivered t to doesn‚Äôt even exist but someone signed for it!! Are you serious??? FU Canada post!!! You dumb!!!
"Canada Post is horrendous. Xpresspost has NEVER been within 2 days delivery and I've ordered at least 10 or so items that were shipped using xpresspost. They will scan your item as ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù and then just not come to your house at all for potentially 1-3 days with zero accountability or consequences to anybody in the Canada Post workforce. They really just don‚Äôt care and are lazy. How about you just don‚Äôt advertise that you‚Äôll get it within 2 days or less? Because that guarantee is as good as crap. The funniest thing is when they come up to your house and knock 1-2 times then quickly run away so they don‚Äôt have to actually deal with people, what a joke. Can‚Äôt wait until this horrible business has finally collapsed, hopefully a competent business will take its place and instill a form of responsible and efficient postal services."
"This is an awful post.
very rude customer service.
with my tracking number my package supposed to arrive tomorrow; however, it arrived yesterday. It's heavy package for me to pick up and I don't have a car. Lady in a post office in Yonge and Finch (north York) is extremely rude. she was yelling at me. my husband is out of country right now but he called customer service number and he faced to very bad behavior.

Canada post is disappointing."
"I have to admit myself that i am living the same situation as many other mentioned here.

They simply do not attempt to deliver the frigging parcel and automatically leave a notice and i recorded that on CCTV numerous times. These lazy lubberworth are at 10 feet from the door and leave a notice in the mail box instead of DELIVERING THE PARCEL. The business is OPEN AND THERE IS ALWAYS STAFF AT THE RECEPTION. Now i have to go 26 km to get my things because they are too lazy to get out of their truck ?!?!?!?!

CANADA POST, WE ARE PAYING FOR DELIVERY !!!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ???

Instead of delivering their packages they waste time doing all these notices and they are lying because i receive on my amazon account that the postman left a notice at 8:32 and i have him on recording leaving his notice at 10:57 so they did not attempt to deliver because the guy made all his notices before leaving the office knowingly that he will not deliver any parcels and complete his route as fast as possible. Leaving all their customers with the trouble they paid to not have.

This is the most disgusting business practice i have ever seen in my life.

CANADA POST YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB.

Puro, UPS, Canpar, Intelcom.... they all get their freaking butts off their seats and do their job..... Intelcom they even call me on my cell to tell me that they are going to be there in 5 min....

IF THE PARCEL IS TOO HEAVY WE HAVE MUSCLES HERE, WE WILL HELP YOU !!!!!

JUST LET US KNOW THAT YOU ARE THERE, RING THE BELL, KNOCK ON THE DOOR,

DO YOUR F...... JOB.

If you are accepting this comportment from your employee or worst if you are encouraging it, you are breaking your business and it is a real embarrassment to use your parcel service because YOU don't deliver. YOU are F...... YOUR customers. Shame on YOU CANADA POST.

By doing so you are defeating the single purpose of your own existence. and that amaze me beyond everything."
"Awful customer service, incredibly slow delivery, nobody cares bout your package, as soon as they take your money they take on a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get it when you get it‚Äù attitude. Regardless wether it‚Äôs regular delivery or xpresspost"
"Terrible service, never receive packages properly, keys not left in mail box etc...... ridiculous... latest, is....Card left at 10:06 am... No delivery attempt was ever made, I was here at door. no card, no delivery attempt. Delivery person just put that in so they dont have to bother trying to deliver, this is just a long line of crap that I have been through. At the post office they rarely are able to process anything correctly, everything from scale not working to not sure how to charge customs fees. I have even had employees come to my house to read the fees, because they cant get it to register in there system. Ridiculous have no idea where package is, made complaint and I am sure will never hear a thing.....incompetence in every job"
"Sent Priority post within canada, they advertise SAME DAY OR NEXT DAY AND IT TOOK 8 F@#$%ING DAYS AND NO REFUND.

GARBAGE SERVICE"
"They provide unrealistic expected delivery times , they don‚Äôt update their system and they have no customer service it‚Äôs all automated through a ticket system because of how much s*** they used to get in."
Canada post has wronged me too many times. They are brutal.
Tracked a package & their site stated a delivery slip was left but nothing was actually left. I reached out to Canada Post through their Facebook page asking where to pick my package up (gave tracking number). But they didn't provide a pickup address. Chasing deliveries around because the employees don't want to do their job is not right. Service is the absolute worst. That's why I only ever use courier when I want packages delivered.
"MAIL A LETTER 1ST CLASS FROM EDMONTON TO CALGARY-WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE IN 2 DAYS,WEEK LATER STILL HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED.CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AND THEY GAVE ME A SERVICE TICKET NUMBER AND TOLD ME TO WAIT ANOTHER 14 DAYS-WHAT A JOKE!!! WILL NEVER SEND ANYTHING IMPORTANT THRU CANADA POST AGAIN."
My worse experience with Canada post. They cannot track your parcel when it is out for delivery. I am waiting for my parcel close to a week and they don't know where the parcel is. Status shows out for delivery. The staff was not helpful and pushed me to speak to the sender. The sender is telling me to follow up with Canada post. It was a cell phone. I don't have a cell phone for over a week. Parcel was coming from Mississauga. Someone at Canada post must have pocketed it. Thanks
"They are getting one star because that's the lowest I can give them. If it were up to me, they would get minus about one trillion.

Sent a time sensitive package out on March 21. Going from BC to Quebec. Was supposed to be delivered - at the latest - March 27. As of March 27, it was being returned to my address in BC. Why? Well, apparently clerks in BC cannot tell the difference between ""From"" and ""To"" addresses. Total run around from ""Customer Service"" - misnomer if there ever was one. DO NOT, repete, DO NOT send via Canada Post unless you do not care whether or not it reaches its destination. Fed Ex would be a way better option and I will for sure never use CP again.....ever."
Received a parcel in the mail. They left me the key to open the parcel box but it does not work. I called customer service and they said they will get someone within 3 days to check the lock. I went to the post canada central they said they will send someone over and they never came. It‚Äôs been 3 days and i feel like they are not doing anything to get this fixed. This parcel is very important but they still seem to not care. They told me eventually will get someone To drop off the good key but i don‚Äôt know when that day will be because it‚Äôs already been three.
"Post did not arrive to destination even if in Canada Post tracking# system shows as delivered. Customer Service I talk with could not give me any other info, just to put claim through, UNACCEPTABLE-UNPROFESSIONAL-VERY BAD SERVICE. We paid for it! My original paper came after over one week of delay!"
"the worst! Website very difficult to negotiate and file claim.Round and round we go! Once claim is filed and acknowledged, they say 2 days before someone will call to follow up-guess what-no call!What a surprise!And any problem is always the sender's fault, not Canada Post. Returned a parcel to Gap Canada, but it's been sitting in Misssissuaga for 16 days so far. Now I'm out the original purchase price plus postage.I will start dealing with them by phone tomrrow but don't expect any joy.Typical.Oh, don't bother to try to get an email contact for Corporate person responsible for customer service-they hide.No contact info available-how convenient."
"This compagny is bad, 45$ for a shipping and never arived to destination. Called them, and they cant do nothing. 2 times had this problem with this compagny. Never ship with this ...."
Had my mail sent back that had my debit card and RRSP statement
"Worst delivery ever, as a business we are now not getting our mail much later in the day, why? Call them and they every excuse in the book that you can imagine. Very disappointed in Canada Post service."
"Our Amazon account has been suspended because the Canadian postal service is so unbelievably unreliable. So many packages have gone missing or taken up to 2 months to be delivered.

Utterly awful!"
"Can someone please tell me why everytime there is a colourful envelope delivered the corner is opened. Suspicious how it never happens to a plain envelope. My daughter just recieved a letter from a friend with a picture inside, approximately the same size as a gift card.....suprise corner was opened again."
"I can see a lot people just want to complain but obviously there is not reason for that and i guess nothing better to do....carrier company is not responsible and they CANT control what,when and how senders running they own business...do not blame dhl,purolator post office if you order some product from all over the world...someone blame canada post because that person received package from hong kong 2-3 month later.... first of all ask your self WHEN sender prepare your item when did send...i had my self couple times situation that i was waiting long time for my parcel but at the end i did find true eBay that sender was lying regarding (they did not send on time)...do not be hateful just because is federal company.So far canada post is fastest cheapest and most reliable to send packages...thats so easy to confirm ..cheers"
"where to start.. Canada post has progressively gotten worse, i have had items take twice as long to arrive than that of two years ago, even when express shipping is paid for, i had one item that i had ordered from Hong Kong take 10 months to arrive it used to only take less than a month, now it seems to average 3 and no customs back log so they cant blame it on Canada Customs....Overnight courier from USA... arrived in Canada same day Canada post 3 days to deliver, no customs hold"
"I ordered 3 water filters for a fridge from Amazon, Canada Post are their carrier and this is their tracking number 4007693195783622

So far this is the magical mystery tour its taken, and the final destination should be CALGARY...

"So I gave the wrong address it took me a day to notice and call them, now it's been a week and nothing has changed. It's sitting in the same city as me, I can't pick it up. They can't give me info. They tell me an estimated date of deliver which should be mandatory with a tracking number. How hard is it to change an address and send the parcel out? They have the right address, they have for days yet they can't send it out to me. We need a new way to get mail because these people are ridiculous! They can't even do basic things that a monkey can do, I wish we could put these idiots out of business and get someone that actually deserves the money because they will do their job."
Always a problem with these people cleared customs processed 1st day sat around for 10 days processed again since then nothing took 3 days from Sweden to Mississauga.Better off hiring a homeless guy get him a bike give him the parcel and i'm sure he'd have better reviews than these morons
"Ordered an item from Amazon Prime. 48 hours turned into 7 days.
Canada Post goes above and beyond at incompetence. Takes UNRELIABLE to the next level. Ombudsmen Reference# 125149315"
"Worst service, I have a Parcel out for delivery for 4 days now! I tried phoning Canada Post and have to wait for long to talk to a customer service agent, guess what? I was just given the same info on the tracking page and they can't help me with my parcel whereabouts! Standard Delivery was 3 days, and it's been a week and no Parcel until now!!!! Poor service and won't recommend at all. Customer service agents just track it via site's tracking page and they won't help you for real. If I was working like this crazy idiot employees I won't have a job by now."
"Your tax dollars and after-tax dollars pay for the worst mail delivery option. The government forces you to use them, and they can't deliver a package without loosing it. In the even they do deliver something, it is usually faster to walk than to use Canada post. Calgary to BC will take 2 weeks to walk, Canada post takes 3 weeks."
"Hands down the worst delivery service, I have ever had to deal with. Late most of the time, never comes on the express day, horrible service I would rather pick it up from the wear house, then leave up to one of the incompetent losers to try and deliver it"
Your website is one of the worst I have ever seen! I can never log in properly to simply do a hold mail service. I would give you less than 1 star if I could.
Duties never seem as much as the other providers and my deliveries always arrive on time
"I am being trained at 280 Progress Ave for a week now. Bruno Brancaccio is the best trainer I have ever had without any exaggeration. This is coming from a trainer myself. I‚Äôve laughed so hard in his company like I did 18 years ago at university when we skipped classes and laughed with friends in the cafeteria oblivious of the fact that this would ruin our careers üôÇ. He trained me by the book, literally cared about the mail in his possession like it is his own. His customers literally love him and he knows them on a first name basis. And to top it all he gave me his personal number to call him even after the training if I get stuck with a problem. I even witnessed his previous trainees call asking questions on the process. Who does that? I just hope Canada Post utilizes his full potential for the growth of the company. And finally, you put your...! Inside joke."
"You thought UPS was bad.. Canada Post is worse. Canada Post is the bottom of the chain delivery service. You get better and faster shipping walking yourself to your destination. Customer service is usually useless. They will send tickets for you, but nothing will ever actually be done, because the other person on the other end will not follow up on your issue. I have lost my package completely before and had to go to the seller to order again. Canada Post not only is a hassle for the buyer but the seller as well when they lose packages during the transportation process. I advise sellers to choose other postal services as a default. It will save you the hassle of any of these issues and save you cost on replacing things for the buyer. Truly.. Canada Post is an utter joke."
"What has happened to Canada post home delivery? For longest time we had the same woman delivering our mail, in uniform and always saw her daily. Now I never see anyone delivering mail except a Chinese guy, who wanders down the street clutching mail at his chest, and can't speak English!. This guy wears no uniform and goes zig zagging down the street like a blind chicken. I am lucky to get any mail once a week. When we get mail now it is 80% wrong address. I would like to know what happened to the girl who was our regular delivery person and why is this guy hired who doesn't have a clue what he's doing? I am NOT racist but I want to know how this guy was hired when there are Canadians qualified and needing jobs!!!"
"What a horrible experience I have so far with Canada post, I forwarded my mail to my new address and never received any mail. I subscribed in July 2017 for one year and received only couple of mails then stopped.
I called customer service twice and didn‚Äôt succeed to have this resolved.
Useless service and a rip off."
"You call this a postal service?
Receive a delivery notice, but they are too lazy to deliver the actual package to the post office until the NEXT business day.
Receive a delivery notice on Friday? Too bad, you have to wait until Monday to actually pick it up. Absolutely nonsense. A pathetic national company."
"I had to keep my fingers crossed every time I send and receive packages by Canada Post. They broke two of my parcels in 6 months despite ample protection. (I have no idea how they managed it. They must have punt my packages into the truck). And they have a bad system of tracking the delivery of package to residential areas. One of the packages I sent is still stuck at ""Out for Delivery"". It's been a month now. I created a service ticket, but it is not helping.

While receiving packages, 80% of the time they scan my packages but leave them in the truck and send them to a post office nearby the FOLLOWING day. They never come up to my apartment. And recently, they don't even bother leaving a delivery notice card. Now I am forced to use FlexDelivery..."
The service is crap and way too expensive!!!! Why can't shipping costs be reasonable??? Stop with the monetary greed!!!! I just paid $18.00 to ship a very lightweight small packet envelope from Ontario to Alberta. Insane!!!!! That was the cheapest method!! Really??? If no stars was an option that's what I would have chosen for this rating. Canada Post is a rip-off company!!!
It's hard to figure why it takes Canada Post so long to deliver a package. Where we live it can be hard for a courier service to reach us in the winter so we have our Amazon packages shipped to the local post office where we will pick it up. Amazon Prime can and does deliver a package in two or three days. When Canada Post takes possession of our package it takes (without exaggeration) 11 days to deliver a small package to their local post office location. This is coming from a distance that can be driven in as little as 10 hours. No problem to tell it is a Government run institution.
"Canada Post don't even deserve one star. Absolutely awful, two packages shipped from Europe to Canada in December with tracking numbers have still not arrived. Canada Post has decided not to track registered mail and doesn't even provide delivery confirmation.

A truly shocking postal service, I ship to 70 countries around the world and none are as bad as Canada Post. I have great customers in Canada but sadly will have to stop shipping there. Shocking that a country like Canada can have a postal service that is not fit for purpose."
"My business certificate was returned to the sender. The envelope was marked ""moved or unknown"". When I complained to the supervisor of the Canada post (On 6th Ave North and McIntyre street Regina Saskatchewan). I got a very unprofessional response. He said mistakes happens. Today, again, I found out that my debit card was also returned to the sender. Don't know what to do?"
"Canada Post doesn't even deserve 1 star on this one.
I sent a 'small package' with no track number, since December 2017

The package has not arrive yet, I call the post office
and spoke to 4 different girls and they all are very good at repeating the same ""I'm sorry, I cannot help you any more if you don't have a tracking number""

**What kind of excuse is that , Canada Post doesn't take any responsibility for small packages.

They basically just take your money .

I trusted Canada Post with the package, and someone somewhere just took the package and kept it, and because there is no tracking number they know nobody is responsible for it.

They are very good at getting rid of the customers very efficiently when on the phone.

horrible , horrible , horrible services.

No wonder they have so many problems
I could not imagen myself working in a place like that."
The worst company ever too expensive and the are cheating us!! 78$ is the cheapest way to return a box that ways under 200 grams! There is no more tracked packet service in Canada to international destinations!! Canada post destroying Canada one piece at a time!!
"What is the point of tracking if it won‚Äôt let you actually track your packages?
Delivery person consistently leaves item at door when ‚Äòdon‚Äôt safe drop‚Äô is requested. They never ring the doorbell, just leave the package in full view for any criminal to see. We have had packages take many days beyond stated delivery date despite perfect weather conditions that otherwise would cause delays. Now, as far as possible I ask vendors to send by any Courier, except Purolator"
Horrible! Definitely the worst EVER in ANY business!!! Terrible! I would give them negative but unfortunately there is only one star option!!! The worst Ever! I am on the phone waiting for them for 2 hours and they tell me we can ask for 2-5 day shipping and the letter was Xpress regional which should have been here yesterday!!! I am speechless for their lack of response. Worst Ever! They have my Passport!!!
"Absolutely terrible! They have sent my package to three different provinces. Blew well passed expected delivery date. It's shown ""error in processing, delays are possible"" twice! It's literally gone back and forth between Richmond and Vancouver 4 times now. It was supposed to go to Ontario. It's currently back in Vancouver for some unknown reason. Not likely It will be delivered at all. Extremely frustrating."
"Order a laptop.
My payment goes through...
Next thing you know I track my package which arrived in Montreal and suddenly....return to sender to Ontario. I contact post canada, no reason can be given to me as to why suddenly the laptop I paid for is returned to sender. The cannot track the package nor can they call the distribution center. They have and I quote ""no way of having out going calls to the distribution center"" so I asked ""So what you're telling me is that you cannot call, email, skype, whatsapp,google meet the distribution center?"" ""Yes"" Are you serious? This is the 3rd time Post Canada screws up my packages in a single year. THIRD TIME and every time there is absolutely no way of knowing why. So I asked...can they not keep it there and I go pick it up??? Nope. This is why I always select fed ex, ups, dhl or any other than post canada. Something always happens and they're never held accountable. And that is excluding the 2 times they damaged packages. I sincerely you go broke. This is the single most useless posting service."
Bad customer service. Package not receive and was told to wait. Wait forever for nothing.
I will only order international items online if they are shipped by Canada Post only. Fedex and UPS charge outragous duties and taxes that are close to 30% of the value of the products. I ordered items from Europe and North America without paying high taxes with Canada Post and like the good service from Canada Post.
"Received yet another damaged parcel yesterday in the mail. The box contained a somewhat fragile item so the shipper wrapped it in lots of ""bubblelite"" plastic and then cushioned it with an excessive amount of newspaper padding on all 4 sides. Sadly the expensive item which was a gold plated, 150th anniversary telephone honouring AGB was broken in pieces. The box looked as if it had been kicked or punted as hard as it could be, displaying a large dent in one corner, when I retrieved it from my mail outlet. This is not the first time this has happened and it must stop! I hold my breath every time I order something that I know Canada Post will be delivering. The seller and myself are now out a lot of money, not to mention the time and effort. He had marked FRAGILE all over the box and THIS END UP with an arrow. What is wrong with people these days???? I'm sure this was a deliberate action by a CP employee. We pay big for their services and yet after all these years it seems to be just getting worse.
I have said it before and I'll say it again; ""We are regressing as a society"" and this is just one more example of that very fact. Terry Charter"
Another lost/delayed package. Twice in four months. Setting up a Flex Delivery has not mitigated this problem. Zero accountability from management with the issue is escalated. Snark/rude comments from the staff on the phone. Absolutely Ridiculous.
Canada post provides the lowest service I‚Äôve ever received in my life. They never deliver parcel on time and their work is seriously slow. YOU ARE GETTING PAID. WORK HARDER.
"They lose like 1/5th of my packages.. Especially from international sellers.

So far I'm missing 3 that should have been delivered in DECEMBER. When I contacted them on facebook, they never responded. Honestly the WORST mailing system I've EVER used and I feel anxious whenever I know they're who I'm stuck with ordering an item I really want.."
"The worst service , the mail man ring the bell and run to his truck in my drive way leaving a note in my mail box. I waved at the guy after I opened the door but he pretend he did not see me , it happened twice last week and this week . if there is zero star I will give it . Canada post is only good in delivering junk mail .
Other thing they dont check address , many times I received mail with wrong name and address.
Shame on you Canada Post."
"The worst. I used Xpresspost service to sent important documents and they were returned to my address after 4 days with no reason. Everything was ok, the address, name. Horrible experience with their customer service. My documents are still on its way."
Can't even knock at your door to deliver par el they just leave the slip every time bunch of lazy people
"International letter mail extremely unreliable. They have lost about 50% of my letter mail sent out in December 2017 and this is very expensive for a self employed business making a modest income. It isn't seeming possible to sell my work internationally as I can't rely on the postal service and for them to take any accountability, I must pay triple for a tracking number on a simple letter."
"In the past 5 years I‚Äôve have had about 10-12 expresspost packages go missing and about 1/2 of the ones I‚Äôve sent or received never gets there in the 2 day threshold. The claims department has no answers, and will sometimes take up to 3 months and maybe an appeal to get any resolution on the parcels. No responsibility for mail delivery, which is their job. This causes me lost time and funds as I‚Äôve got to do their job and find the parcel or replace the cost of shipping and the item. In person at the actual post office I find them very accommodating, and pleasant, this leads me to believe it‚Äôs not the people at the post office whom are incompetent, it‚Äôs the people managing it. So not only does the taxpayer foot the wages,pension,pay the postage, but must also do the footwork when they fail to deliver, literally."
"One time I ordered a time turner necklace for Christmas in the second week of December, and it was expected before Christmas. It arrived halfway through March.
It takes a week for some thing to get to Western Canada 7000 miles from Germany. It also takes a week for something to get 300 miles halfway across British Columbia (a seven hour drive). It takes two weeks for something to get here from the other side of the country. It takes two weeks from California. The post office is shut on Saturdays!! Everyone knows there's only no post on Sundays! THE POST OFFICE WORKER'S LUNCH BREAK IS TWO HOURS!! Not to mention that I'm pretty sure they're not open after 5 or before 9, so if you work 5 days a week 9-5 ...
The employment opportunities are bs. In order to get a job as a driver, you must have your own van, rather than, I dunno, Canada Post providing a POST VAN. Furthermore, you have to have a backup person for in case you're unavailable for a shift. And you can't sign up to be a backup driver, no, you have to already know them.
Sometimes your parcel gets stopped at customs for a week. You then have to pay like $9 for handling fees.
But if you combine CP with USPS, bloody hell. Not only will it take a month to get here, the postage costs are insane!
One time I wanted to buy a pin badge from America. It was $4 USD. The standard shipping was about $16. The faster shipping (one day faster): $45 USD
Very often when ordering from America, the postage is more than the actual product cost.
Canada Post is amongst the worst postal services in the world."
"Slow delivery, bad attitude, incorrect information on the delivery note. Any bs you can imagine could happen with them."
"Absolute nightmare dealing with Canada Post. They lost a firearm for 22 days and couldn't give me a single answer to where it was. Magically it turns up in the same city. Now a second firearm is unexplainabley missing yet again coming from Ontario to Alberta. And again they have no answer to where it is and that it left a city 3 hours away from us 4 days ago and it should have been here days ago. Where is it ? "" sir we are sorry we don't know and dont have an answer. I will never nor my family ever use Canada Post again."
Just like a blackhole where everything gets lost in it. Tracking number never works on their website but everywhere else in the world. Please fix it!!! Worst postal service in the world.
"Always taking forever. It's almost like you might as well not even pay for express posting or anything because they'll still take about a week to get anything to you. Never ever actually on the projected dated that they claim, so I'm found asking what is really the point of having express shipping options. When you're still not even going to bother actually shipping the posts by express mail. Sorely dissapointed with this company time and time and time again for well beyond my reasoning skills. There's no action anyone can take to actually speed up the process to have their items recieved any faster. As in, pinning where the item is, returning it to the closest post, notifying recipiant that the package has been recieved and ready for pick up. Would be so much faster and reliable for the people actually trying to recieve these posts on time instead of being forced into a corner and made to wait like a good dog."
"TERRIBLE!! Very Poor service.....
Lost my post while delivering, showing delivered while checking the tracking status. Kept complaining for 10 days in a row, and i get a phone call with the same response as on the 1st day as‚ÄúSir, a key was provided in your mailbox, have you checked it?‚Äù
OH WOW...... REALLY??????
Finally gave up and applied for the new passport.
They don‚Äôt guarantee anything. They don‚Äôt understand what they are doing. No RESPONSIBILITIES at allllllllllll."
"Canada Post tracking online is useless.. half the time it will say the expected arrival date but I will never actually see it arrived online.. I will call and ask for help but they will check through the web like myself. I will complete a claim no response. No one knows who does what. The most incompetent employees in a company. Canada post delivery men do not scan parcels half the time when delivered so that the info will be saved.They just drop off.. sometimes I have no choice except to deliver through CPC since some companies deliver their items through CPC. Now I sent a registered letter to Calgary.. same thing , expected arrival date is posted and does not change .. now i have to worry for weeks ..I hope I wont miss the deadline .."
"Horrible....first of all they have lost my luggage and the way they were behaving as if i have lost their luggage....secondly, since I didn't had insurance, they won't pay any thing for my loss..........why do I have to do insurance when I already paid the fee for delivering my luggage ??"
"As a small business owner that ships often, I need to vent and say Canada Post = complete idiocracy. They are making it nearly impossible for me to do business in an efficient manner on a day to day basis. Not to mention day to day problems, each time I need require help, there is an issue with either their website being ""down"" or ""errors"", or if I speak to someone there is miscommunication problem. That is no joke...EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. It's comical at this point. And the rates continue to go UP each year....efficiency and competence go DOWN. It's unbelievable. Please, if you are an online seller shipping to the US, or even just a frequent ONLINE SHOPPER, look into using an alternative service like, Chit Chat Express, Books to the Border, DYK Post etc etc....Don't give CP another cent of your hard earned money, they certainly don't seem to care to want to improve."
"Extremely disappointed. Their service is literally snail speed, no matter if you send a Priority mail or Registered mail, it's horribly slow and unreliable. :C"
"Horrible. Ordereed my package ages ago and it didn't come I called and I spoke to someone and STILL nothing, claiming that my phone is not working, I just had a baby girl and I'm home all day and my phone didn't ring ONCE. I ordered items from other companies and there was no promblem and now I have to go through this wild goose chase to try and receive my package. Very unhappy. I do not trust Canada post."
"I ordered from a Canadian vendor on etsy. Very sweet person. Unfortunately, the items have to ship by CanadaPost. Electronic shipping label created, item picked up, and sits in Ontario from December 29 until 18 January. Not moving. I thought the USPS was bad, but the parcel reached me in four days once it left Ottawa. Now I am waiting on a second parcel from the same vendor-7 days and counting of shipping info received...

Updating to state that it has now been two and a half weeks since the packet shipped, and it has not left Ottawa.

Yet another update It has now been 24 days, which is four days longer than it took to make the item form scratch, and it is STILL sitting as ""Shipping info received"". I have had items shipped from overseas via parcel post that have arrived in less time than this packet has spent in Ottawa.
29 business days, or almost 6 weeks, and I finally have movement. It was ""rerouted"" by accident. It has finally returned to Ottawa, and now is in Ville St Laurent. Almost across the border!!"
"Their process for handling inbound international tracked mail is seriously defective, with a glaring gap that makes items appear to be lost. I sent a packet from England to Canada. Four weeks later the CanadaPost tracking system was still saying ""The item has not arrived in Canada or the sender has not yet shipped it"".

I sent them an e-mail, and they repeated that the item ""is not yet in Canada"" but then said ""It may be with Customs"" - who are obviously in Canada!

I then sent an e-mail to the Customs team, who gave a helpful reply explaining that when tracked mail is received by CPC, they pass it to the Customs team WITHOUT FIRST SCANNING IT. Only after the Customs examination is complete and they hand the item back to CPC is the item then given its first scan to update the tracking page.

My item was eventually delayed by 5 weeks in the Customs area, and due to the CPS defective system, during that whole time the tracking page was still misleadingly saying ""not arrived in Canada or the sender has not ship it yet"". So after 4 weeks my buyer made a PayPal claim for ""Item not received"" and got a refund of his full payment. A week later, the packet cleared Customs and CPC delivered it - with no compensation available to me for my loss.

PayPal judge these claims based only on the mail tracking data, which for Canada Post destinations is seriously flawed and actively misleading. If PayPal can't see tracking data showing delivery, they settle the claim for the buyer, and the sender loses his item AND the purchase price AND the international postage fee.

This glaring hole in the CanadaPost system could easily be fixed by adding a first scan as soon as they receive a tracked item, BEFORE they hand it over to Customs. That very simple change would avoid all these problems and allow senders and addressees to see where their item is. That is exactly how USPS operate, and CPC should urgently change their system to match."
"I just recieved notification that my community mailbox is being replaced. The current community mailbox is in pristine condition. It looks like it was put up yesterday. What kind of stupidity does it take to replace something that is good for decades of further use? Multiply this by however many others are being replaced and the costs become significant. Mismanagement, out of control spending, irresponsibility, wasting taxpayer money, I could go on and on. Canada Post, you truly suck."
"Ridiculous. Drivers enter apartment buildings with filled out ‚Äúmissed delivery‚Äù cards and don‚Äôt even try.
(Twice we caught them and called them out on it; they didn‚Äôt carry anything but a batch of missed delivery notifications)

My husband works from home and since we recently moved in and had a warranty issue with our coffee machine; we received a high number if packages and every single time we would get the card WITHOUT a single attempt!!!!

When complaining, I first spent 45min on the hotline - first speaking with an agent who insisted on taking all information and then his supervisor, who had to retake every single piece of information because he took every thing incorrectly.

... this went on and on and on and last thing they said ‚ÄúWell, I hope this won‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù

Bullsh*t company top down.
No need for actual customer service because of its ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù."
"Second time in less than a week that I am not getting my parcels, when I call I get transfer here and there. Horrible service by phone and in person. And the app is just pointless. They suck! Living in a Small town, and only having them around it even worst!!!"
"Horrible company. Charge $9.95 for brokerage. I called about this charge on a few packages ordered online. The left hand didn‚Äôt know what the right hand was doing. They said it was customs chrge. I called customs they told me it is a Canada Post charge. Basically went back and forth 3 times between the two until I had to argue with the Canada Post rep. She was so rude and was trying to say it‚Äôs not my fault. I said you work for Canada Post, you are Canada Post it‚Äôs Canada Post fault. She was also laughing at me on the phone and was extremely rude mentioning at the end that she wanted good ratings for her customer service survey. Horrible experience and this isn‚Äôt the first time. Brokerage is such a money grab and shouldn‚Äôt be anything over 5$. If you have several packages you should only be billed for I once not on every package. Turned me off completely from ordering anything from the states. Will open my own box in the us and avoid paying Canada Post anymore brokerage. PS Canada Post TRain ur employees they don‚Äôt know how to
Do their jobs."
"I've had plenty of issues with Canada post over the years. I once bought a video game on floppy disk and it was sent in a package that had ""do not fold"" written on it. What did these Canada post workers do? Why they folded it of course. Other times I've had deliveries that never showed up. Recently I bought some software DVD's from OSDISC.COM and they were never delivered to me. The package had a tracking number so I called Canada Post customer service and told them the tracking number. And they told me the item was successfully delivered on January 16th, 2018. Even though the DVD's were nowhere to be found. Its sad that Canada Post has become such an incompetent and inept company. The people of Canada deserve better than this trash."
"Paid $50.00 to mail a small package to England. Package never arrived and Canada Post takes no responsibility. There is no claim process on small packet air-international. So they will take your money but will not even guarantee their service.
What a joke. Oh and customer service non-existent. You can file a complaint that is meaningless as they admitted they won't even follow up on the complaint. Only in government..."
"For 2017 Canada Post lost 2 packages for me. I had ordered these items from overseas and they haven't shown up after 8 months and the other hasn't shown up after 5 months. It would have been 3 packages but one of the packages had been delivered to someone else in my neighbourhood and they were good enough to drop if off. Also received 3 smashed packages from them with one of the packages in a plastic bag saying ""we found it this way"" Somehow the contents in any of the cases above were not damaged but really why should I have to worry about whether or not my package will survive. I've only lost 1 package before while using Canada Post, now all of a sudden in 2017 nearly 3 packages are lost and packages are smashed... I'm worried that other things aren't going to show up now. Terrible service."
"Paid for next day delivery, still waiting. Very unhappy with the service. Use anybody but Canada Post."
"Smashed my wine and beer delivery, delayed it for two weeks all the while getting me to call back every few days to check the status of the delivery and find out information only to waste my time."
"Every time I order a package from amazon, or anywhere now really, they leave delivery notices because are too lazy to deliver it to my door. I am Usually home when they write the delivery notices which makes 0 sense. Just terrible. I have called in the past, multiple times to complain, but nobody does anything about it."
"Today I was expecting my new phone to arrive. Have been watching the tracking for days. I stayed home ALL day anticipating it‚Äôs arrival. Didn‚Äôt go do my errands or grocery shopping as planned. STAYED HOME WAITING. then, checked the tracking once more to see that the driver has ‚Äúleft a notice‚Äù. NO you didn‚Äôt. I was home all day. There was no knock at my door and NO notice was left. I have cameras to prove it. PURE LAZINESS. I am not sure what requirements it takes to get hired but, you pay people to NOT do their one job. Now I don‚Äôt know where my phone was taken or when to pick it up. I‚Äôm going to visit my brand new niece and wanted my new phone to take pictures. Why do you even have the option to track your parcel to ensure you will be home when YOU DONT EVEN ATTEMPT DELIVERY??? Pathetic!!! Too bad I have to even give you one star."
"If you don't mind to lost 1 on 5 parcel get lost send with poste canada.
I am not kidding.

Worst service ever.

My dad use to work there 50 year ago as a poste men!
Thing change, Canada Poste to!"
Worst place I've ever had to deal with. They lost my package and refuse to admit or contact me about it. I keep calling and they keep getting NO where. It's been over a week and this is getting ridiculous. They were supposed to call me back but have yet to do that. Have spent over an hour on hold to get told nothing every day. Can't even get my refund until they admit they lost it and contact my sending company. All I can say is DO NOT USE CANADA POST.
"Terrible garbage service
I sent confidential document to Guelph from Mississauga
It went to Halifax and it got lost

I encourage everybody to send their stories to consumers alert to CTV
As I did"
"Edited/updated
Overall, the service is fine. Very few issues, and shipping speed have improved a lot since 2018."
"Canada Post extremely untrustworthy. God knows how many times I have been scammed by paying for ""express"" services but only to learn that my packages were delivered according to the regular timeline. Too bad we are stock with Canada Post and have no other option."
"Terrible service, LAZY personnel! Received a notice of delivery in my mailbox for a parcel I was expecting from France. A parcel that would have fit in my mailbox with no problem. Instead I am told I have to pick it up myself! I tracked this parcel from the time it left France. Took exactly 20 days as it said, delivery notice was written the next day and I found it in my mailbox a day later. No attempt at all to deliver! And was told it would be impossible to redeliver it to my mailbox. Entered a complaint with Canada's post but little good that will do me, they will not deliver it to my box either! Just a complaint number entered...big deal!"
"Allright, i've had a plethora of issues with canada post, too many to list (from not getting packages, no delivery, or failure to track items)
But i'm just going to list the most recent....i have a package coming from the states, parcel came into missauga, was listed as in transit, missed my city entirely and was 400km north, before the sent it back, not to my city, but 200km east. On the 11th Before it disappeared entirely today 15th from the system. Tracking the package now tells me i have entered a valid tracking number but its not in the system.

I've started complaing to all my shippers (instead of canada post) to refrain from using services that will travel through canada post, Amazon specfically has said they will use Ups for future service's

I don't know what the deal is, few years ago Canada post was Decent as i've been getting regularly shipped items since 2011, since 2014 its seen a rapid decline in service, i tell any sellers i do business with to avoid canada post as it has a 30% FAILURE rate of even recieving packages"
"Two weeks for a letter to reach an address in the same town. Mailed December 22, received January 9. Canada post needs a massive reform, and needs to stop making their employees do 10 jobs."
All of the below & then some.. contacting them does little to nothing you can join them online to watch your package go back and forth from CP location to location not going to the customer who is waiting for 'out on delivery' and it is out on delivery to another station and nobody knows why. If they are going to play online with the pros like Amazon they are crazy. Amazon worked out a deal to get me exactly my package within the time they promised and I will get it before Canada Post has finished their Investigation only to conclude a week later They have found the order on that is maybe in Richmond; maybe on the way to the depot. As a Voting Canadian I think Amazon themselves should be allowed to compete with Canada Post to deliver with their own services to cities like Vancouver.
"Horrible customer service. Raised my concern about an expedited package not delivered on time and I was told I could pick it up after hours. Turns out the Canada post depot I was to pickup 'after hours' closes BEFORE the drivers stop delivering. I have to wait until Monday for a critical package.

Terrible company, misled by staff and supervisors lie!"
Horrible service lately. Our packages are continuously being dropped off at the wrong house. Last week a notice was left in my mailbox to go pick up my parcel at the local post office the next day. - I went to pick it up and they had no record of the parcel. I spent 40 minutes on the phone with Canada post who said it was sent to a different post office by mistake and they would have it to me within the next couple of days. I still have not received the parcel. Very poor service lately in the emerald park (S4L1C5) Saskatchewan area.
Pay a lot for priority 1 - 2 business days. Package arrives 5 whole business days late. This is a regular occurrence shipping between the most populated areas of Canada. This company is absolute trash garbage. That's crown company workers and management for ya.
"AVOID CANADA POST

Spend a few more dollars and make sure you actually RECEIVE your parcel. I got a notification saying that the parcel was being sent to the sender due to incomplete address on Jan 4 at 17.25. I contacted them on Jan 6 to ask about this and they got my address again and said they would correct it and I would get the parcel within a week. I didn't get the parcel within a week and contacted them again and they said it was being sent to Ukraine. They said I should've called within two business days. I checked the tracking number and realized I HAD called them within two business days, so I contacted them again and they said they don't correct the address! Each of them told me something different. The box contained my Christmas presents and Canada Post RUINED my Christmas! Never going to use it again!"
"Canada Post said they do not need to check if people are home when delivering anymore ... Agent then said ( after i had to wait 25 minutes for one to pickup ) after 15 minutes "" I have gone over my time have a good day "" when i asking general questions about how shipping works"
"Canada Post dropped the ball again!!..Its time for the decision makers to step aside & let a reliable shipper take over...It is sad to see an old reliable institution like Canada post go out with such shame!...Like any team, when losing, there comes a point in time when its time to fire the manager, hire a new coach & start over with pride & integrity...I say this with sadness as In my opinion Canada post has become ""Canada Past""....My reasons for writing this are much the same as most of the other reviews so I will not go on any further........I will say that I am very frustrated with the service ( that I paid good money for)!!!!.........."
"Called the general customer service number to stop a return to sender package that JUST got identified as such. Lady was very lazy and said it couldnt be stopped. She didn't even make a damn phone call to try. Needless to say, I didn't take no for an answer and resolved the issue on my own. Canada post has brutal customer service and I will not use them to be the provider for my business.

The only positive is: Thank God there was Joanna from Mayfield Canada Post who took it upon herself to track it down in the back for me. Bottom line is national customer service is extremely pathetic, local customer service in Edmonton is fantastic."
"Waited for a package for the last 3 days that said it was being delivered. Checked today and it said they delivered it and left a card for pick-up...well that is a lie. They never delivered it! No card left on the door or in the mailbox regarding pick-up, no footprints in the snow and nothing on the security camera. Lazy frigging CP employees who scam not only their employer but it's customers as well. Called Canada Post and they said they would provide me with the information regarding where I can pick it up. No I won't pick it up because it is too heavy for me to lift that is why I paid for door to door delivery thank you. Then told by the customer service rep that it could take up to another 5 days for redelivery. Where did the redelivery fit into the equation? If you never delivered it in the first place it is called delivery. I ask to speak to supervisor to make a complaint and tell them I demand my item delivered today. Spoke to a supervisor and she said she would ensure it was delivered today. So here I wait out another day for Canada Post to deliver my parcel. Well I can honestly say that I will never again use your parcel delivery service."
Terrible service! Their carriers do not drop packages off. They leave a notice for you to pick up. Very lazy people. 2 days in a row I have been home and waiting only to find that there is pick up slip in my mail box. Avoid shipping with canada post at all costs.What annoys me most is paid extra for shipping.. Completely terrible service!
"I am so frustrated with Canada Post. Back in December they lost a package that came from overseas. The shipping label clearly said the proper address, which was in Ontario. When I checked the tracking number it showed being in Mississauga and to be delivered the following day. 2 days passed no delivery, so I checked again. It now said that it went to Barnaby BC and delivery was complete...HUH? I called CP and they told me they couldn't help me, I needed to get in touch with the original shipping company...once again HUH? CP was the last ones to have their hands on my package, they were the ones that delivered it to the wrong address and not just down the street or the next city over, clear across the country but they hold no responsibility!!!"
"They are trying to compete with real package delivery companies and I pay 15 dollars for expresspost and never get 2 day delivery, never get a refund because they always have an excuse, like UPS or Purolator are never late AND they do Saturday, Canada post is a joke and there employees are either dumb AF or don‚Äôt care most of the time and don‚Äôt even knock, just leave a note saying they knocked even though u we‚Äôre home ALL DAY, like if you want to beat the competition you need to do better, like delivery on weekends on holidays or hire more people to handle the volume of deliveries considering they can barely handle normal volumes of packages, I just want something I payed EXTRA for ON TIME, and if you didn‚Äôt get expresspost, You can wait cause yours didn‚Äôt cost 20% extra for gaurenteed delivery"
"I sent off payments to banks in the US with Xpresspost a week ago. Paid $26/envelope. Supposed to be at destination in 1-3 business days. The banks still have not received after a week and the tracking numbers do not work other than telling me that my envelopes arrived in a foreign country on 1/3/18. Next time I am using Fedex, no matter how much it costs."
"I am extremely frustrated with Canada Post. My driver never buzzes me and just leaves slips when I am home to receive them. I have opened numerous tickets with them with no results. today at around 1230PM I Received an email regarding the attempted delivery of my package with Canada Post. I was home. They didn't buzz. They Didn't knock. This has been happening forever. I called and was on hold for 30 minutes only to be greeted by rudest customer service rep . Her tone was condescending and harsh, she said that numbers are missing from both my tracking numbers and made many errors in judgement on how to speak to a customer. when she was proving to be unhelpful I asked to speak with someone else and she refused. she also hung up on me. So I call back. Wait on hold ANOTHER 30 minutes only to have my call answered and immediately disconnected. There is nowhere online that I can find to email my complaint. Their customer service reps are ignorant, unhelpful and rude, and the drivers are too lazy to do their jobs and deliver the package to the recipient."
"$42 for next day delivery that still is not delivered 4 days later, if this was not a government company they would be shutdown, so guess what happens to our tax dollars!"
"Canada post is the garbage post please don‚Äôt ever trust this garbage post

Don‚Äôt use this shity post
Thank you"
"Exceptionally disappointed with Canada post..

Save door to door they say. How about, deliver my stuff on time.
An express post package dropped at the post office before 9 am Tuesday in Richmond BC is going to be 6 days by the time it gets to me in Brandon. Could have drove there and picked it up and been back home. I should have had this parcel in my hand after 2 days, the tracking only showed one scan for arrival in Richmond and nothing else. Just a joke.

Private courier is the way to go folks. Don't let CanyP the drunk courier handle your stuff."
"Payed 8 dollars extra for amazon prime shipping, product had a scanning issue and was delayed by 4 damn days. Fix your damn machines you idiots.."
"Never again!

After requesting for the recipient of a package to have to sign for it, it gets delivered (two days late), is left outside, in the freezing Canadian weather, with no care for the fact that the extreme weather will damage the contents of the package. No signature, no care in the world, package was left outside in a busy neighborhood!

The only plus was that the people at the call centre were very nice and polite. But there was nothing they could do for the error and carelessness of the delivery person."
This had to be the single worst company on the planet. I sit here 2 days after the scheduled delivery still waiting. I remember why I swore off these guys. I regret wanting to save 5 bucks with free shipping. Lesson learned.
"I'm giving 1 star via force. Although, most of the time I do end up getting my packages so I guess that alone is worth the 1 star.

I think of the last 10 packages I have received from Canada Post, 1 of them have been on time. Lately they haven't been scanning into the system and Canada Post is blaming the shipping party - yet I've confirmed with the shipping party they were sent. The supervisory team assures me they haven't received the package yet - but yet, it can appear in there systems a few hours later (days behind) but already in my city! How's that for magic?

Bottom line, this company cannot uphold the commitments and expectations in which it sets when you are selecting your delivery options. Your package will not be delivered on time and do not expect any sort of help from the staff.

This is what happens when something is Government run and unionized. There's zero accountability. Don't use them if you can avoid it. They won't care either way."
"If it was possible I would give it 0.0001, I have been waiting 9 days for an expensive ""Express post""... Had so much fun as I watched the tracking tool... My package sat in the same place for 7 business days. The package I ordered before that got lost, the one before that 4 days late on Express post. The one before that 3 days late on Express post
Why are we paying outrageous prices for a service that DOES NOT DO AS IT SAYS? Be honest with customers, tell them the truth and don't charge extra for a service that does not work. Worst customer service, there is no way to contact anyone or do anything about it...."
"Package gets processed in my city with an expected arrival that same day now its 3 days later nothing on the tracking has been updated and i cant even talk to a real person theyre 'help line"" is fully automated and just tells me what i see on my current tracker"
I live in Australia and received 2 cards yesterday (one Christmas one Anniversary ) both posted in November.They were in a terrible condition..ragged with torn edges and obvious signs of water damage (photos have been recorded).My 2 cards sent with Australia Post..at the same time..arrived in Canada in good condition and on time (about 2/3 weeks travel time).Very disappointed with Canada Post..very proud of Australia Post..onya Aussies !
"my parcel is stuck in some canada post, in qc lasalle for 7 days now im from calgary and it hasnt move yet. I paid an over priced shipping rate, from the buyer and i got this A W E S O M E service. seriously canadian companies should use other delivery company other than this trash."
"Canada Post sucks !!!

My packaged are constantly delivered to different mail boxes in my building. Some neighbors are hones enough to give them back to me but others prefer to keep them. So, i am supplying my neighbors with goods on a regular basis. I called Canada Post several times and made complains about the poor service they offer but nothing have changed. I am really mad about the last package I didn't get. Somebody got nice boots as a Christmas gift.
Canada post is absolutely useless and needs to stop operating!!!!"
"Horrible service, incompetent people delivering the packages. Ive had a package missing for 3 weeks, tracking tells me it is bouncing back and forth between distribution centres perpetually. Good lord. And good luck finding a phone number, or a real person to speak to."
"My business has been posting items to Canada from the UK every week for the last couple of years. Most of them arrive in Canada within 2-3 days. They then sit in a Canada Post depot for between 5 and 30 days before slowly making their way across the country over the next 5-30 days. About 10% are lost on the way.

I post items worldwide and Canada Post are one of the most incompetent delivery services we've used. We've literally sent items into warzones that have arrived more quickly!

Canadians deserve much better."
"Was waiting for packages all day and got notified by Google Delivery Notifications stating that they somehow ""attempted delivery"" with all five packages.

Yet I have 3 dogs and and not once did they act up which they always do when someone even comes into our driveway. Yet they must have flying delivery trucks because there's not even tire tracks on the fresh snow of our driveway from last night.

Every single delivery slip was just jammed into our mailbox.

This has happened every single time we're forced to use Canada Post we've yet to receive a single successful delivery(10+ failed attempts this year alone with zero signs of actual ""attempting"" like its claimed)."
"Why is everyone so surprised?
a government run, union protected bunch of lazy over paid morons who couldn't get a real job if there life depended on it. They operate with total impunity and absolutely no accountability. Show them video evidence that would get anyone else instantly fired and they just shrug (literally supervisor said ""yeah so?"")
Fear not, they will retire one day and your taxes will reward them with an obscene pension and benefits that you mere mortals could only dream about."
This 1 star review doesn't make Canada post any better.
"I have mobility issues so I do most of my shopping online. I ordered a shelf from Amazon, paid for delivery and have been waiting for it to be delivered for 2 days (paid for 2 day shipping).

After not receiving anything, I called Canada Post with the tracking number to be told that the note in their computer says ""package too heavy - left at local postal station for pickup by customer"".

Really????? Its not my problem if the driver (I live in a large city and they deliver packages via truck) can't handle or can't be bothered to handle the item because it is heavy.. By the way, whether they bring the package to my door or to the local postal outlet - both require basically the same amount of strength and energy for the driver, so why didn't the driver ring my bell????

My guess, they couldn't be bothered as it is very cold right now and so much more comfortable in their trucks. Canada Post is in a weird place with employees who are ""old timers"" and are only there to put in their time until they can get to that nice cushy pension OR they are staffed with newcomers who have been told clearly that the ""glory days"" of working at CP are over - meaning lower wages and benefits and much less job security - meaning most employees are there for the cash and nothing more. We, the customers, are stuck with this pathetic situation,

I have asked to speak with a Supervisor (by phone) at CP. Apparently, they should be calling me back in 4 hours. I doubt they will, but we will see. If I don't hear back by tomorrow morning, I am contacting my ombudsman.

If I produced this type of substandard work to our customers, my company would fire me."
"Four deliveries in the last month status always said attempted delivery notice left and that was not the case at all. I was home during every 'delivert attempt' and not one notice was every left. No way to actually complain regarding specific deliveries. I live in a rural area and fully believe they don't want to take the time to actually try a delivery it's just easier for them to go straight to the post office, but do they even think about the inconvenience for us to get to the post office in a rural area!!!!!! It's about time we are able to hold someone accountable for our inconvenience."
"Canada post consistently over-delivers on their promises. They ship packages fast and on-time, sometimes even earlier than their expected shipping date. Great service, no complaints."
"My mom sent a package with Christmas gifts via Canada Post from Dawson creek B.C. to Vancouver Island, also in B.C., she sent it on the 16th and paid 50$ extra with a date of delivery set for the 21st. It is now the 27th and I just got back from the post office to retrieve my package, got turned around, was told I can‚Äôt pick it up until tomorrow afternoon now. For starters she could have sent it for 15$ reg mail instead of over 80$ for express, it wasn‚Äôt going to be here for Xmas anyway. They lied to her face saying it will be here by a certain date, then ripped her off by charging her extra. Neither her or myself will ever use Canada Post again as this is not the first time something like this has happened You guys run a horrible company, full of liars and rip off artists I will be moving forward looking for the money back you took from my mom, and makes me wonder how many other Canadians got ripped off this holiday season?? Canada Post sucks! Merry Xmas a**holes."
"So upsetting, sent my mother and my good girlfriends Christmas cards all sent to their bussiness not homes and zero were delivered!

I will never use Canada post again.
Obviously one of your workers stole the cards to see what was inside!

Your company should be ashamed of itself!"
"REALLY CANADA POST????
I sent a letter registered mail from Thunder Bay to Toronto - so it won't get lost (or hopefully not) on December 23rd and it says the expected delivery date is January 2nd?
I could probably walk with the letter to Toronto and get it there faster."
"I bought a gamma spect in November 2017, still not arrived with no apology for the delay, that is the last time I buy from Canada, total rubbish with no care for the customer, I did pay ¬£45.00 for postage to UK from Canada thinking it a fair honest cost but then I was informed the device will take 6 to 8 weeks !! Post from china takes 1 week, what is wrong with Canada post, I am now in doubt if I shall ever see the device I paid ¬£400 for the above, how does dishonesty get the best ? someone has a load of stuff STOLEN by Canada post operatives, I have NO comeback for my sale."
"Do not use , I ship a lot out of the country. A lot of thieves insiders , they connect with States ,stealing valuable packages .Super hard to get back insurance."
"Terrible terrible customer service and unreliable delivery service. When I call customer service regarding my international expressed parcel with tracking number with the online status saying out for delivery but never came, I spoke to 5 different agent all 5 of them gave different information about my situation from telling me it‚Äôs guaranteed delivered today to I think you might need an investigation because no scan on this parcel usually means it‚Äôs gone missing. Submitted a service ticket which they promise a red flag to my package and have it out to me ASAP never happened too. Not even a single email were sent to me regarding my situation, all they say is got to talk to sender to have his end do investigation. My parcel is in Canada post hands and they have no clue or trace of my delivery, absolutely ridiculous and not acceptable as we all citizens living in Canada rely on them for trust and service really need to make improvements and get new motivated employees on."
I wish i could give a zero star as they dont even deserve the one that i was forced to five. Worst shipping company I have ever dealt with. I will NEVER order anything online ever that deals with them shipping my item. The cost is ridiculous for shipping I paid more to ship it with them than the item was even worth.
"Canada Post embarrasses themselves yet again. The level of incompetence and stupidity of their staff is infuriating. I xpressposted a package from Calgary to Edmonton that was scheduled to be delivered on Wednesday, Dec 20 and it's now 5pm on Friday, Dec 22. It's been sitting in some warehouse in Edmonton for the past 3 days, and there hasn't been a single delivery attempt made. Even though Christmas is on Monday, it's just going to keep sitting there until after the holidays. I wonder how many other people Canada Post has put in the same position as me? It will be no surprise when they announce that they're closing their doors. They've got all the symptoms of a failing business. I will never use their services again."
"This company is a good example of the drawbacks of job security. People become entitled and complacent when there is little to no accountability.
Obviously it would not be fair to paint every one of their employees with the same brush (as I‚Äôm sure there are pleasant and hard-working individuals amongst their staff), but the ones I‚Äôve dealt with had been unprofessional to say the least. Lazy, confrontational, judgmental, and most importantly...dishonest. Qualities that are detrimental in any profession, especially one that deals with customer confidentiality.
I just called the bluff on a delivery person who told me that it‚Äôs Canada Post‚Äôs policy where they do not have to make an attempt to locate/contact the recipient if the persons name isn‚Äôt on the intercom system (I live in a condo that has both a buzzer system and 24 hr concierge). Never bothered to check with the concierge or make an attempt to contact me before slipping a delivery/pick-up notice in my mailbox. Luckily I checked my delivery status and caught him before he left the building.
I‚Äôm one of the original owners whose name had been on file since the beginning. Many residents, like myself, do not have a buzzer set up due to various reasons, but our names are accurately reflected in the system accessible by concierge.
When I asked the Canada Post employee to check with the concierge (who was present the entire time) to ascertain my ID on the system, he outright refused and lied to me regarding their policy (I called Canada Post customer service afterwards and confirmed my suspicion).
Long story short, I managed to get the parcel out of this guy‚Äôs clutches but at what cost? An unnecessary dispute that could have been easily avoided by the slightest display of responsibility and customer service.
Job security is great, but when it is offered indiscriminately without any form of accountability, it often becomes the ultimate downfall of an organization. Canada Post is, sadly, an example of that."
"Unreliable, lazy and poor attitude. It's their union mentality. When we use Fedex or Purolator or UPS the difference is staggering. I pray for the day that Canada Post closes down and all the workers can get what they deserve - unemployment! It's an embarrassment, almost criminal."
They never attempt to deliver packages anymore. Complete incompetence and baffling how lazy these overpaid government workers are. I am getting so sick of having to go to the post office for EVERY package. IT IS YOUR JOB TO TRY TO DELIVER. Don't lie and say you attempted. I WORK FROM HOME AND KNOW IF YOU TRIED.
"Worst canadian company.
First canadian disappointment since Im there.
Was waiting my book the whole damn day but the delivery guy felt the urge to push the book (which is quite big) through the mail slot instead of ringing the door. Just genius.
So I ve just bought a brand new item but received it damaged thanks to Canada Post.

Nice guys, we are soon in 2018 but you are proving us that not everything improves with time. You should close your company and start from scratch, seriously.

Note : Ive read other reviews about this company, most of the users only posted 1 review on trustpilot which means that your services are so bad that we create a trustpilot account just to tell you how much you suck. Incredible."
"This is a review for Canada Post operating out Pharmasave 154. It is disgusting.. The teller picked her nose, and tranferred it to my package, while I was standing there. I thought I was going to get Ecoli or something, who raises these people?

JUST DISGUSTING !!!"
"Waiting for a shipment from the USA into Edmonton. Tracking from Canada Post states it is in my community mail box. Yeah right, it is not. Canada Post will not start a review of the loss unless the shipper asks for that. Thanks Canada post for not doing your job and delivering my mail to my community mail box. Keep up the good work."
"I have ordered 3 different packages online all arriving at different times. You would think at least 1 would make it to me. I'm seasonal worker so during this time I am home. Not once did they bring any of my packages to me. The first time they just threw the slip in the mail box, not a knock or ring of the door bell. The following time I didn't even receive a slip. I had to call my local post office to ask them if they had arrived. They told me that they have been sitting there for a couple days and that if I had not gone to get them within 15 days they would have been sent back. The last time I made it a goal to get them. I knew the package was coming that day so I sat and waited. I saw the vehicle pull up and she got out without a package in her hand. I heard her doing something at my front door then saw her walk away. I opened the door to see the slip hanging there. Instantly I called her back and said were you not going to deliver my package to me. She stated she had knocked twice. I told her I was sitting there watching her the whole time. All she could do was apologize and that she would not do it again. Pathetic This company has hired some of the laziest ppl I have ever seen."
"This company just keeps getting worse. I made 3 orders, two from the US on Nov 29th & Dec 1st, and one from Canada on Dec 7th. Here it is Dec 18th, and I still sit and wait for all 3. Almost 3 whole weeks for the first 2 order made on the 29th & 1st. I can see maybe customs (can't really see a hold up for clothes) or the US company that it was shipped out on to get to the border, but the 3rd package that was shipped from Windsor to take more than 5 days is completely rediculous. It was shipped out on the 8th and here I sit 10 days later and it hasn't even arrived in Richmond for processing to be shipped over to Vancouver Island. I don't care what time of year it is, it should never take more than 5 business days to go from Ontario to BC.
I completely give up on customer service cause all they tell you is exactly what I see on the website. Why are you paying people to read the same website that we read? Pay me then since I'm doing the same job as they are doing, looking at the website. Then they say to call the company I purchased from so they can contact Canada Post and open a ticket. Are you f'ing kidding me? It's not their fault the package hasn't arrived yet, it's Canada Posts fault. Maybe if you guys did some actual work and investigated a bit you can give an honest answer, but apparently that's asking too much. These are mainly gifts for Christmas, that's why they were ordered with ample amount of time to arrive. Apparently I should've ordered them at the middle of November due to Canada Posts lack of efficient service.
Oh, and I'm still waiting on a package that you guys lost that was supposed to be delivered in May. An 11lb package that just vanished.

Edit: LOL, and it finally showed up in Richmond and they put on the tracking, ""Delivery may be delayed due to extreme weather conditions"". There is no extreme weather conditions. Such a fraud of a company."
"I sent a parcel which I pay a 3 days expresspost.aside from delayed, took 7 days,12/5@9:13am fort mc Murray.12/5@12:05 noon,address possible delay.12/7@9:55am return to sender.
First of all, I often send a box to the said address of the building and it just happen now that address possible delay?
2nd:Why they didn't left to the post office near the address for few days before they return.
3rd= the receiver call the post office in mc Murray 12/6 and they say it's on process.
4rth= I pay again the return pay which the same with the amount when I sent.
This is not a joke.please do your job."
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? I've ordered two packages a month ago just to be sure I get them before Christmas AND I STILL HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THEM! God hurry the hell up Canada Post! my packages are in Montreal for ""further processing"" and the updates don't inform me anymore of movements. I hate this company so much. Are you guys seriously working hard to deliver packages or just sitting in your trucks somewhere? Get your acts together and actually start working. They have the worst reviews I have ever seen for a delivery company. Simply horrible."
"absolutely the worse mis managed company I can mention. you would think they would have a bit more consideration for parcels especially during the Christmas season. I've ordered 6 gifts, so far 4 have been ""delivered"", only received 2. one of the 2 I got only cause a ticket was left to pick up at the local post office, the second a friend of mine found it in our ""return to sender box"" outside our mailroom. now I got buzzed to come down and pick another one up. took me maybe 5mins max to go downstairs, now the mail lady has no idea where it is?!?!, she actually lost it in those 5mins! yesterday I get a msg saying another gift had been delivered, and what a shock, I don't have it, not even a slip to go pick it up. I questioned the mail lady today, and says ""I don't have a parcel for you"". what the heck is wrong with you ppl. honestly, what if these were the only gifts I could get my kids! so now i'm sol?! did these mail personnel keep the gifts for themselves? i really can't believe the unprofessionalism and disrespect for other ppls mail/parcels, you guys disgust me to the fullest!!!!"
"Literally 95% of anything I have shipped gets screwed up in so many inventive ways. It's baffling how disorganised, incompetent and genuinely unconcerned this company is with their core services; customer relations and delivery of items. At this point, having used their so called ""service"" hundreds of times due to having no other option in most cases, I'm just totally gobsmacked and have basically begun to not only expect an issue every time but have had to just laugh about it in order to not utterly lose it while dealing with this company."
"Carelessly dropped my car keys in the room at a motel in Lillooet B.C. as I was leaving. Drove 12 hours to my home in Alberta before realizing they were not with me. Contacted the motel and got confirmation the keys were found. After searching online it became clear the only option for me to get the keys sent to Edmonton was Canada Post. Michelle in Lillooet was awesome. Polite, helpful and very knowledgeable of the system / process she went above and beyond despite having a horrendous head cold during the hectic holiday mailing season. Michelle described the options and the merits of service selection with respect to my circumstances. I asked many questions to establish where my package would be delivered. I was assured the package would be delivered to my home so I made sure I would be physically present in my driveway when the package was out for delivery. Then despite the statements assuring customers that CP actually prioritizes package delivery to the recipient's physical address; all the denials and unclear information regarding actual delivery locations, CP did the worst thing it could do in my situation. The delivery date slipped a day which isn't unexpected given the time of year but I was diligent in tracking the package and made sure I was in the driveway the moment the item status switched to 'out for delivery'. Then it happened: Within 20 mins. the delivered notification. The package had been delivered to the community mailbox. Why, if this is what Canada Post routinely does is it not published openly on their websites; why are their reps trained to tell clients otherwise, etc.? Why, when you ask a representative or look it up on their website are you told the lie that every effort will be made to deliver to the physical address?
Had Michelle (been trained and not told to tell people the pie in the sky lie regarding where CP deliver packages), had the website; or, better yet, the tracking tools, stated the destination would be the community mailbox then I would have waited there; not in my driveway (well down the street & around a corner from the CM). Why is this such an issue? Because my mailbox key was locked in my car... and, THEY locked my car keys in my mailbox. It cost me an additional $70, and another lost hour, to get my car door opened to retrieve my mailbox key so I could retrieve my car keys."
"Where do I start with this trash company? The 1st incident my item was 2 days late, 2nd incident it was late once again I had to pick up. Now today they are 2 days late I decided to call them and see whats up they simply told me computer chair I ordered was too heavy for the person to carry the chair is 16kg that's not even that bad.."
Canada Post claims to have sent me a notice twice by the mail to go pick it up but I haven't received any of these notices in my mailbox. I was supposed to receive my item in the mail by Friday December 8th 2017 and now they refuse to have it sent to my house. The service I paid for was to have it shipped to my home and I haven't even received the notice claims. I want my money back. This is unnacceptable. I filed a customer complaint to Canada post because they did not abide by their regulations because they did not send me the product I paid for and did not leave me any notice claims. I want my money back.
"They cannot figure out left from right. Every single time a package ends up with Canada Post vs. UPS/Fed Ex it seems to get lost and delayed constantly. Further they just give up on trying to deliver it and send you on a wild goose chase to multiple locations because nobody can figure out where the package went.

My packages are simply to be delivered to a business open from 9 AM - 7 PM. The front desk is constantly staffed and ready to accept deliveries. They somehow cannot figure out how to make the delivery in the given time frame. Will be avoiding at all costs."
"Canada Post has to be the most accessible and reliable service I have used. I have ordered many things online via UPS, Fedex and other 3rd party companies. None compare to Canada Post, they are always on time and have continued to be throughout the Holiday Season, most of my orders arrive one or two days earlier. I order off Amazon Prime every week and my packages arrive within 2 business days.

I use their drop off service near my house which is a great feature if you don't want to risk leaving the package outside your front door. I really have never had a negative experience with them and I have used them dozens of times in the past and will continue to do so.

Thank you Canada Post for you constant great service!"
"I am not happy with my service at my Grosse Isle community mail boxes. I have contacted both Stonewall post office and Grosse Isle post office in search for my parcel from B and C Boutique ( third party company from Amazon). On both amazon and canada post tracking shows that my parcel was delivered to my community mailbox, but have not received it. They seem not to have any interest in looking for it...wondering if maybe the employee either put it in the wrong mailbox or took it home herself. I know that she has previously put a parcel for someone else in my mailbox and I was honest and returned it so the proper person gets his/her parcel that they paid for. This item was not a cheap item..I refuse to accept responsibility for the lose. I will fight to get my money back whether it is contacting bbb or the the press. This has to stop...people pay good money for these items and should not let it just go..."
"They lost the item again! I am in a long distance relationship for two years now and both of the years, I sent my husband a birthday card with a tracking number, 30 days in advance. His birthday is tonight and can somebody explain me as to why his card is sitting in Netherlands since the past 10 days while he lives in UAE???"
"The experience I had today was not very pleasant. The doorbell had been rung and the door knocked on multiple times. I was going to get it, until I saw an unknown man looking through the little window beside my door. At this point, I decided not to get it because I didn't recognize the man. He was there for almost 5 minutes ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door obnoxiously. Not to mention he was looking through my window into my house. If he was wearing traditional post delivery uniform, I probably would have answered the door. But I couldn't even tell he worked for them, as he was wearing a beanie and civilian clothes. (The package wasn't for me), an attempted delivery slip or package was never placed outside, so we don't know if well ever even receive the package."
"I‚Äôve never had Canada Post deliver a parcel when they say they will. They are always late often simply leaving a delivery failure notice forcing you to have to go to a post office to pick up your package. When this happens you often must wait in a long line only to be spoken to flippantly/condescended to by a Canada Post employee who clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be there. My last Amazon Prime order was through them. They marked the item as delivered but it never arrived. Canada Post suggested I contact Amazon myself to launch an investigation. They lose/possibly steal your stuff and take no responsibility for it whatsoever. I have no idea how something is marked as delivered that wasn‚Äôt. I have never had any issues with any other courier except for DHL and Purolator which is an offshoot of Canada Post. Canada Post is without a doubt the worst delivery service in Canada. As Amazon Prime uses Canada Post for deliveries, I have cancelled my Amazon Prime account. There is nothing Prime about Canada Post. I truly hope they are dissolved so we no longer have to pay with our taxes to fund this horrible service full of lazy, inept, entitled workers who can‚Äôt do their job worth a damn."
"They lost my package then began to tell me it's the sender's fault they didn't do anything to help the package is 5 days late then I began to tell them I already contacted sender canada post took it from them but never scanned it nor even cared to find it for me they just kept saying it will be there I would have to say this is the worse service ever avoid at all cost go with purilator or fed x much better shipping from those 2 companys and canada post every time i pay xpress post ""cost me alot"" and my package shows up the next week it's always 3 to 4 days late when it's suppose to make it to me within 3 days never does. canada post is useless."
"Fraudulent organization, which needs to avoided at all costs. The absolve themselves from any and all responsibility at every step of postal process. Their customer service department representatives inform you of fictitious and imaginary departments that are 'investigating' service tickets, a claim that is then falsified by their department manager. Opening service tickets as a receiver only serves to provide you with email updates of what the 'tracking number' indicates - something you can just check on your own without a service ticket. As a receiver you are prohibited from inquiry about a posted package, despite being the owner of the sent package."
"The store retail counters are stuffed to the gills with packages. I get Flex Delivery notices that tell me the package is ready, but when I go to pick them up, they ""haven't been scanned"". There will be piles of boxes sitting everywhere there's room. Secure? Not really. The folks at the counter (usually just one, actually) sometimes get chippy, but who can blame them?"
"Why would my parcel for quebec go stoney creek, kitchener then back to stoney creek. Its bad enough when I dropped it off I asked express post and the dimwit put I expedited parcel and did t want to fix it because of a lineup. 2days versus 9days not a huge difference I cost but now what on earthis this routing waste of time?"
"We never had issues before this year with the Canada Post mail carriers delivering our packages. But this past year has been ridiculous!!...I can be home all day and then check our mailbox in the late afternoon only to discover that there is a Delivery Notice of Attempted Delivery. Really???...I was home ALL day and my phone/intercom did not ring once. They have become so lazy that they don't even try to deliver. The parcel remains in their truck and instead they just drop off a notice for pick up at our local postal outlet the next day after 1 pm. On the very rare occasion that they actually buzz and attempt delivery they no longer bring it uo to our door . They wait in the lobby for us to go down. A few times this past year they even shoved items in our mailbox and ruined them!! I do a lot of online shopping with Amazon.ca and their customer service is a 5*!!!...they call if tbey don't get an answer at home and ask what time I will be home so they can deliver my package. They ALWAYS come right to the door and are always smiling and friendly. Such a contrast from our daily experience with Canada Post. Amazon sometimes has to use Canada Post to deliver and I have contacted them several times about our issues with Canada Post. But unfortunately they can't guarantee that they can only use their Amazon drivers for every package. So now when I order I am having my package shipped directly to the postal outlet so that I don't have to wait till the following day to pick it up.
Canada Post is no longer focused on Customer Service and I have complained to them several times but nothing is ever done to resolve the issues.
Even the workers at the postal outlet are feeling the impact of this recent change in the amount of parcels that are just dropped off by the carriers. They are extremely full and it takes a longer amount of time for them to find parcels due to the amount in their storage area.
Canada Post literally sucks these days and I can't imagine it is going to change any time soon."
"If there was a zero I would definitely have selected that, as 1 star is definitely too high a rating for Canada Post.

Their rates are ridiculous and when I am shipping personally, I find I have better service and rates through various courier agencies. Sadly, as a recipient I do not always have the luxury of choosing a courier over the postal service.

Also, their additional handling fees to the recipient for cross border packages are unacceptable. They claim it‚Äôs to recoup their cost for the duties and taxes, and for doing a simple math calculation. As far as recouping their costs, unless the recipient decided to throw their money away by never accepting the package, then Canada Post gets their money for the duties and taxes or the customer gets nothing. Paying $10 and up (handling fee) for a simple math calculation seems pretty steep to me, especially when it‚Äôs on a product of not much more value than their $10 fee.

I believe as a customer, I should have the option to either authorize the service Canada Post is providing and the cost associated with it, or decline the service and deal with the Cross Border Services Agency personally to potentially fill out documentation and pay any duties and taxes myself. It should be my decision as to how it is handled.

Their customer service is non-existent. Their is no actual assistance of any kind given, just their scripted explanation of why they can charge you these ridiculous amounts."
"I ordered something on amazon with 2 day shipping. I ordered it 8 days ago and the package has still not shown up. The tracking number says the package has arrived at the post office and they had it out for delivery but they decided to bring it back to the office and reschedule it for the next day. However, the next day they didn't even try to load it on the truck and they decided to reschedule again to the next day. Today IS that next day and usually they would have showed up by now. HORRIBLE service.

Edit: the mailwoman walked up to our door, knocked on it very lightly (even though there is a doorbell) and handed me my brother's package... She then smiled and went on her merry way. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH CANADA POST IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE."
Just a word of warning if you are considering shipping anything by Canada Post/Purolator.....they think it's faster and more efficient to send a package from Missassauga to Wallaceburg via Winnipeg/Edmonton/Winnipeg...and it's still in Winnipeg...11 days later. Hopefully it arrives before Santa!
Horrible horrible customer service. Was told 12 different things about the location of my package. Went all the way to the post office and it was not there. Then it said second delivery attempt (failed to deliver previously) and customer service yet again was telling me contradictory bs. Horrible postal service. very disappointed!!!!
"Absolutely the most despicable service. I ordered a Fitbit 9 days ago, guaranteed delivered in 5 days. Canada Post has had my package 'Out for Delivery' for over 24 hours. I understand it's holiday season and black Friday shipments are coming in hot, but just because there's more packages than usual, does not mean you can delay peoples packages. Get more workers! What if there are people out there with a package that means life or death? Like a special hospital machine that they need??? Absolutely NOT IMPRESSED. I still don't have my package."
"You would think that a mail company would leave a note on your door, if they missed you. Leave some sort of an indication that they were there in the first place. But with Canada post, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. The slightly ignorant mail company doesn‚Äôt understand how to a) leave a package at the frount door or b) send you an email that you missed your package. An email, a note, any will do. Don‚Äôt have me waiting there expecting a package when it‚Äôs sitting in a post office somewhere.
Considering this has now become a habit of Canada Post I would also highly recommend that Canada Post keep there Post offices open longer. Opening at 10 and closing at 5, is a ridiculously poor choice due to the fact that I end up gettting my packages myslef.
This issue may not happen everywhere, at every Canada Post but it is certainly happing at the Meadowvale Village Canada Post in Mississauga."
"If I had the choice to avoid EVERYTHING related to Canada Post, I would. Unfortunately they are the main mail carrier and that needs to change. They lie about ringing the doorbell to deliver a package when someone was clearly home, they lie about giving my package ""to my dad"" when my dad does not even have the keys to the mailbox, mail delivery guy started swearing at my mom but was protected by his boss because he told them she swore at him first, and among MANY other things.

For my Amazon packages, I specifically got them to add a note to my account to never deliver my packages through Canada Post because I pay for Prime and got guarantee 2 day delivery (Wednesday Nov 29), but when I never received it, Canada Post assured Amazon that I would be getting my package the next day (Thursday Nov 30), and I still have not received it.

I understand the holiday season is busy, but do not guarantee me a date if you cannot carry through with it."
NEVER USE CANADA POST......... poor customer service and ridiculous delivery times. I mailed a letter for international delivery and was told it would take 2-3 weeks to get the letter delivered as it was registered post. It has been more than a month so I called the customer service. I was talking to so-called supervisor Nicole and she was the MOST RUDE person you can talk to. She started asking unnecessary questions and hung up on me when I asked the status of my shipment. I should have used a RELIABLE COURIER SERVICE instead of Canada Post..........
"Use Purolator!!!!!!! Sent a VIP package via XpressPost to be delivered ""guaranteed"" next day. Day 3 the package is missing and no one at CP knows where it is. Soooooo disappointed. Online tracking system is stuck at three days ago status with no updates. Don't use Canada Post if you have an important delivery."
Incompetent! Couldn't deliver my package to me when I'm home all day and tosses it at some post office 7 miles away! I recently had surgery and now I have to move more than I'm able to just for my package! They didn't even leave a notice card!
I would give zero stars if I could! Most pathetic run company in Canada!!! You can't even make a complaint they don't care and get away with complete incompetency! I am not receiving my mail because of road construction but I was told Canada Post does not care! I am getting other peoples mail but they don't care. If I ran my business this way I would be bankrupt! Idiots at Canada Post!
Held my package in the Guelph facility for 3 buisness days when i paid for Xpresspost. They refused to refund.
"Ordered package the size of a loaf of bread online. Failed to deliver 4 times in a row with no knock at my door despite previous delivery being successful the first time.

Called support 4 times, each time they queued the package for redelivery and failed to knock all 4 times. Support eventually said they spoke to the courier who ""assured us they knocked"". I live in a 200 sq ft bachelor from the 50's, i can hear footsteps at the elevator. They did not knock, and I'm not going to pop my head out for every pair of footsteps. Worst customer experience I've ever had to date."
"Sent a package from Guelph downtown postal office to ChitChats express in Mississauga as I didn't have time to travel to drop it off in the next week or so. Sent October 30th, just did a standard tracked shipment. The office worker asked me what the value was thinking there was some what of an insurance added.

Well, a day went by, checked online tracking and it said it was delivered on the 31st to Brampton, so I called ChitChats to confirm delivery, and they said they didnt receive anything. So called Canada post to confirm, and they said it was delivered according to online. I called to create a case and said resolution date would be the 29th of November before any information is told to me...Great...

Just got an answer back on the 24th saying they confirmed the recipient didn't receive it and it is lost. If I had insurance they can pay me back the cost of the item if not I am SOL...Well I guess I am SOL since apparently I declined the insurance.

What the hell kind of business is allowed to receive money and an item of someones and can lose it without any responsibility? What the ???? I am at a loss of words to describe the amount of anger and disappointment I have towards Canada Post, Our national postal service. Lost all hope on shipping with Canada Post and will no longer use them, very sad to me I have to say that."
"Had an item shipped to me via xpresspost. Followed the tracking and everything seemed normal. Minutes after going out for delivery there's an error; ""Verifying Recipient Address - Possible Delay"". Fair enough, delays and issues happen. It's part of life.

Waited 24 hours and no change to the status. Before this, every step was recorded down to the exact minute. And now nothing. Was it corrected? Was it sent back?

I tried to look up customer support, and after going through many steps was directed to call the service number. After following the many steps in the service phone tree I'm then simply redirected back to the website for answers. The system appears to loop by design.

Called back and simply hit ""other"" as an option until I finally got a human voice on the line. The only information they had for me was the exact same information I already had from tracking page. I asked what the address issue was and was told they didn't know. I asked if I could have the number to the depot who discovered the mysterious issue and was told no.

At this point in the conversation, I have learned absolutely nothing about my package. I ask how I can remedy the situation and learn anything about what the actual issue was. I'm told my proper address has been given to the depot, that they would open an investigation and that they would call me. Also that my package would take an additional amount of time to be delivered because of that. Nobody ever called.

During this lengthy phone call, I was put on hold while they contact the depot. After a minute or so I'm told that nobody answered the phone. At a depot with hundreds of employees... for the largest mail carrier service in Canada... there's nobody there to answer the phone.

So at this point I still don't know any details about the issue, there's no way for me to find out those details, and the people who have those details are not answering the phone (despite being a massive national crown corporation). I also have no idea if I'm even going to get my package or when that would happen.

After several frustrating minutes, I hang up the phone. The following day I see an email from Canada Post with the subject ""Inquiry - Delivery options"" In the email, I am informed; ""We wish to inform you that all of the necessary actions in connection with your Canada Post Customer Service ticket have been completed and the ticket has been closed."" Below that is the Service Ticket Details which is literally just the subject line of the email, the tracking number, and the date.

I still know absolutely nothing about the issue other than it's an issue."
"I am a remote control aircraft hobbyist, Canada Post has gotten unbelievably bad. I order items that often come from the US or overseas. With tracking I see them enter the country and then they get stalled. They sit in Richmond BC for weeks. Jon Hamilton of Canada POst blames the boxes. I can show clearly labelled boxes that were delayed 12 weeks. He also says you get what you pay for. That is complete BS because I have found it makes no difference how much you pay for shipping. The same package that was clearly labelled was also shipped with tracking priority. Even worse is the crappy attitude of their drivers. I had a 2500 piece of electronics left on my doorstep even though it said in big letters SIGNATURE REQUIRED DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED, And to add to their incompetence Canada Post marks packages as delivered as soon as they get loaded onto the truck. Twice now they have lost packages that were marked as delivered. In one case I got them on the phone same day as it was a $400 item. They told me they cannot contact drivers and to be honest the employees dont really care if they lost the package. Words you will never hear from their managers like Jon Hamilton are ""we are striving to improve"". Read the article where he was interviewed and laid the blame for delayed packages on the shippers and consumers. In private business they would fire him but with guys like him at Canada Post it's now wonder we have crappy service. The story can be found by searching on delayed mail canada post."
"The heading on this page reads: Help Canada Post Improve. In my opinion our reviews are for our ""customers"" education. Canada Post does not really give a dam. They are awful to the max. I live in an apt building, 15th floor, but that doesn't matter once you're in the elevator -4 of them- so the mail man comes to the door and I say: Do you have a parcel for me? -No, go tomorrow and pick it up at the Post Office, he says. I couldn't believe my ears. But he didn't give me a notice either, so my wife and I left to pick up our kids at school and at our return he had posted a pick up notice on our door because he had attempted a delivery. That's lying!
Today I went to the Post Office and picked up the item, it weights 0.1 pounds and that has to be with all the wrapping because it is a puddle light for a F150 pick up truck. Those things are minuscule!
Also while there, I picked up another item for me, that was today Nov. 22/2017. The funny thing is that on the Canada Post app and website it says that such parcel is still in Montreal; go figure. CP gave me a parcel and they post it as ""in transit"" in another province.
I could bore you with more atrocities but you guys are not going to believe me...."
"Terrible. So many lost packages, delayed packages, mail delivered to my neighbour down the street and I'm getting my other two neighbours' mail. Incompetency at its worst form. Definitely worse after privatization. Whoa can't believe I'm giving credit to the former gov't entity but yes it's gotten so much worse over the years. Such a joke. Other countries don't have such a failure of a post system."
"Oh dear, I am in tears from laughing at Canada Post's jobber 5% rating here! (LOL isn't 1/5 the lowest you can do?)

So, I sell part time on eBay and just recently, a buyer opened a dispute for not receiving his item I had shipped on Sept. 24.

I ended up refunding him the amount he paid via PayPal to have the case closed. It turns out he only received his item yesterday (Nov 20th) but this buyer was honest, and he refunded me back the money I had initially refunded to him, having paid for it on Sept. 22nd.

So what, it took nearly 2 months to ship to the United States via 'Small Packet Air USA' from Alberta?? What a joke. The customer service at the 2 locations I frequent are mediocre at best. Rude, argumentative and stand off-ish no matter which clown is at the front. One time I asked them to tape a shipping label to a box and they were pointing at their $3 packing tape on the side wall and wouldn't spare 2 feet worth of tape. A bum postal office with luxury pricing on their services and supplies. Overpriced and unfortunate as they are still the cheapest in town (E.g. in Edmonton).

P.S. I ended up buying that tape as I was in a rush and needed to send the package off that day, but boy does that tape ever suck. Just like with Canada Post, it couldn't do its job properly and barely stuck on the box I was trying to seal."
"I ordered a new phone from Koodo which would be shipped via Canada Post. All mailing information was entered correctly. By tracking the item I could see it was shipped from Mississauga Ontario. I live in Milton Ontario which is close to Mississauga. The expected delivery date goes by and still no package. Delivery progress isn't updated for another three days. I notice that for some bizarre reason my package is in Richmond British Columbia.

I call Canada Post and they file a ""service ticket"" which takes almost half an hour to process. I'm told I'll be contacted within sever days for an update (I've already been waiting a week). I'm not sure what a service ticket is exactly but from what I can gather, it looks like a pointless step to make it appear that they're doing something. I'm going to have to wait regardless.

So a phone being shipped from Mississauga to Milton, which is literally a fifteen minute drive, is going to take two weeks. Nice."
"Awful awful awful. No help at all, then I am told I have a 24 hour window when my packages reaches Canada to call them. Wow!!!! Why do we bail this crap out. Let them go under and use any other company!!"
They lied about the delivery date. The online tracking listed the item we received today (Nov 19/17) as having been delivered on Nov. 16/17 which is false. We tracked this item every day and there were no entries aside from Nov. 13th (Electronic information provided by the shipper AND iteme picked up by Canada Post in Mississauga). Then nothing until today. Now there are fraudulent and false entries about the item being processed on Nov. 15/17 then the item being out for delivery on Nov. 16/17 and finally the item being delivered on Nov. 16/17. None of those entries existed prior to today which indicates Canada Post is back dating deliveries which were not actually made. This is fraud pure and simple. When I went to report the issue on their website all I got was a message to contact the sender. Pathetic.
"UNNACEPTABLE, UNNACEPTABLE, UNNACEPTABLE. It is the SECOND time that the mail lady REFUSES to deliver my package at my door while I‚Äôm pregnant with complications that limit my movements. I‚Äô m the mother of a 19 month old and 7 month pregnant with my second. I work from home so I‚Äôm there to receive the packages I order. I order stuff for my child online because it is more convenient for me. I live on the 4th floor of an appartement building that has a FUNCTIONNING ELEVATOR. The lady rings my bell, I open the door for her and she refuses to go up. I opened the door TWICE and ADVISED HER THAT I‚ÄôM PREGNANT. She says she doesn‚Äôt care that the baby is not yet born so therefore I can go out to pick up MY HEAVY PACKAGE. SHE LEFT A CARDBOARD IN MY DELIVERY MAILBOX FOR ME TO GO PICK UP MY PACKAGE THE NEXT DAY AT A DRUGSTORE WHILE I WAS UPSTAIRS WAITING FOR IT!!!! I already called to complain twice and they DON‚ÄôT GIVE A DAMN. I will file a complaint with human rights commission."
"My parcel has been in Richmond, and according to tracking it has been processed, yet it has been in Richmond for 10 days now. Also according to the tracking, I was to receive the package 5 days ago. When I called to inquire as to why it hasn't moved from Richmond, I was very rudely informed that I would need to contact the sender/seller and get them to start an investigation. I cannot reach the sender and when I called for additional help/advice I was very rudely informed that there was nothing that they would do for me. I have also since then read online about other people's experiences and it seems that the consensus is that anything that goes through Richmond, stays in Richmond. Canada post is horrendous."
"MAILS NOT DELIVERED DUE TO...
FYI to everyone..if you find any cardboard box with a note written CLOSE/FERME inside your mailbox, it means Mr delivery man had no space to put your new letters/package. No initiative
Thanks to their customer service personnel who knows about their procedure regarding ""cardboard note"" way of notifying customer , or else I will end up getting my mails after a month or so if I didn't know about this procedure. She just told me to remove the ""cardboard"" and Mr mailman will start doing his JOB again.

If you're going on vacation/conference/tour/cruise you have 2 bosses to notify, Canada post is one of them.."
Terrible service from mail hold to customer service at the 145 West Mall station and how they behave and how they don't care - just terrible. Not returning my calls either - they said within 5 biz days someone would call but after a week no one called. Just a lousy service that is OVERPAID.
"I have lost track of how many times Canada Post has lost or misplaced my packages within the last year. I use a Canada Post Flex delivery address at one of the postal outlets and have stopped going into the Main Post Office in Swift Current due to one individual on the desk that is obnoxious and rude, if you want anything more than a stamp he likely will not help. During a telephone conversation with a supervisor at that location I mentioned the issue with the employee and this supervisor knew right away who I was referring to without me mentioning a name and indicated they are very aware of the issue but the union backs him. Fortunately this supervisor is very caring and helpful and has helped me track down several packages that ended up at the wrong place. Typically the tracking on these packages will just stop anywhere from Toronto, Winnipeg, or Regina and even after I receive the item tracking is not updated. On top of this I have had several completely disappear, one that showed up a month late, one that sat at a wrong location for 2 months and one that showed up 4 months later.
I could understand the odd error when you consider the volume Canada Post deals with but when this happens more than 50% of the time that signals a major problem. If CP does not get it together they will soon find that people will find other carriers."
"I would give Canada Post zero stars but the system won't let me. Lesson learned -- for expedited next day delivery to the United States do not use Canada Post. We paid 'extra' for next day delivery to the US. Tracking history showed the package leaving Canada Post Vancouver then being delivered to Fed-Ex Vancouver 1 full day after the scheduled delivery date in the US. When we asked for a refund Canada Post said it was not their fault (when clearly it was) and directed our call to Fed Ex. Thankfully Fed Ex were awesome and gave us a refund even though it was not their fault. Side note: Once Fed-Ex received the parcel they delivered it in less than 24 hours.

Calling Canada Post to complain was no better, the agent was USELESS, she actually said, and I quote ""3 days, that's not bad"" !!!!! but we paid for next day delivery!!!

Are they not aware that we as consumers have multiple options, rest assured we are finished with Canada Post as this is just one of many instances, the final straw."
Completely pathetic. Apparently the label on my package got destroyed and they were unable to deliver on the expected delivery day. They never called me to verify the address or anything. After I called them all they said that was my package was last on their priority and it would take 5 days for someone to call be back to verify the address.. Seems rather insane for an address that was correct in their system anyways. They could have easily called the depot to verify the address. I have had nothing but bad experiences with Canada Post these last few months.
"Absolutely pathetic money hungry creeps,they are so effing pathetic that they can see internal tracking for international registered airmail items however they never let the customer know about delivery status of such packages simply so that they can make ecommerce sellers bleed by asking them to upgrade to expedited service so that they can earn more money .Their CEO is nothing but a disgrace.They dont have a minimum basic courtesy of providing tracking which incase of registered international airmail happens to be most top service globally and all countries provide this tracking absolutely FREE of cost since that is the basic standard in today's world."
"Absolutely pathetic, not only did I wait almost 3 weeks to get my shipment due to it being ‚Äúlost in transit‚Äù when it did show up it looked like it had literally been run over! The package was ripped open, items were missing and the ones that were still inside were crushed. They put a plastic bag over it and a response saying. It appears your packaged was damaged, sorry we do our best basically. Absolutely unacceptable garbage service, thanks for being next to completely useless Canada Post."
"If it wasn‚Äôt for the lovely postal workers in our area I would give a 0 . How can you sell express post when it takes just as long or longer than normal ? My package has been sitting in Richmond BC post office since Tuesday , it‚Äôs now Friday , so no hope for it being delivered until at least Monday or Tuesday at best !!!!!! So disappointed in Canada post"
"I would give 0 stars but it`s not possible to do it .

I went to a postal office to deliver a package to Brazil, once I got there I had a bunch of options as tracked, express delivery, normal delivery...as I wanted the package to be delivered earlier and I wanted to track it (due Brazilian bad mail postal service ~~ and now I know canada post it`s not trustworthy as well) I payed extra to an express and tracked delivery.

I payed arround $80 Canadian dollars for the service. I shipped the item on October 15th and the item was supposed to arrive on November 2nd. During the whole time between the 15th of october and 2nd of November there was no update on the website, it only showed as ""Item accepted at the Post Office"". Now it`s November 11th and no changes. I opened a ticket on the website and it says they will have a resolution by January 31st.....really? are you kidding me???. So I called the help line and Stefanni said that they cannot do anything, and I have to wait, because the item will be scanned when arrive to my destination. AGAIN...REALLY??

DO NOT EVER USE CANADAPOST, PLEASE....PAY MORE FOR USP OR ANY OTHER COURIER SERVICES.....wish I knew it before using canada post. Not only delivery service is bad your customer service is worst...."
"Canada Post provides the worst service ever. They are unreliable, and do not take any responsibility for their horrendous service. I have not have a single good experience with Canada Post. I wish we had other options."
THEY NEVER DELIEVER PARCELS TO OUR DOOR OR EVEN TRY TO DELIEVER . WE ARE ALWAYS HOME ON THE DAYS WE ARE EXPECTING AN DELIEVERY. INSTEAD THEY LEAVE A NOTICE CARD WITH WE TRIED TO DELIEVER BUT NONE WAS HOME . THAT IS A BOLD FACE LIE. I HOPE CANADA POST READS THIS . THEIR SERVICE STINKS. WE LIVE IN AN APRTMENT BUILDING IN BROCKVILLE ONTARIO. THERE IS EVEN A BUZZER LOCATED OUTSIDE THE DOOR SO THEY CAN BUZZ TO SEE IF WE ARE HOME BEFORE CLIMBING THE STAIRS. AS I SAID THEY NEVER EVER ATTEMPT T O DELIEVER OUR PARCELS & OUR SHIPPING ADDRESS IS OUR HOME ADDRESS. PLEASE SHOW THIS TO CANADA POST . WE ALL PAY CANADA POST WORKERS SALARIES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SO THEY WORK FOR US. SO WE A RE THEIR BOSSES IN A WAY.
"The worst part of being a Canadian is having to deal with Canada post. They are horrible and take 0 accountability for failing to deliver your item. I love ordering things online but refuse to do so if my order is going through canada post. I ordered a $600 dollar camera which needed signature to receive they delivered it to the wrong place, where? They don't know. On top of that they accepted the signature of a random person with a completely different name and that's that. Never got my money back or saw that camera. Recently I ordered some apparel for my boyfriends birthday gift, got a delivery notice to pick it up, went to the postal office uhhh SURPRISE they don't have it. Told to call their service number to investigate and the woman tells me she's putting urgent priority on it takes my number so i can get calls on the status of my package all this BS ofc because after no notification I go to the post office the next day and they still don't have it. I get told to call the number they tell me to go to the post office when the last tracking information on it is 3 days ago saying its on route to my post office. So obviously my package was lost and no one wants to actually find out where it is. How many more centuries is it going to take for you guys to get a handle on mail delivery? Take notes from DHL and get some professionalism."
Went to send two small packages to some family members so I grabbed a couple Canada post envelopes to send them in. After already writing the address on the packages the lady at the counter told me the price to ship and it was outrageous. But since I already wrote on the envelopes I had to pay for them even though I no longer wanted their service. Would not teccommend. Worst costumer service and way to expensive
"I had a package sent to me with the wrong unit number on it. I realized 2 days after it was shipped that there needed to be a correction so I called their contact line. The package was sitting in Victoria where I live but they wouldn't allow me to pick it up and they could not change the address to the correct address. I could drive 5 minutes to the package and just pick it up with ID. To make matters worse the person I was talking to was super rude and short. I needed the package to go hiking with my friends and was shocked how uncreative Canada Post was to correct a wrong address during shipment. It was like the call center could do absolutely nothing but tell me what they couldn't do, at least explain why you can't do something rather than telling me it's company policy, and at least be nice to me while explaining..... very bad experience."
"I hate that you're completely reliant on having a good mailman in your area in order to have adequate service and honest delivery.

My awesome canada post person stopped working in my area(they did a great job and were also just super nice). But the new person who replaced them is pulling all the typical Canada Post BS. Marking things as delivered but never dropping them off, getting pick up notifications for expensive express packages that were marked to be dropped off(them having never rang the doorbell or knocked at all), it's goddamn frustrating.

Canada post is also just unbelievably slow and unreliable in general, and they'll charge you an arm and a leg for the privilege of having your packages arrive late and damaged.

Canada post needs a massive overhaul."
Ordered a product needed for a job. I am a small.business owner. Had the item shipped via Canada post express post with a guaranteed delivery of the following day before 7 pm. I paid an employee to wait for.the.package from 8 am to 7 pm @$22 per hour (plus mercs). The item never.arrived. called Canada post was told it would be delivered the following day first thing.as.soon as the truck went out. It's now 244pm I'm on hold with Canada post and the item has still not been delivered. So now I have just paid another employee $22 an hour for 6 more hours and still no product. If your a small business and need items shipped rush for a job DO NOT USE CANADA POST!!! worst experience ever! And customer service didn't seem to understand that it just.cost.me profit from the job.in question having to pay an employee to sit and.wait a.second.day. horrible Canada post shame on you. Your largest market is small business owners. And you just kick us in the teeth.
"I was given a card to pick up item. I have limited mobility and it is snowing outside. I was available by the door and no one delivered my package to me, no door bell and no knock on the door. Please deliver my package by today, it would help me very much and fix this mistake. November 1st, 2017.

PS All phone attempts have failed. This is intolerable service. Just deliver it TODAY the way it was supposed to be delivered, to my door.

They did not deliver and they expect me to hike 3 miles on foot to get my package (which I cannot do), effectively holding it hostage."
"Unresolved Complaint
The outlet I went to had a new staff member that should not have been left on her own yet. I was sending a parcel to California for a return worth $80. I needed the parcel to be traceable and the clerk went through the process of punching in the value into the POS and entering my address information. After everything had been processed my receipt show the parcel can not be tracked. There was a survey on the bottom of the receipt so I sent in my concern that was unanswered. So, I could be out $80, the cost of the postage and the clothing I mailed."
They don't bother to knock or buzz your house to let you know that they're there with your package.. They would much rather write a pick up ticket and take your order to the post office rather than attempt a delivery. What's the point in paying for express shipping when they don't even attempt to deliver it in the first place? Very poor customer service.
"The staff is always polite, very helpful and friendly."
"Canada Post is slowly going out and there is a reason for that! They don't recognize they are in a competitive field now. WE do have other options and anyone who needs a letter delivered in a timely manner or a professional manner should surely choose Purolator or UPS for their mailing choices. I find it absolutely ridiculous how it can take 7-14 days to mail a birthday card from Ontario to Buffalo. Or if you are mailing within Ontario it can take up to 5 days from city to city.

To top it off, I recently mailed a letter by X-Press Post and the letter was returned to me. I paid close to $25.00 to have this letter sent to arrive within 3 days and it was travelling from Ontario to British Columbia. I actually had to pay to request 3 day service within Canada. But, for multiple reasons the letter wasn't picked up by the receiver. The letter was returned to me. Imagine my surprise when I arrived to pick it up to find out that I had to repay the original amount to get my letter back??? The bottom line is that I had to pay nearly $50 to send a letter from Ontario to B.C. in 3 days which never got received. I know for a fact you can mail in the U.S. from coast to coast and it is generally received within 3 days by regular mail. You don't have to pay an extra fee for 3 days service UNLESS you are on a strict deadline and want to ENSURE the 3 days.

The really obscene side of this is that the CLERK didn't advise me of that fee when she took my original $25.00. No one told me it was a gamble that I do double or nothing. I did call Customer Service at 1-800-267-1177 and was advised that oh yes there is that double your money fee and guess what.... IT SAYS SO ON OUR WEBSITE! So now we must be aware of what the website says before we take a chance with any service with Canada Post.

Furthermore, you have to deal with rude and incompetent clerks at nearly every location. No matter where I have been in Ontario visiting a Canada Post outlet I have been sorely disappointed. I seldom get a smile or a thank you. I get partial or completely wrong answers and half the time I have to go home and get on the internet and dig through the Canada Post website to get the correct answers.

Needless to say this last time I dealt with them was the LAST time I will initiate a transaction with Canada Post. I will take my business to the competitors as I know that at least they recognize they are a business for the people.

I truly believe that Canada Post believes they own the market for mailing in Canada so they don't have to follow best practices or do special training for customer service employees. Their business model is one that has been driven by necessity yet necessity is going down and down as people just don't mail like they used to. I feel Canada Post should absolutely work on some basic skills and learn what it means to need the business. It is a money racket and that's it!

Please.....STOP USING CANADA POST AND USE THE COMPETITORS! Force Canada Post to change their ethics and policies. Force them to smile at us as they rip us off. Or thank us for our business at the minimum. I surely don't think that is too much to ask for."
"WORST Postal service EVER....avoid using at all costs.....I work from home and these people won‚Äôt even knock on my door and just leave door tags....totally LAZY and UNPROFESSIONAL....why am I paying
Shipping costs????????
If that‚Äôs not bad enough on more than one occasion the door tag tells me to pick up after 1:30 the following day and on 4 separate occasions to be exact....I go as directed and it‚Äôs not there?????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME????
I even filed formal complaints and went to the ombudsman and no one seems to care and I have been awaiting a response for 2 months now....typical government service....so disgusting and appalling.....please please please use another carrier for your shipping/receiving needs...don‚Äôt waste your money they will only waste your time"
"Very poor customer service.

I recently experienced an issue where Canada Post was involved as a third party in the shipping of an item from the United States. The sender, the original company and Canada Post all failed to inform me that my package would be transferred from the shipping company I expected the package would be delivered from to Canada Post with a different tracking number.

Not only were the representatives ill equipped to deal with customer complaints, they were unprofessional. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was simply transferred to another representative. This representative provided no solutions and was argumentative. They seemed ill informed of processes in place (that I have used before). They also did not disclose their employee numbers (any method to identify themselves) or document their involvement on my file for me to prepare a meaningful complaint. There was a strong sense that accountability measures were not in place leaving a very negative view of how this government agency is run. I think staff at Canada Post, certainly the individuals I dealt with this day, may have forgotten who they are intended to serve."
"It time canada to tell the truth about canada post,incompaten.unproffesional.lies dception,and money the make off these work habbits,mixing up mail at community mail boxes.they break so many laws disrupt service,they should be investegated,charged and thrown in jail! How many people's lives have they disrupted ruined. Because of these mishaps.it's time the government did their duty and do something to stop this .I should apply for this job,I think the president is Biggest idiot brain dead if that what it takes to be Perez then any monkey can do this job,the lives b.s. and no idea customer support is a lark.they don't know a Damn thing.they must be all hopped up on dope."
"Terrible service
Using their ""FlexDelivery"" option, never got any notification that my parcels had arrived - they were returned to sender.
Avoid if you Can."
Absolute trash. Worst postage service in North America
"Shipped my computer from Canada to New Zealand. Spent $350 and got up to $1000 in insurance. It was packed securely, it had fragile stickers on it just in case. Of course it arrived with a cracked case, refusing to start and giving graphical artifacts. I attempted to get at least some insurance money back, hoping it wouldn't be a total waste of time and money.

Of course Canada Post said it was my fault. Because, y'know, when I ship something valuable to me, I want it to break and I love spending more money to replace what was broken. Crooks. Take some responsibility."
awful use puro or fedex or anything butt this company it is the worse and customer service is even worse like how they arnt run by dummies or monkeys wouldn't surprise me take weeks instead of days for a package or even mail snail mail and customer service is awful
"I posted a important parcel containing documents from Montreal to Sydney NS. with XpressPost , have been told that it takes two days, now it has been more than 10 days and based on the last information it's on transit in MISSISSAUGA, ON ! I called them several times , they opened a ticket and .. but no real information or explanation what's going on. I'll never ever use Canada post."
Canada Post has gone right down hill. Post man has screwed up so many of my deliveries. My package was suppose to be delivered Friday and now it‚Äôs for today (Monday). Cool no problem one day isn‚Äôt a big deal. My tracking said that the parcel was left at front door. Nope not there. Went to see at the community mail box and it was in one of the larger ones. The key does work to open the box to retrieve my parcel. Call Canada Post to be told that someone will now call me Wednesday for future instructions for when I can get my parcel and that it‚Äôs not the mail mans fault. Hmm. Same box worked fine last week. Thanks Canada Post. I‚Äôll go with another company to ship instead next time. This also doesn‚Äôt count when last year all my Xmas presents were almost sent back because of the post man not giving me notice or me recieving other peoples mail on a regular bases.
Bad service...returned a package without reason... arrogant entitled response from front service agent at local postal office.
"sent a package from toronto to india using priority. these guys gave my package to fedex (the worst postal company in the world) who in turn lost my package and just kept making me call back to customer service every single day for like 15 days before they told me that they lost the package. A lot of time (more than a month) and money wasted (around 500$ in total) and nothing actually delivered.
PS- the package was a book which my bro needed for his exam which is why i used priority and now he has to miss it and wait another 6 months because these geniuses couldn't deliver it and lost the book."
"Karen one of the Surrey BC managers told me after i brougt to her attention that for the last month we have had over 80 pieces on mail correctly addressed but misplaced by their postal workers into the wrong suites mail boxes that ""reading the mail is to hard for mail postal workers to do when delivering mail to the correct suite in an apartment complex"" extremely unacceptable , unprofessional, and not to mention also a federal offense miss delivering mail."
"The current system is error proned and relies on ""honesty"" . From leaving key to open parcel box (what if the postman puts the key in the wrong recipient's mail box, the dishonest person can pick up the parcel?) to delivery to the incorrect address (if you are lucky, honest people will return the parcel to the rightful recipient; otherwise , you are screwed and the postman does not take blame for it and goes on with his job with the wrong attitude).

Also, they no longer keep record of SAL (small packet) delivery from other countries even if SAL is purchased with tracking. If Canada Post doesn't keep records , who can track the parcel, the country of origin can not do anything about it without Canada's postal tracking records?

Why do they even exist? This is a disgrace . Canada Post is still a government owned entity , it represents Canada. When I told my friends that Canada Post does not have door-to-door mail delivery as in all other so called FIRST WORLD countries , they were all shocked!

What kind of people do they employ? No sense of professionalism and they take no responsibility, yet the CEO is still getting his bonuses!? I hope they get screwed by their service !

NO STAR rating from me !"
"Ordered a new set of keys for my community mail box. It is 10 days later. After multiple phone calls to the service center, being on hold for at least an hour over the last few days and on the phone with morons at least 2 hours on top of incompetent staff dropping the calls, and being told keys are at my local depot to pick up, then to get there and they aren‚Äôt... I digress. I still have to important packages sitting at the end of my Crescent. I can‚Äôt get them out without the keys so I can get into the community boxes at the bottom for larger parcels. The Red Deer office called and told me the lady that does rekeying was backed up and would do it today. Give me a break, I had a tracking number for the keys on Monday, you idiots lost them and now lie and tell me she‚Äôs backed up?! So after being assured they would be there today, I have a card left on the doorstep this morning, and have called 2x, and surprise!! No keys. Worst service I‚Äôve ever received, and you have the gull to charge me $29 for keys after you guys effed up. I ordered a parcel with fedex three days ago, and it was on my doorstep this afternoon all the way from Quebec, and I‚Äôm in Alberta. I hope they go broke. These useless pencil pushers need to be jobless."
It seems the person they hired to deliver packages in my neighborhood can't read street names or numbers. Home all day says package delivered but no package. Filed a complaint but was told only the seller could initiate claim. Fortunately a kind hearted soul brought me the package that was delivered to her address that night. No accountability for the delivery person which should be fired. I was out walking my dog the other night after 5 pm and I saw a gentleman constantly looking at his cell phone driving really slow. Seemed very lost and yes the back of his car was filled with Canada Post packages. Still haven't received my next package that was due by expedited courier two days ago. God knows when or where that will show up.
Tried to complete survey at canadapost.ipsosinteractive.com . It does not exist! No wonder they are in deep deep trouble
"Horrible service! Delivery people do not knock and deliver your package and this has become a repeated occurrence. Today, we were sitting in the living room when we heard the mail sloth move, my mom peeped out but no one was there. A few mins later just on a hunch she decided to open the door and there on the floor is a package which happened to be a textbook I had ordered. Now because of the inefficiency and laziness of Canada Post's staff packages are at the mercy of the honesty of others to not be thieves, especially when there are no cameras in the building. Reliable and quality service is not too much to ask when said service has been paid for. Customers deserve more for their money. Get it together Canada Post!"
"Giving one star as there are negative stars. Canada Post service costs more than it ever did and the service has eroded to the point it is a joke.. You try and make a complaint online and unless your complaint is one of the many cookie cutter complaints you are basically screwed. Hard to find a telephone number and if you do manage to get through the personal is angry and hostile before you even get a chance to voice your concern. Apparently they no longer deliver packages to the doors of high rise buildings as they are too busy; there are only 8 hours in a day; it would take 3 minutes to deliver each on; now company policy. On and on with excuses. They're past company policy was to say they buzzed you and they really didn't and you have to pick up the parcel at the post office anyway. Little do these fools know that when I know a delivery is coming I STAY HOME. And take the phone everywhere with me. Even the bathroom. Sounds odd but I'm not very mobile and it is very difficult for me to get around. That's why I purchase online--for the convenience.
I will not purchase from a company now if they will not courier with someone other than Canada Post. What a shame really. Already complained to Canada Post, they don't give a rat's behind."
"I have been waiting for a package that fits in letter mail, coming from Ontario for 6 weeks! I am only in Nova Scotia! I feel like #canadapost is purposly slow so we will get fed up and pay for expidited shipping."
Disgraceful. Absolutely disgraceful 'service'.
"I went today at 8:45pm to pick up parcel, but stuff working there told me it is already closed, despite others already waiting there.
I asked for explanation since it is open by 9pm but got very arrogant and cynical answer and was told to leave.
Awful customer service from their side. They would not survive at any other private corporation. I work for the city, where you have to exceed level of customer service and expectations."
They lose or deliver mail to the wrong address regularly with no accountability. There is no way to report to an actual person or obtain or request and explanation or update. It costs businesses/individuals significant money to stop payment on lost cheques but the employee who messed up on the delivery faces no consequence and still cashes in on taxpayer money and pensions. There is no better business than a government backed business!
"Honestly don't know how they are still in business, I avoid them every chance I get. Nothing is delivered on time and when it's delivered they don't put the key in your mailbox to get your packages, and from there since they didn't put the key in is a whole long investigation involving having the seller contact them. God only knows when I'll get the package , been a month already."
"I don't know why I am bothering to write this review....clearly Canada Post doesn't care about customer service at all as every single review out of 100's on here are 1 star...so my experience was clearly just business as usual for the superstars at Canada post. I shipped a package to Columbia a month a go , I was told it would arrive in two weeks. It cost me 120.00 dollars to send it in this time frame. The package was the size of a shoe box, it cost more to send the item then the contents of the package. After waiting 10 days I called to find out what was going on , only to find out that the two weeks I paid a fortune for was just an estimate that they couldn't tell me when it would arrive. They then tried to blame the delay on customs but retracted the statement when i pointed out it had only been in customs for a day. They then tried to blame the Colombia post office taking no accountability at all for the delivery. So I asked them to call the Colombia post office and find out what was going on and they told me I couldn't even open a complaint for another week! So my package has been missing for double the estimated time i was quoted and I cant even track it for another week??? Total BS ! What a scam!"
"Brought my package to the door, said I could only pay cash only. I didn't happen to have any at the time but the delivery man said it would be available for pickup at 5pm. So I went there around 6:30, and the clerk said it wasn't there without even hesitating, and without explaination. Moments before she was talking with some friends of hers that were picking something up, and I believe that she said it wasn't there just so she could continue her conversation."
What a joke. Was giving the wrong key for a parcel community lock box on a Friday. Went to the local post office and was told I'll have to wait till Monday until they will put the correct key in my mail box. So my expensive package is sitting inside a sweltering lock box in the sun for two days. Thank goodness I paid extra money to have it rushed to me. Thanks Canada Post.
"Where do I begin, first my package was a day late which can be understandable, I get that but when the delivery person came by with the package they didn't even ring my doorbell, I was home the entire time waiting for my package to be delivered and no one rang my doorbell, knocked, nothing! and then I had to wait another 24 hours to pick it up from an inconvenient post office even though this could've been avoided if the delivery person rang my doorbell. I'm very disappointed in the laziness of your delivery people and understand the convenience of community mailboxes."
Delivery staff rang my bell and left immediately. Does he has brain to expect us to answer the door immediately like we always stay by the door?
Don't deserve even 1 star because of their rude staff!
"Can't blame the staff since it's Canada post that implemented new rules for drivers but now we get packages at 8 pm vs 11 am before. I'm sorry but when a package is guaranteed for a specific date, why would waiting till 8pm count!? It's been worst these days and drivers look overworked. We are in the Gatineau (Templeton) area. They have to work on their express post service.

Service is just going down hill fast!"
"They don't deserve a star
Poor service. I sent a package using their express service and I was told it will get there the next day. The item never arrived at the recipient's address. I just saw it in my mailbox with a delivered status. ( I am the sender!)
They sent me an email in French that I do not understand. I called their customer service and after being unable to resolve, the agent said a supervisor would be reaching me the next day. It's about 3 weeks and no one called. No update. No reason provided on why item was not delivered. Nothing."
"Worst place to do business.
I thought it would be a good place to distribute my flyers and improve my business.

I thought wrong, Canada post does not care about small business.

I wasted my flyers and money, the customer service agent are very rude and not listening to complain.

They didn't distribute my flyers I checked all locations, they are deceiver and rude.

I will never do any business with Canada post will look local distributor.

I read the reviews and didn't believe, so I lost my money and flyers hopefully you shouldn't experience as I did.

Canada post Worst place to do business"
"Absolutely terrible business! This is every retailer's worst nightmare if you ship via Canada Post to your customers.
There are on going issues of product not being delivered, Customer Service gives the run around leaving you on hold for hours each day with no resolution. You are asked to create a ticket and spend 30 minutes explaining the situation only to call back and be told that the ticket number you were given doesn't exist and you have to start from the beginning again to create a new ticket and they cannot transfer you to a supervisor without an active ticket and notes.
I spent 17.5 hours on the phone with them over the period of 6 days and there is STILL no resolution!
People do not want to order product if it is being shipped via Canada post.

BUSINESS OWNERS BEWARE!

I wish this review allowed to give less than 1 star because 1 star is far too generous for this company."
"Terrible service, avoid if you want to see your parcel again."
To bad you can't give less than a star... Canada post managed to loose a phone I was sending back for a refund. When I tried to use their online tools the package it's self was claimed to have never existed. I found it nearly impossible to get in touch with a live representative as I was never able to get them on the phone. When I messaged them on Facebook they ignored me for about a week until I started spamming them with my questions. The issue was never resolved or apologised for. If at all possible stay away from Canada Post.
Canada post was very helpful an honest in sending my letter
"I've lived in Australia, UK, USA and Ghana, and Canada Post is by far the worst in terms of how long they take and rudeness of employees. I think Canada post ought to be ashamed of themselves over how ridiculously slow delivery is of ordinary mail and small (expedited!!?) parcels. Why so slow?"
"Their service is HORRIBLE, Canada Post doesn't deserve to have even a single star. I was led to believe that with their Xpress Post, the parcel will get delivered within 7 business days (7 days Max) I also paid for tracking for monitoring. It's been 3 weeks and the parcel is not yet there. THE WORST THING IS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE the parcel is. AFTER ESCALATING MY CONCERN, 2 clueless and useless supervisors said that the International Trace Department has to investigate. The first one said I can follow up after a week, and the 2nd one said I HAVE TO GIVE THEM 90 more days before they can give a concrete answer. Their service paled miserably in comparison to UPS & FedeX. The saddest part is they make signage in every Canada Post Outlet/ Store that they can deliver in 7 days - I think they should pull that signage out because it's a FALSE CLAIM, it's like advertising something that they can't back up with their service. If Canada Post doesn't have good clout with customs or international postal service, then, they shouldn't make a claim that they can deliver within 7 days! Before my call got escalated to the real Canada Post Supervisor, l have to go through pretentious ""know-it all"" call center representative who injects her own opinion about restricted items without fully understanding that I haven't sent anything that's restricted to the country of destination."
"they don't even deserve a star

my advise to you ... it is better for you to send through Fedex, or DHL but not Canada post because first they keep on changing their words i sent an envelope to the Philippines at the beginning they told me that it will arrive with 5 to 7 days and then they told me no it will arrive within 10 to 15 and when i called the customer service they told me you have to wait 3 or 4 weeks second when the senior representative called i told her i have a class can you later she was like no i just called to let you know that there is no compensation your envelope is suppose to be in the Philippines with 4 to 7 days but i don't know where it is and i can't help you because you sent it through regular mail and you don't have the tracking number which is a stupid reason because usually even if the customer doesn't have the tracking number and can't know where is their item the customer service SHOULD KNOW in order not to lose it because it is their responsibility to deliver it to the right because i paid them money to deliver it
but it seems i paid them just in order to take my envelope and lose it like a baby and they almost did the same thing to my friend"
"I want to lodge a complaint about the Canada Post service being offered at The Colonnade in Toronto on Bloor street.

I was picking up my parcel, but had misplaced the ticket that is left behind in our mailboxes when we are not home to accept the delivery. I was upfront and polite to the post office staff and even offered to return next week if the ticket was required. I offered my driving license so all the other information was available on hand. There was only one other person in the line behind me.

The staff member was extremely rude and scolded me that I was inconsiderate and was wasting his time. He proceeded to take information from my driver's license and it took him all of one minute to find my information and package. Another minute and I had paid the charge.

Are customers a waste of time for Canada Post??

I am also confused as to why I am assigned a post office that is farther away when there is a full service post office that is much nearer my home. This particular location has routinely had rude staff. I would like to be able to choose where my packages are taken and I would also like for the staff to be trained in basic customer service."
"canada post is the most expensive worldwide, with a service level under a 3. world country, on top the are f...arrogant."
"Your express post is horrible! People pay for shipments to be on time and you fail miserably. In the last 2 weeks I have had 1 parcel sit in Burnaby for a week before finally getting delivered. And now your late again...People pay for your service, rely on your service. The least you could do is treat the packages as if they are time sensitive.

...Im ordering medicine, if you say your going to deliver on a set date DO IT!"
"Ordered an item from the Philippines on February 22, 2017. The Tracking number could be followed until it left the Philippines by air on Feb 28. The parcel arrived at my door yesterday, September 06, 2017. That's more than six months sitting in Canada waiting to be delivered! Meanwhile the vendor refunded my money and stopped selling to customers in Canada because they're losing too much money refunding Canadian sales. I have returned his refund and we arranged to continue working together using alternate carriers.
I'm currently missing four parcels from Europe, one from Australia and one from China, all over four months overdue and, according to the originating mail services, sitting somewhere in Canada Post warehouses. Canada Post is damaging our business reputation around the world."
"Keep a record of damn tracking numbers, bills get lost easily I lost 430$ because of this stupidity"
"worst service ever ,postman does not even try to knock on door for a parcel ,they drop to pick up outside the door .What a joke"
"Awful service! Employees are not responsible for anything, parcels are not delivered and are not tracked on the site. I do not recommend anyone to deal with!"
"I paid nearly $100.00 to get mail forwarding since the clerk at the desk told me it is good to get the 1year service so if in case I have forgotten to change any Government documents or Financial Institute correspondence it will be forwarded to my new address. Now it has been nearly 3 weeks and I only got 2 pieces of mail, I have been on the phone so many times got a very rude representative, they opened a ticket and advised me someone will call as they see I should have got 7 to 9 pieces of mail, no one called me then when I called back this week Aug 25th after waiting on hold for 15mts they said they had closed my ticket saying it is resolved. What a big scam now another ticket has been opened and I am suppose to get a call from a supervisor, then I get an e-mail confirmation that I have amended the services and mail forwarding will be cancelled - this is so ridiculous and please do not get their services as I have to now take this up legally or please let me know how to get my money back, since this service should have been in effect 1st of August and so far I have only got 2 pieces up to Aug 25th. I do not recommend anyone to take their services since when I called they said that the postal clerk gave me wrong information since no Government mail or Financial mail will be forwarded."
"my aunt sent me a package from UK, tracked and signed and said to be delivered on the 14th day from the day it was sent. and now it's over a month and still dont have my package and they can't even track it. it only says that item is on its way to toronto ."
"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.
A package was sent by a friend of mine from trois-rivieres to Toronto and they said it would be three days for the package to arrive. It's been 14 days and the package is not even close to arrive. They said it would be given to me today, the day number fourteen but nothing has arrived."
"insurance worthless. tracking worthless.

In order to claim there insurance they need far too much proof.
Even if their own tracking is says the package is missing and the other side tried to open a claim they still require contact with the customer. For commercial or ebay customers with privacy rules. There is little or no direct contact with the customer so they are unable to verify things."
Shame on your Canada post my item from EU to Canada is arrived after over one month.
The worst people! I wish I could give 0 stars. If you are at fault they'll make your experience worse and if they are at fault they don't care what you are experiencing. I was about to get my courier on Friday but somehow I missed one thing in my address but the postal code was correct so they could have delivered it or called me as my contact number was there too but they didn't. Instead they returned my courier to the people from where I placed my order. And this happened within 2 hours. In the 3rd hour I talked to the company they said that I'll get the courier same day as they'll be sending it as Express delivery but thanks to Canada Post I didn't get that too! I cancelled all my plans for Friday just to receive the package. At last when I called Canada Post the person said that I'll be getting my package on August 21st which is Monday. Wow... this is the scenario of expired delivery! I wonder how many days they'll take to deliver the Standard one. Right now it's August 21st and 11:32 am and still I'm waiting for my courier since morning 9:30 am because on the tracking page it's showing that the item is out for delivery. On Friday until 10:44 am they have cancelled my shipping and already sent back the items. And for delivering my courier they are taking so much time! From now onwards I'm not going to select Canada Post in any case for any service!
"Worst service ever. F**king Delivery guy didn't ring the bell, just left notice. I ordered food item and chose Xpresspost so that it comes within 2 days. I didn't even go to washroom(since morning on delivery day in case I might miss the delivery) and was tracking the item every 10 min. Then found out the notice was left. I hate that F**king delivery guy, I hate F**king Canada Post"
"If I could give Canada Post a 0 I would! Awful service first and foremost ! I ordered an item a week ago and I was very excited to learn it had been delivered to ""me"" within two days. So of course I look at my front porch and there was nothing there. Now I order a desk so it would not be hard to miss. After calling Canada Post they assured me that my package was delivered to me. Funny enough I work from home and have a office looking into my front porch and I knew they hadn't delivered anything to me. Instead of trying to solve the problem they then told ME to contact Walmart ( where I purchased from ) to solve the issue because there was no way they were at fault. This morning I happened to see the Canada Post truck drive down my street and I asked the driver about my parcel ( thinking maybe it was left in the back of the Truck from the previous day ) he told me that the tag on the delivery slip was ripped so instead of trying to figure out where it went he dropped it off at the first house on the street and left !! Can you believe that ! So then I was told that the supervisor would contact the people who my product was delivered too. Instead they contact ME acting like i'm the person they wrongfully delivered the parcel to . I finally just went and found out the house my product was delivered to and politely explained the situation and ended up picking up my package from where it was wrongfully delivered. If I hadn't done that the individual who recieved my package would have never known who the rightful owner was ! Will NEVER use Canada Post again!! Terrible customer service and unwilling to help anyone who has a problem. Truely pathetic."
"Just emigrated to Canada and having a terrible time adjusting to the awful postal service here! Had a couple of bad experiences with Canada post previously when visiting, but brushed them off as one offs or mistakes, now realising this is just the overall quality of the service.

I recently ordered a printer from Best Buy which should have been delivered to my apartment. I sat in all day on the expected day of delivery but nothing came. I checked the tracking at the end of the day only to find out they supposedly made a delivery attempt in the afternoon and I would now have to walk (I have no car) to the post office to collect it and carry it home. No missed parcel slip was left, no calls to my number (which was on the parcel) and no genuine attempt to actually deliver the item was made. I called them up to complain about this and was told that they can't attempt a second delivery. I pointed out there hadn't been a first but they simply kept saying over and over again that a delivery was attempted but failed and that this is my fault as despite never asking for it before I hadn't provided them a buzzer number (even though I provided them a phone number and they've never needed one before when they've delivered items to us.) They told me they are ""unable"" unless you are disabled and have literally no one else who can go and collect it, later I was offered another delivery attempt (no guaruntee) but it wouldn't be for another 5-7 working days.
Other fun things included a worker who told me he didn't know if my postage label bought from etsy was 'valid' and told me I could ""put it in the post box and see what happens."" Even after telling him it was a purchase from my online store and as such needs to get where its going. Very much not his problem.
I'm sure there are some pleasant people working at Canada post but I am yet to find one in my dealings with them. They have all been short to the point of being borderline rude.
The fact that postage WITHIN Canada costs more than posting something to the states is absurd. The prices are extortionate without the service to back it up.
There's very little that makes me miss living in the UK, but this postal service has me genuinely considering shipping my online store items all the way back home to have them sent from there."
"No updates, impossible to actually speak to someone. It's currently day 17 of an express 4-7 day service. The update page is still telling me the expected delivery date is the 11th, it's now the 16th??!!"
"We have been using Canadapost for many years. Our business ship about 20k a year with Canadapost. Today I called as we have been over charged on every shipping label we create online. 0.62, 0.31, 0.83 We have input the size which are the actual measurements. After speaking on the phone ""worst customer service ever may I add"" I was told that we are being charged these fees as the boxes are measured and they could be off by 1 cm.
This is false. I ship the items and if something is 25.5 I use 26cm in our measurements.
They informed me that I can dispute these small extra fees although there would be a charge if it came back that the sizes measured were accurate on their end......
This nickle and dime extra fees has pushed our company to take our 20k a year and give it to another shipping carrier.
Worst customer service ever on the phone.
I am sure there will be many companies moving there shipping business elsewhere with service like this.
This is how you force your customers to take your business and move it elsewhere."
"Waiting for parcel from last 5 days. Worst service in surrey, vancouver."
"lots of crap reviews here probably from single bad experiences, but I can't get over all of the good experiences. Honestly I run a business Loresk.com and I have things sent almost everyday all around the world and Canada post has never messed up an order, not once. I have had terrible experiences with fedex smartpost being once handed over to USPS. They messed up every single order time and time again, but not Canada Post. Very reliable and fast. The prices for IN province shipping is too high in my opinion, I can send a shirt out of province like 1000 kms for 15 bucks or i can send it 50 km away and its still 13 bucks, that to me should be fixed but beyond that, great services and the workers care about their jobs (careers)."
"I am currently on the phone with Canada post that is located in Edmonton on James Mowatt and 110 Street SW, they asked me hold on a minute, but it's been 40 minutes now and the woman who is currently working there has just forgotten about me.

It's August 9, 2017, 7:35 PM, I have been on hold since 6:55PM!!!! She (the Canada post worker) is having a lot of fun as she is laughing. And she just hang up on me!"
"Terrible experience.
I was expecting a package at home. As the mailman comes he drops a delivery notice and DOESNT BOTHER TO KNOCK! I run outside after him and call him out... he obviously doesn't hear me as he is wearing headphones! He hops in his truck and drives away.
I call the office to know how I can get my hands on my package and they tell me to come and get it at 6pm that day. I get there at 7, it is not ready for pickup. It was sitting in the back with other packages but hadn't been sorted.
The man tells me to come back in an hour. I come back two hours later, still nothing. He says come back tomorrow morning. I come in the afternoon the next day: STILL NOT READY!
Nobody cared, the guy behind the counter was chilling with one of his friends at the desk, barely spoke to me.

Huge waste of my time, by far the worst customer service I have had. Please do something about this.
Thanks for nothing Post Canada"
"30+ dollars to ship within Canada a 1 pound parcel. Took 5 days to make it, no advance warding of home delivery leading to missed door delivery and no place to pick-up until next day.

This was best in class service 30 years ago. Time to evolve or die. This is a re-occuring theme. Costs time and money to both delivery service & customer. Also makes for very poor experience. I'm willing to pay but give proper service. When pizza delivery industry is better at deliveries than you, consider using them to do your work."
"Email Notification says that : 2017/08/08 14:35 EDMONTON, AB Delivered to community mailbox, parcel locker or apt./condo mailbox. Checked my mailbox at 15:00 and the item was NOT delivered.

Canada Post's error but they tell me I have to contact my vendor to launch an investigation.

This isn't the first time that an error has occurred."
"I totally agree with everyone's opinion of our postal system. It is absolutely appalling. Twice I have had Xmas cards with cash ( I know, don't send cash) disappear. Is all their staff just released from prison?
My daughter sent me a large valuable parcel from BC. She tracked the parcel and was told it was delivered to here me in Que. Relieved that the package had arrived, she threw away her slip with the tracking number. After she asked if I liked what she sent I had to tell her that I never got it. I tried to track it to no avail as we now had no tracking number. I phone the CP complaint dept. and was told, no number, no parcel. I said it has two address on it, can't you deliver it to just one? Mine or hers? Nope. I asked to speak to the worker's supervisor, ""What for? he says. ""About the missing parcel! What do you think you xxxxxx! Who do I speak to?""
""That would be me "" he says. ""What is your complaint/""
It was like a scene out of Monty Python. The parcel finally showed up two months later back at my daughters with ""Return to Sender "" and my correct address written on it.
Now this week they have lost another package.
What are we to do?"
extremely slow processing of shipments from outside Canada. Even slower responding to enquiries. This is worse than a third world country. We stopped shipping to Canada altogether.
"This is complete nonsense....

I've been shipping gifts out to the states to my girlfriend as I'm in a long distance relationship and each time my package gets sent right back when the address is correct. The staff at the post office check adressss to make sure they are correct and accurate. So why does this situation always accur ?.... this is hundreds of dollars I lost I am completely fusterated with the service that gets done here.
-
I am thinking about bringing this to court I will not accept such bad service on my hard earned money. I am a 19 year old young male. Please fix this situation as I am not the only one this happens to. Canada Post office is on there last stand right now you should be trying you're very best to better the service and quality of shipments being sent out. I should not have to ship a gift and it gets to someone in 24 days or not all and gets sent back to me. that's not right when I pay for Express shipping."
"My motorcycle helmet left Fortnine and I was wondering when it would arrive. As I've been home since 5pm, curiosity set at 10pm as I looked to check out the progress of my item.

It turns out that my item did arrive however, the Canada Post delivery truck drivers left their notice in my mailbox instead of knocking on the door or ringing the door bell. It takes 2 seconds to do both and more than 10 seconds to write up the delivery notice letter.

I'm not sure why Fort Nine still uses Canada Post as this isn't the first time such a thing has happened when delivering my products. I'd rather pay the additional fees and use UPS as opposed to supporting CP if their drivers are unable to do such a simple task as ringing a doorbell or knock."
"Package delivery man looked lackadaisical and had the worst attitude I have ever seen. He was extremely rude and he couldn't even provide a simple answer for a question I had asked him about my package. Furthermore, he attempted to STARE me down like he was about to BEAT me up. I have never felt so threatened before and I cannot imagine how other people would have felt if they were in the same situation. The way this man behaved is unacceptable and he should not be working at Canada post because he is a danger to other customers."
They have never ever delivered a parcel to me! I always have to go pick it up every single time! Why are we over paying for delivery if we have to pick it up ourselves?
Delivered my package to the wrong apartment. In turn I received their package. Raised a complaint. They took 3 days to tell me that they did an investigation and did not make an error. I told them the situation. Not even an apology. Used the excuse that we are all human. Refused to speak English to me.
Horrible service....Can't track my educational document within the city in 8 days. Still waiting no response from post Canada. Now manager told me is there any way you can make your document again. Seriously :(
"Canada Post: The dumbest people you've never met. Parcels always saying delivered when they are not, or misdelivered and tell me sometimes the mail just disappears."
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Totally unreliable. I've had muiltiple experiences where Priority and Xpress post deliveries never arrive on time. It's even harder trying to get any help or support from their employees... something you would expect when paying for Priority service."
"To be brief, Canada Post lost my passport.
They ""accidentally"" shipped it back to the sender and deemed it DELIVERED. The sender then sent it back to Canada Post, who then lost track of it in their shipping facility in Richmond. Now because they decided it was DELIVERED, it is untrackable and it is in limbo somewhere in the Richmond facility. Customer Service has been ""on it"" since July 21 (now July 26), but hasn't actually told anyone to get off their behind and find it, or had anyone IN the Richmond facility go and physically look for it.
Good thing I had JUST been issued a work visa, and leave for my overseas contract next week. The cost to replace my brand new passport and work visa (including a stay in Vancouver, as I do not live in the area) is approximately $2000+. Thanks Canada Post.
If I could give negative stars I would."
"I hate this company, their customer support is literally useless. All they do is read off of a screen of info you already know. They cant do anything. Literally never ordering with these morons again"
"I would leave no star if possible, Canada Post 's service is extremely bad. I shipped packets for more than 10 times by their economic shipping options and even higher, but non of them were successfully delivered to the receivers, they just don't deliver and keep goods for themselves. Can you believe that? but it is the truth, non of the receiver got their parcels!"
I was not impressed with their customer service. I received a Delivery Notice and noticed the pick up location was more than 30 blocks from my house when there is a Canada Post location around the block from me. I called to see if they can rerouted and they told me that they cannot. This is ridiculous. Why would they drop off my package 30 blocks from my house when there is one 2 blocks down the road?? This makes absolutely no sense. If this was Fedex or Purolator they would have accommodated and apologized for the inconvenience.
"I had againg find my packe inside the post box which i could not take out because the mindless post man pushed it in by force and closed the box.
I think if these people had a brain they would be very dangerous."
"id give -stars if possible! What a terrible service. ""We cant help you"" is their moto. Post office workers put a Canada post tshirt on and do transactions thats about it. Money wasted and packages lost and all they say is ""yaaaa we're sorry about that."" How can I apply for a job? I want to be paid to sit on my behind all day!"
"Parcels are never delivered to my apartment, though FedEX and UPS both deliver to my unit door. Sometimes a ticket with where and when to pick up is placed in my mailbox, sometimes it isn't. Items are rarely available within 2 days of the expected delivery date. Worst off is they don't even try to contact me if a parcel is being delivered. There is a buzzer for them to contact me, they don't even need to go into the building! Terrible service."
"Horrible Experience.

I have recently had a run in with Canada Post. I ordered a package from Sport Chek for my son (a pair of sandals) over a MONTH ago now and STILL have not received it. I had a change in address back in April that was done INCORRECTLY by Canada Post. Instead of putting my apartment number down, they put a Townhouse number down. Ever since, I have not received any mail to my mailbox. I called them to see what was going on with my parcel and they ADMITTED to making an error in my address. The parcel was delivered IN ERROR to the wrong address which was CONFIRMED by Canada Post. Long story short, they told me that the issue is CLOSED on their end because the parcel was accepted. IT WAS THE WRONG PEOPLE. This is a TOTALLY unacceptable response from Canada Post. They need to be held accountable for messing up my address. I plan on escalating this matter to the highest possible person at Canada Post in hopes of something being done.

Sincerely one very upset customer!!"
"It took 5 days for the package to travel from Germany to Canada but after additional 6 days in Canada tracking still says processing! Terrible ..
Edit: I got the package mentioned above after being hold on Canada for 16 days!!!!!!! No custom labels or checks or anything, just being stored somewhere and not processed.
Now out of 6 packages in the past 2 months NONE of them can be tracked in Canada. This got sooooo frustrating that I'm honestly wish they shut this effing company down for good. Waiting 1-2 months on letters, very small packages that seem to arrive to Canada in up to 7 days and not to be traced in Canada for a month+, I'm still waiting. This is not a single occurrence, this is how pathetic this company operates in this country. Terrible service, arrogant staff, company that charges sooo much for service that is slower than in 3rd world countries (no offence intended to 3rd w.c.)"
"Worst of the worst! i cannot believe that I pay 35$ for xpresspost and this small package did not arrive after 2 days! Seriously, from Mississauga to Calgary, cost of 35$ and takes more than 3 days!"
"Effin tracking is straight trash, didn't update for like past three days,. Also it took them more than 4 days just to deliver something from Montreal to Winnipeg, but the thing is it's not just ordinary package, it's a freaking priority parcel. Either the driver's brain dead or else there's no way I could understand why it took them four effin days to deliver a priority parcel, great job Canada post you nailed it."
"My parcel was sent to Regina instead to my address in Saskatoon. After spending 12 minutes waiting for the agent to pick up the phone I finally told her my problem, she put me on hold again and after waiting for another 7 minutes she hang up on me !!! I googled the Post office in Regina on Broad street and called there directly. The guy there tracked my parcel and told me that it is available for me to pick up in Regina instead in Saskatoon!! I told him that the item was delivered to the wrong city and in fact after he checked the address it said Saskatoon. He told me that he will send it to Saskatoon tomorrow. I tried to ask if I will be able to track the parcel but he told me: ""You are talking too much. I told you I will send it.""!!!! What should I say? I have never experienced such a rude customer service in my life! It happened on July 11, 2017! Canada Post- it's time to make changes!!!"
"Xpresspost... guaranteed to delivery bull... I love it when they take your money and guarantee it but then you read the fine print that says maybe certain conditions apply. I'm expecting a package that they say will be here Wednesday I am willing to bet that this will not happen just form past experiences anyway fingers crossed.
They recently spent millions of supposed dollars to research the best place to put mail boxes due to the stopping of door-to-door delivery.
They place my mailbox 10 ft away from the bus stop with the sign right above it that says no parking within 15 m??
Who did this research kindergarten kids now all the sudden the government wants to cancel this ....the f#@k?
Who pocketed this money the research money AKA tax money.
Doesn't really matter nothing's going to get done about it... whatever

"I ship hundreds of packages every month and this time I had to use Canada Post EST. OMG, it is HORRIBLE. Who designed this thing? A 12 year old? The titles, explanations, sequence of command, none of it making sense or works the way it is supposed to. smh"
"shopping online is utterly hopeless if you happen to live in canada. impossible to track packages with anything other than the stringent tracking number system devised by canada post. a package delivered to vancouver on June 7, still has not arrived in calgary, three weeks later. even if customs were to examine the package carefully, i believe that wouln't take the entire agency more than one entire day. how can canada post justify their existence when we, as captive customers, not only pay dearly to use this government agency, but we are without recourse regarding standard mail service. we pay the highest postal; rates on the planet and we have the absolute worst service."
"I was supposed to receive a package today, so i waited all day for it. And when I checked online, it says you guys missed me when im literally home waiting for my package. Your delivery guys are fuuckin lazy to just knock on the door and give me my mail. What a stupid company with stupid workers. Also, there's no parcel or anything for me to locate my item. The stupid delivery guy didn't even leave any paper or anything. SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO NOW?!?!! Thank you so much for this inconvinience."
"Twice now my carrier put a prefilled out delivery notice in my mailbox, which is 7 feet away from my front door and refuses to deliver my packages. I went to the post office in Harrow to pick up my package and to complain about the lack of service and was told by a worker there that unless a signature is required, they don't have to deliver it. So why am I paying absurd shipping charges ???? Not to mention she never puts the flag up on my mailbox when I have mail, but does so for the neighbour whose mailbox is literally next to mine."
If I could give zero reviews I would. I was in the line for 45 min to pick up a package. One person was there to accommodate 45 people. It is outrageous.
"Canada Post is extremely slow. It seems to me that most of their staffs take a ""none of my business"" approach. Sometimes, their employees don't even know their own rules and regulations."
"let me start by saying i wish i can rate them 0 because the service is really poor. What a horrible experience! I recently shipped an item through Canada post to USA and i paid for express delivery.only for the receiver to get the package and notice is was resealed , he took pictures as proof before he opened it and to his surprise they took the phone and the accessories .canada post as for prove to know it was new true which i sent to them the receipt to show how much the phone's worth,the pictures of the way the package was and the receipt of the package i sent. canada post charge me $40 to send the package and when they got back to me they knew the fault was from them and they offered me $100(rubbish) The phone is samsung S7 edge plus the charge all cost $600 i really don't get what the $100 is going to do(long hiss)when the fault is from them. run run run as fast as you can if you love your self."
Canada post is a joke my package got in Calgary at 7:09 this morning and now there say it won't be here to Tuesday.for a business that was cry ten year ago that they were going broke because of people were send email in stead of letter. In that ten year Canada post has not Change anything. They sit on there butt take there sweet time get your your pack them they cry that there going broke get up off your butt and made work weekend the government should stop give money to them and let them go broke and maybe when they don't have a job sit at home. Then work hard and maybe work weekend won't be so bad.
"Was told the file would arrive the next day at noon, but it's been over a week!!! This made me lost confidence in this company so no more working with Canada post. Was told it takes 5 days to investigate. Oh so I Paid for express just to take over half a month to know where it is, not even know whether it's arrived yet? I'm really disappointed and worried cuz it's a personal file!!! See you forever!!"
"Truly the worst delivery company I have ever dealt with, I order things online like most people and I dread having to ever have Canada Post deliver them, I will take UPS, Purolator, FedEx, anything over this, they don't deliver the package to my door. They drop off all my shipments to one of those awful boxes that they put everywhere because they were too lazy to do the one job they had. Not only this but everytime I go to pick up my package from those damn boxes they have a delivery notice in there for NO REASON, they can never tell me why, so everytime I go half way in in town to pick up my package they say ""oh you must not have been home"" which makes NO sense because they never deliver it to my house because they are too damn LAZY, also THERE IS ALWAYS PEOPLE HOME, you people LITERALLY have one job, pick up a package and deliver it to an address, AND YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT!!! why is no one fixing this terrible trash organization? Canada Post you have a rating of 0.7 out of 10 with 163 reviews RIGHT NOW as I write this, HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE? the lowest you can be rated is one star! you should all be ashamed of yourselves, you are the worst at what you do, THE WROST."
"Canada Post has never delivered a package to my home. Not once. Even when I make it a point to be home they simply leave a delivery notice, and then you have to wait another 24 hours before you can pick the package up from the kiosk. What a colossal waist of my time and backwards service.
Do yourself a favour and avoid the frustration by going with any other service."
"Canada post, in conjunction with Canada Customs, is a broken, dysfunctional organization that seems incapable of reform and therefore needs to be cancelled (a stamp term) and replaced with an entirely new system.
You would think e-commerce would be their savior, but their rotten corporate culture and bureaucracy prevents them from grasping this opportunity. I collect coins and deal with postal offices all over the world, and Canada Post is at, or near the bottom, in inefficiency, compounded and complicated by Canada Custom's Byzantine protocols. Canada Post is emblematic of Canada's corporate/political culture-- mostly incompetent, somewhat corrupt. Sigh!"
"What a horrible experience! I recently shipped an item through Canada post to go to Vancouver which isn't very far from where I sent it. Only 1-2 day shipping. The correct address was placed on the package, but for some reason whoever was delivering the item took it somewhere else. Now an investigation has been launched, but now because of someone else stupid mistake, and not paying attention, I may not only get the item back, neither will the person who bought it, but I will only recieve payment for the shipping. Thanks Canada post, for losing my item, not only may I out money, but now lost a pair of shoes. Thanks! I hope whoever you gave them to enjoys them! Will never ship through this service again."
"I've had so many problems with Canada Post, I can't possibly detail them all. Horrible experience for the last 20 years. Infuriating set-up and customer ""support"". AVOID."
"gave one star only because there wasn't any option to do anything lesser than that.
Lost kids' christmas gifts( issue never resolved). If you were to call the CSR they say they can open a case that's about it. What is the point of opening a ticket number if you are not going to resolve it.
Two weeks ago kids' cloths I oldered were apperantly delivered to community mail box. But there was nothing there. I'm sure it was delivered, but not to my address. I called them they created a ""ticket number"" later that day I get an email saying they are closing because their system shows it was delivered. I'm sure it was delieved but NOT to my address. Either mail carriers are stealing or they are morons who cannot read."
"After reading the comments I'm glad I'm not alone. I thought I was being singled out my my postal carrier. Packages routinely take 3 months or more to get to Sudbury On. At first was quick until mid last year. some items get here early but most take forever and most I pay shipping on. They go on strike every time they can wanting more money but they don't even do their job properly.

They are supposed to deliver packages to your door. NOT ONCE has he done that unless needing signature. I am at home every day as I work from home and think its ridiculous he will take the time to fold my package in half and stuff into box but wont knock on my door for 2 seconds. He left a really expensive pair of dress shoes just hanging off the hooks under my mailbox. Left a violin bow (2.5 feet long) hanging out of mail box. People walk threw my side yard to go threw to back street and mailbox is right there so they can grab a package on way. I have to be vigilant in watching mailman deliver for 2 months in order to make sure I get my stuff. I think I'm going to start my own postal carrier biz lol."
"To begin this sentiment I will start off by mentioning that I have been using Canada Post's services regularly for *roughly* the last 5+ years. While they have always suffered from some sort of faulty service, ie: slow-ish delivery, they nonetheless usually have my packages within 3 - 4 weeks, if not sooner. However, as of the last few months, they seem to have taken a kamikaze nosedive into the pits of hell... and by that I mean their deliveries have hit a new rock-bottom unimaginable to anyone residing within a first world country. Forgive me, as I am not up to date with all of the politics and bureaucracies of this waning pathetic company, but to be quite frank - I don't care. Stories have circulated about wages cut, job losses and the severance of benefits for their employees... but is this anything new? Hasn't this sort of nature been prominent in the organization for like years now? Well that is their problem, not the rest of Canada's. Yet, it has become OUR problem - the people's.
So currently I have three parcels long overdue. Two of which are just CDs, another of which is a $130 + hardcover book. All have been in transit for over a month and a half now (one bordering two months). It would appear to me, based off of private conversations with sellers/companies and the various reviews and anecdotes floating around google that these half-wits now take a minimum of roughly two months delivery, on average. To top the icing on this rotten cake, I have had sellers inform me that Canada Post is (in their opinion) the worst service in the WORLD for whom they deliver to. ONE WOULD THINK WE WERE A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY AT THIS RATE. Perhaps I should just take a trip to Syria or South Africa, temporarily take up residence there and sit back as I await my shipment with superior celerity to that of a supposed ""great nation"" like Canada, no?

Thanks Trudeau and Chopra, you inisidiously verminized SCUM. Yes, ""verminized"" can be a new word just for the likes of slime like you. Wherever my next vote goes, it certainly won't land within eons' length of this Liberal government."
"I often buy music CD's online. I've had a history of decent service from the Canada Post, with the exception of one or two mis-delivered events (ends up on the other side of the street, or I get a neighbour's mail) and have been generally pleased with their service and being understanding of certain long distance international parcels taking some time quite naturally and comfortably.

However, recent months long wait for a parcel in which I paid for tracking (a service which Canada Post don't seem to provide) in which the Canada Post provide a estimate window of delivery WAY off-base, has me scratching my head.

Here's the time frame: Order May 21, Mailed on May 24, Canada Post Tracking Date ""Received"" is May 27. It is now June 19 with the statement that it is still in a ""Customs Review"" at the border. Now I understand that is a Border Issue at this point and not exactly the fault of Canada Post, but then:

To add even more insult to the discomfort, an official statement from the Canada Post assures us that ""we get what we pay for"" and it's just ""what to expect"" when we are being cheap and ordering ""free shipping from China"". Once again, parcel I ordered was paid in full for tracking and shipped from the U.S. I am a little wary to call their customer support with the feeling I'll be getting a similar attitude (you are cheap and have no right to complain about free shipping taking 2 months) even though that is not the case.

Lots of combined issues leading up to my statement here, and I would have sent it to the company themselves if they had a support line I could email instead of being forced to make a phone call or mail a handwritten letter to them.

Conclusion: Things usually run smoothly but something got messed up a few months back and the response from the company is that we are all cheap and to blame China."
"I ordered 3 dvds from Halifax Nova Scotia Canada and I live in Abbotsford British Columbia Canada. The first two I ordered did not arrive and the third one did. I ordered them on May 23rd, 24th and 25th it is now June 16th and I still have not received them, I am not sure if someone is stealing my dvds or if you guys just have poor mail service. I have had no problems until this. I cost a seller his money and dvd's and he told me not to buy off of them cause it was costing him money."
"Package was delivered under priority shipping was supposed to arrive next day. Notice changed to the day after and then the day after that, It's not been two days and I am leaving on a 2 week excursion tomorrow morning and rely on the package. (There's a reason I paid for Priority).

I called three times.

First call was picked up by Brendan who blatantly lied to me and said that it was scanned in Toronto and out for delivery. When I called a second time (10 mins after) I was greeted by Susan who said I had to launch an investigation and have the sender call Canada Post. Unfortunately the send is 3 hours behind and I need the package tomorrow. So I called a third time and they finally launched an investigation, I just had to verify my home shipping details (as the receiver).

There is still no guarantee that I will receive my package, and it will be useless to me if I don't receive it before my trip.

Thanks Canada Post."
"I ordered 2 Packages within a week they both were set to Arrive in the same week and when they did what a nightmare it was The first packadge was Marked on the Truck at 8am then 5 Minutes later it was marked Delivered and I did not see it in my Mail Box till after 11:30am that day... over 4.5 Hours later... Don't mark it delivered if it's not Delivered!!!

Second Package Was marked on the Truck at 8am then I never saw it that day!!! The next day it was Marked Delivered and I didn't see it for over a WEEK!!! After about 15 Call ins and Emails and Messaging Cantacting the Seller and eBay about it I finally got it out of nowhere...

I want it to be known I Voted for Stephen Harper and I had no problem with Mail Carriers loosing their jobs, In fact if it ever happens again I hope they do cause the Private Sector would do a much better job then the Government Companny!!!"
"Worse than African Island Nations' Postal Service
Canada post is beyond useless, they are an incompetent greedy bureaucratic mess. Even though they have tracking for international packages, they don't share the information, not by internet, not by twitter, not buy facebook, e-mail or even phone. We send packages to Canada, and pay for 10 day registered post, average delivery time is 8 weeks now, with no tracking.
Worst in the world, we should know, we ship everywhere. I am not exaggerating."
"On May 3rd, 2017 I sent an envelope via Priority Worldwide, which guaranteed the package to be delivered by May 4th. My shipment was sent from Winnipeg to arrive to a post office box in Pine Creek, MN. I paid over $50.00 to have this shipment sent to arrive on time, And I provided all of the information to the girl on staff. I was reassured that if the package did not arrive on time that I could request a refund with no questions asked. I was provided a tracking number and sent on my merry way. So May 5th rolls around and check the tracking number only to find that my package was held up in customs. I call Canada Post, who then transfers me to Canada Customs who tells me that my package is held up because it does not say on the way bill what is inside. Canada Customs takes my information that it is just a letter and clears the package. The next day I check the status of the package, and I see that it is now being held by Fed Ex for an incomplete address. So I phone Canada Post again, who then transfers me to Fed Ex who informs me that I needed a physical address to sent the letter. This is information that would have been helpful to know when I was shipping the package as I would have happily provided this information. No one made me aware that I required it. Fast forward to May 9th, when my package is finally delivered. I contact the Canada Post office where I sent the package from and I am told that they cannot do anything at their office and all requests for refunds need to go through Canada Post. They kindly provide me with a toll free number to call. So I call 1-800-267-1177 and request my refund. I am told that the refund is approved and to expect it within 8-10 business days, and the caller provides me with a reference number. On May 26th, (14 days later) no refund had come. I call Canada Post again, provide them with the reference number and inquire on the status of my refund. To which I am told that they don't have any record of a refund request and that they will have to process a refund request that day, and again in 8-10 business days I should get my refund. At this point I request to speak to a supervisor, but I am told that there is no supervisor and that if there was nothing else they can help me with to have a nice day. So I wait another 10 business days in the hopes that my refund will arrive. Not surprisingly I have still not received my refund. So I call Canada Post again....and I am told that the last two representatives did not follow proper procedure and I have to be transferred to a special team that can take my refund request. So I wait on hold for 10 minutes, and when I finally get through to someone and tell them the entire situation I am advised that I made the error in shipping and that my refund request would not be approved. I explained the situation, and my frustration and the clerk agreed to put through a refund request. But it would take...you guessed it another 10-15 business days. I was also advised that if I had taken this up with the manager at the Post Office where I had originally sent the envelope from that they would have issued me a refund. And even when I had explained that I had already done that and was told that was not possible, and when I had asked the clerk why hadn't the previous representatives told me this, I was told that the call center that takes those calls is subcontracted and they are not actually Canada Post employees, and where most likely improperly trained. What could I say to this, other than there are my tax dollars at work....
While I am happy with the service I received from my last call I am terribly annoyed and frustrated that I have had to waste my time and energy to receive a refund. And at this point I have so little faith in Canada Post t. It feels like Canada Post makes receiving a refund so difficult that eventually people give up out of frustration. I will NEVER use Canada Post again to ship this type of envelope."
"I've never had a problem with Canada Post, decided to make this review after seeing all of the negative ones...this is of course because people don't usually praise what is to be expected."
"I've never had any issues with Canada post until the start of this year, and now I've had numerous packages that have been designated ""delivered"" not turn up for weeks after it's been marked ""delivered"". And most recently my international parcel was marked ""delivered"" and dropped off in a different city, not even close to my delivery address..."
"A parcel was shipped using Canada Post International Xpresspost, which has a 6 day delivery guarantee with a refund offered, if the delivery is late. The parcel arrived late, so an application for a refund was made. About 10 days later, a letter was received denying the claim. The letter said ""we have determined that Canada Post service standards were met and that the item was delivered as per the guarantee"". No factual explanation as to why the claim was denied; it appeared to be a standard ""bureaucratic"" form letter.

When first asking Canada Post about the late delivery, the representative agreed the delivery was late and issued a Service Ticket number and said a refund cheque should be sent. Following the letter of decline, a second call was made to ask why the claim couldn't be fulfilled with reference to document from Canada Post showing the destinations and dates; this information clearly showed the parcel was delivered late.

It was disappointing to understand why a Service Ticket was issued in the first place, if Canada Post later said the parcel arrived on schedule.

A lot of disappointment and frustration could be avoided here for both parties, if the Canada Post service guarantees were actually valid and truthful. Why offer a 6 day delivery guarantee, if it can't be honoured?"
I ordered an item from the bay and realized right after i forgot the apt number and tried to contact The Bay and Canada post to let them know and they just both told me they cant change an order and theres nothing they can do about it but wait til after it gets delivered and recall if it doesnt arrive. I did that and then they tell me to wait for a update on my tracking info the following business day that says it will be dropped off at closest office for pick up. I did that and my item was returned to the original shipper. I havent ordered online before but this has made my experience with canada post enough to never receive mail from them if i have the shipment option. extremely terrible service and live chat doesnt know anything about their company.
"I ordered the Iphone 7 Plus on may 31 and was supposed to receive it on thursday june 1st(according to Canada Post), but never got it, and Koodo can't even send another one until 48 hours or more after you alert them about the situation. Called Canada Post service and I was told that the my ticket was prioritized and that the supervisor would call me in MAX 1 DAY, but haven't gotten a single call nor email. If your order says out for shipping for more than 1 day, call right away!!!"
"I emailed Canada Post to inform them that my package has not been received and on their tracking system (the one I was given) shows that the package had not even been attempted to have reached my address, it just says package is being returned to original sender.

Canada post replies that their system shows that a note was left for me where to pick up or that package has either been successfully delivered to me....and then they send me the same tracking link that I have which INDICATES / SHOWS NOTHING from what they just informed me. It's like they didn't even look at the tracking information.

To sum it up, Canada Post basically lied saying that in their system the item had been delivered to me or a note was left at my door....which is UNTRUE based on the tracking number/system that I was sent by Canada Post THEMSELVES.

WOW TERRIBLE. I hope they go out of business. I seriously hope Canada Post just shuts down. If that happens I would gladly drive over to the USA and pick up my items there through my US mailbox, way cheaper, with way less hassle."
"Received a parcel COD. for Customs. According to Company was no duties to be paid? When questioning Norm Fatima's staffing boss he explained some parcels picked indiscriminately for this?? Not so according to Customs. Package came so damaged in a bag. Laurie at Depot Number 2
told mail person to deliver it as is? Took two extra weeks because Laurie and Jill who said they were Superintendents not! stated it was locked in cupboard no key or sitting in Vancouver. No-one in depot 2 could give a proper answer . Mr. Wyatt who was supposed to call could not take the time. Instead Braden another supervisor called and said ""I will tell Laurie and Jill to quit telling people stories about their parcels Phone number depot to actually get superintendent 780-944-3402. Ext.4 Ask for Mr. Wyatt . Customer Service contracted out no help there. And still waiting call from Ombudsman who is supposed to call within 48 hrs. Not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I usually get my packages within the timeframe provided, however, they ALWAYS ignore the sign on my door that my baby is sleeping and to knock lightly. Instead they ring my doorbell and wake the baby!!!"
real bad..lost my package again..i bet mexico have better mail services
"Canada Post has banned me from their FBpage for telling the truth about their new stamp commemorating the Muslim Festival Eid...
I live on a farm where we grown our own animals and I hunt but this festival is just a bloody massacre that Canada shouldn't endorse!!"
"I was waiting for my package and decided to check the tracking number when it did not arrive. I live in an apartment so the notice of attempted delivery is always left on my door or in my mailbox. There was no notice of delivery left re: this package. When I went to my local Canada Post, they said that they did not receive it there, that it was at another location - not even in my area. I don't have a car (hence, why I ordered online to begin with). I called the location where they are holding my package and asked why a attempted delivery notice was not left at my home and the girl on the phone said, ""Sometimes, they forget to leave a notice."" So, how would I know my package was there in the first place if they didn't leave a notice? I thanked her for her superb customer service (there was nothing she could do). I hung up and called the Canada Post Support phone line and told the rep my situation. He said that the package would not be re-attempted to be delivered, although they could check if package could be delivered to my local post office (it could not be). He offered to give me the notice of attempted delivery # because without it, I could not go pick up the package. That's pretty convenient when they ""sometimes forget"" to leave the notice. The customer service from Canada Post was no help."
"I had an expresspost package that was claimed to have been delivered however was not. Apparently they can scan the parcel anytime and anywhere after they leave the post office and then mark it as delivered. Canada Post then justified this by saying if you had an envelope purchased from them, they could track to exactly where the deliverer was when scanning and otherwise they can and do scan in their vehicle before leaving the post office or anywhere in between. I have two witnesses, the secretaries at my office, both stating he did not deliver the package but Canada Post says because he scanned it, it was delivered. I am being left hanging with their resolution of delivered and no responsibility being taken by the postal service for the loss of my $400+ item. Talk about a lousy, expensive and irresponsible service!!"
I was supposed to have gotten a package on Thursday. The guy barely rang the doorbell and his left a freaking notice. I was home THE ENTIRE TIME FFS. And now they want me to wait. I go at Friday later than when they said to come and they told me they will have the package in the after noon. Was working that day so i went on Saturday and they told me to wait until Monday. Now it's Monday and they want me to wait till Tuesday. This is completely unacceptable. My package was expensive and is very weak to temperatures. There is rly no excuse for this type of thing and they didnt even give me an apology. Canada post has the absolute worst service I have ever experienced. This has totally ruined my perspective on The Canada post services. The employee was giving me nothing but lies. The distribution service is RIGHT outside my house too. Like rly. Really.......... just the worst experience and infuriating.
"The only reason why there's one star is because I can't give zero. The woman I just spoke to had a terrible attitude for one and she said the reason I won't be getting my package this week is because it says apt 11 as opposed to apt 1, which doesn't matter because it's residential so the package would come to the same door regardless. My address and house number was all correct, just not the apartment number... Now my friend won't be getting a birthday present on her birthday! Thanks Canada Post! Hire better employees with more competency!"
"I can see that my situation is not unique, which makes me feel bad, because I didn't verify before my mail was sent and I trusted a company, which proved to be a wrong choice.

My parents sent me an envelope with an official document in order to be admitted at UBC. The envelope left from Europe on May 03rd and arrived in Canada on May 11th, according to Canada Post office where I verified and by May 25th, nobody knows where is the envelope. I talked to 5 different clerks in different post offices plus 5 people at customer service, trying to find out the situation of my document. I have to say that I experienced the fastest customer service possible: about 30 seconds with 2 answers: check on-line or because is an international mail, Canada Post is INCAPABLE to track an envelope which is in their yard and I have to verify with the sender (considering that the envelope arrived in Canada and was processed by Canada Post). I requested to be helped by a supervisor or manager, which can track more easier an envelope, but no one was available for about 3 or 4 days, when I decided to get my document with FedEx. A manager or a supervisor could have solve the problem in a few minutes, but actually this is the importance that they offer to their customers, this is how valuable are the people who pays them, which is ZERO.

On a nutshell: if you have to send something DO NOT USE Canada Post. If there are no others options buy a pigeon, train him and your mail will have more chances to get in time and more safely."
"A complete disgrace to postal services in general and total disregard. All they want is money money money when they xannot provide proper service as it stands.

Why should we give them money and pay for a service that they provide as less then sub par. We should not give them a cent until they fix the broken system as it stands today, we should use electronics to do more of our postal duties when possi le to make them lose even more money and use a non Canada Post owned courier service when needed. Yes courier is costly but at end of day less money we give Canada Post better off we are."
"4 of the last 5 times my xpresspost was late. The most incompetent company in the country, and they run all of our mail service. I swear to God I cannot wait until the day a competitor is on the rise and pushes CP aside with actual good business practices. I f3cking hate Canada post and all of their spoiled idiotic staff"
"I was expecting my package on Friday before the long weekend. And I was waiting in my house for the delivery. After a while I checked the door to find a slip on my door, which meant I had to go pick up the package myself on the next business day which was 3 days from Friday. I swear I did not hear the mailman ring the doorbell. He's just got trying to pull a fast one."
"Weekend ruined because some lazy (and probably fat) a33hole decided he didn't want to get out of the truck and deliver my 'signature requested' package. It was guaranteed for friday, and now i have to wait until monday for my package (i had plans this weekend). I've always hated Canada post, and i know that will never change."
"It fricken takes for EVER for a shipment to arrive once Canada post has your package in hand. I've received six packages now in April and May that should have arrived last year no later than November 15. According to the tracking number, all those packages were in Canada withing six days of ordering them. And still see it now, when I order something it takes about six days then its here in Canada, and then it takes like 40 days for it to finally arrive at my house."
"They never attempted delivery and now I have to pick up what a scam, they charge for a service they don't provided"
"Roughly 80% of my online purchases are done at Amazon, who don't use Canada Post as a delivery option. Recently, I purchased some Lego minifig's from a site similar to eBay, but Lego only. My seller has been amazing with communication over this sub-par Canada Post experience we have shared. The shipping method used was Expedited Parcel, going from Ontario to Alberta.

I have never been a fan of Canada Post, because I haven't heard nothing too overly positive about their delivery system. It is great they give house owners mailboxes, but as an apartment resident I don't see the benefits.

Anyways, my problem began this past weekend (May 13, 2017) when shortly after I received the tracking link from my seller, it read:

2017/05/13, 11:25, ON Recipient not located at address provided. Item being returned to sender.
2017/05/13, 11:25, ON Item has been returned and is enroute to the Sender.

Apparently Canada Post tells me where I live... I contacted Customer Support by phone, which I found rather tedious to locate on Canada Post's website. The support representative I had could not tell me what the issue was other than ""my supervisor isn't in until Monday, you will have to call back then"". I asked for the call reference number and she seemed rather deflated about providing it. I wanted it for when things didn't go right I could provide my experience in full.

From my call I concluded the following:
After you provide a tracking number the representative does not have information beyond the same webpage that you look at after typing your tracking number into Canada Post's tracking webpage. It seems as if they are just guessing as to what could have happened, rather than seeing what actually happened. Support should have full information.

My seller opened a support ticket with Canada Post and on May 15th at 01:22 in ON, the item was processed. Although, the problems did not end here. Today, May 17 the following in the tracking system came up:

2017/05/17 06:23, AB Item processed.

2017/05/17 08:04, AB Item processed.

2017/05/17 09:12, AB The item being returned to the sender went out for delivery.

2017/05/17 09:12, AB Return to sender attempted. Card left indicating where item can be picked up.

2017/05/17 12:04, AB Return to sender attempted. Card left indicating where item can be picked up.

At 9:30 this morning I took garbage down the chute room and there was no ""Card left indicating where item can be picked up"", because the delivery driver HAD NOT SHOWN UP until 11:56 am when he rung my apartment. However, when the delivery driver showed up he said that he could not hand over my package because:
""it's really messed up, it's already been put into the system as missed delivery and will be waiting at the nearest post office. Let me see if I can give the package to you and update the system. ... Nope. Okay I have to take it to the Post Office or it goes in the system as 'Undelivered' and becomes a headache."" - Delivery driver who honestly seemed to be the only Canada Post employee to care.

I decided to call the Support line again today, just to inquire about why that would have happened. My representative provided me information I could see on the Track Your Package webpage. She also kept trying to suggest that my sender could have selected an option where the package was to be delivered to the nearest post office and not my door. However, again she did not have concrete evidence as to whether my sender selected that option or not. She did however say that my local post office could inform me whether or not my sender chose the option to send the package to my apartment or to the post office. This deeply bothers me that the Post Office has the information, but Support does not!?!?!

Canada Post needs to start providing their Support Staff with access to information to factually answer questions and not make assumptions. Luckily they have made a typical ""support maze"" on their website, so people get frustrated and either not dig deeper for a phone number or not do anything about it. When shipping with other companies, I pay a premium for better service to avoid problems, not fund them.

10/10 Unsatisfied. Happy I paid for tracking, so I could experience Canada Post in the same light as the rest of these reviews.

"Wish I could rate them zero stars. I've made probably 8 orders in the past 6 months and only one time did they actually attempt to buzz my apartment without just putting the notice in my mailbox. The delivery woman was super rude and complained about me living in an apartment. The other 7 orders I was home for and no one even tried buzzing so I had to go pick them up (late) the next day. Rediculous, and Canada Post thinks they should be paid more????"
"every single time we order anything from Canada Post its always 2-3 days late, the last 3 packages we ordered were all 1 day shipping priority and it doesnt come till 3 days later. Meanwhile i see my neighbours getting their mail and i'm just sitting her confused as hell, do they even check things out? do their workers even know what priority means?? For such a great country why do we have to have such a crappy postal service lol"
"Can't trust a simple birthday card to get anywhere. About a year ago they stole 40 cash from a birthday card I send. When I told them about this they said it was considered money laundering and it was illegal. I really don't like arguing so I laughed and said ok. A year later another birthday card was send (without money this time) they opened it to check for money, didn't find it sealed it back up and send it"
"My international EMS parcel has been sitting with Canada Post since 5 days. ""Item was released by Customs and is now with Canada Post for processing"" as per their website. I called them and they don't know where it's now. They said investigation should be initiated from the originating country. Their customer service agents are there to tell you that they know nothing about your item, and that you can do nothing!
I don't understand what they can do in the originating country if the item is with Canada Post!"
The most incompetent organization in the world. CEO and all managers should be fired. Hate crown corporations. Completely useless.
I buy most my items online. Like clock work Canada post screws something up with every delivery. Then they make it your fault somehow and refuse to give any help whatsoever. Why do i pay for fast shipping if my packages are 2-3 days late when i pay for 1 day shipping? What is the point of your tracking numbers if they are not accurate? Just the other night i got a notification that my package has arrived and i go to pick it up at a branch and the worker there tells me after waiting in line for 20min that its not there. I said i got a notification and she tells me that its in the back shes just too busy to process it. I told her i can see the package right behind her (it was quite large with amazon tape) and she said im too busy. I told her i need this for my work can she just get it please i waited like everyone else. She just brushed me off and started helping the next person. I will only use CP if its my last resort. I don't have these problems with other carriers.
"My international package was sent to France on December 3rd, 2016 for 93,77 $ with an approximative time of 2 months to arrive there.

I called Canada Post to open an investigation on April 10th, 2017 and they will come back with an answer within the next 10 days. They did not contact me at all. I twitted them on May 1st for complaining via their Social Media and they just told me to call to get more information. I contacted the guest services through the phone on May 3rd, and they still didn't know where was my package and refused to transfer my call for a complain. I called back on May 4th to talk to a supervisor that she called back the next day to tell me that I couldn't get any refund or help until the investigation wasn't close for May 24th because it was open around April 26th.. However, she gave a me a number - 1 800 204 4198 - to call the office and complained about it. Roopesh at the office refused my complain because my investigation will not be closed until July 5th.

I am really wondering now WHERE you get all your WRONG and DIFFERENT information. That's so a bad service, no compassion to their guests, no help, and they even do not know where the package is.. so for what we have a tracking package??

Reference number : 121475031."
"I sent a phone back to ebay seller in US, it was note delivered after over a month, I submitted a ticket with Canada post, even tho I paid for 100$ insurance, they simply dont give a crap and just closed the ticket:

Submitted: 2017/04/18

Despite our continued efforts, we have not yet received a reply from the recipient.

In some circumstances, delivery scans are not available even though items have been delivered. Regrettably, without a confirmation of non-delivery from the recipient, we have no choice but to close the file.

"Extremely rude. My package was sent back to sender and I have no idea why. That was over a month ago. I was told I needed to contact customer service, so I did. Whoever was on the phone raised her voice at me, and I wasn't not being unreasonable or angry. As someone who works in customer service, I know it's upsetting to be yelled at by customers for no good reason, so I always try to be polite. I calmly asked her what could be done about my package and she told me, ""nothing"". Whatever happened to my package probably isn't her fault but Canada Post obviously does not care about their customers if they speak to them like this, without offering any sort of solutions, or at least an apology. Maybe a simple, ""sorry about that""?
Now I have to deal with the Sender's mailing system.
Truly not surprised at all the other negative reviews on here."
"Worst. I keep on ordering stuff from ebay many times a month. It used to arrive in time (20-25 day) about 8 months ago, but ever since about Sept-Nov 2016, parcels takes 3-4 months to arrive. The worst thing is that you keep on re-ordering and also keep on claiming ebay that things have not arrived, and they develop mistrust on you! Every single thing I order takes 3-4 months minimum. I ordered soldering iron on 6th October 2016, and it arrived on 17th April 2017; same for zip-ties, gimbal controller, and still waiting for some gopro mounts, wifi ip camera, and xt-90 battery connector to arrive. Camera ordered on 6th January 2017, mount ordered on 9th January 2017, and connector on 3rd January 2017. I have literally stopped ordering on ebay now due to CANADA POST's WORST-CLASS service. I literally feel sick and ashamed of having Canada post for us! Better to sell it to some private company."
"I ordered some photo equipment from Singapore. The seller sent it through the Postal service as he does for every country. He says everyone gets it in the USA within 10 days. So he thought it would be the same in Canada. He sent it on March 22nd and effectively it arrived in Canada on April 6th. But since then it is stuck ""somewhere"" and has not been delivered to my home as of May 3rd (that is 4 weeks of ""stuck somewhere"". I need this product now so I re-ordered it and asked the provider to use DHL this time. I received my product within 4 days. When I ask at the Post Office about this issue I am told this is very common - it may take up to 2 or 3 months and there is nothing one can do! This is a very poor untrustable service. Too bad."
"from the delivery, or lack thereof, to the customer service resolution specialists, canada post has been one of the worst companies i've ever done business with. all employees i dealt with at every level seemed to dislike their jobs and we're negative from the get-go. i know customer service can be trying, but it doesn't get any easier when your default is to be combative and distrusting of the customer. i will be writing to the merchant from which i placed my order to encourage them to consider a different postal service. delivery person claims no answer when 3 ppl home all day, when calling in to resolve rep is rude, supervisor tells me to call and the number i get is bad and cannot receive calls, i'm told package is in the depot and when i arrive i'm told it will not be ready unt CLOSING the next day despite the delivery notice says it would be ready that day/time. all while i am leaving in oreparing to leave the country in 48 hours for 2 weeks. package was needed for the trip. just dreadful."
"We are somewhat remote by living in Northern Ontario. But we are on the trans Canada 11, so not that much ""out of the way"". With that said we have to pay much more for Express shipping 1-2 days. But it takes a week or more to get package even from Southern Ontario. And it does stupid things while tracking. As it could sit a day or two in Sudbury or Timmins before it makes the final trek sometimes just an hour away to final destination. Just awful all around. Once I finally get a notice that the package is in. I like to do my stuff all in one shot when I am out in the mornings. Well I have to deal with grumpy local staff that give me heck because it is so busy that day. That they did not have time to sort out the notifications cards yet. If I forget a tracking number I get more drama as they are frustrated searching for my package on their computer. I guess costumer service does not exist with these people."
"Only reason I'm giving it one star is beacuse there is no ""zero"" star available. I recently mailed an envelope and I had it delivered back to my address. I had to go into the Post Office to find out what the problem was. The lady was a complete re**rd and told me that because I had crosed out an old address and wrote a new one (reused my envelope) ""the machine"" got confused. She gave me a BS story of how all the mail goes to Montreal and then get sorted by machine and that's what happend. The same post office employes other re**rds who regularly deliver my mail to my neighbours and vice versa in our community mailbox. No wonder they're lossing money and no one uses Canada Post anymore."
"I thought I had found a way to increase my business and keep costs down for my customers by using regular mail for 100 gram and under products. I had put one bubble mailer in the mail to a destination ONE hour from my address, it took 2 months to arrive!!!

Recently I sent 3 mailers all to the same address in Ontario from BC, three weeks later they still have not arrived. Apparently, the mail must be "" held up."" Really? Where? The answer to that is "" You should have sent it registered mail."" No, Canada Post you SHOULD do your job and deliver the mail instead of only delivering mail you charge a ridiculous amount for.

Many customers will now pay inflated costs for something that should arrive in a most cost effective manner. The only service that is somewhat reliable is a parcel and that is because it is expensive."
"I believe in supporting our national organizations; so, when i had to send something across Canada, i turned to Canada Post; after all, they advertised ""priority Post delivery within 1-2 business days, anywhere in Canada"".
Here's what happened:
I sent a document via Priority Post, with a prepaid return envelope on Monday;
sure enough my document arrived at its destination on Wednesday; 2 business days; so far so good;
My document was picked up, via Priority post, prepaid postage, to me on THU; it should have been in my hands on SAT; i thought Canada Post works on SAT; at least the other delivery services do;
Nothing on SAT; but I wasn't worried, i still had Monday as i was leaving for my trip on TUES;
MON came and went; nothing; it was now the 3rd business day that CP had my document; i had to cancel my trip;
It did not arrive til TUES, the 4th business day; too late for my trip;
It would have been cheaper and just as fast, to have used regular mail ( $ 4.50) rather than a $45.00 Priority post Envelope; after all, Canada Post says ""2 days for delivery to/from a major centre"";
I will rebook my trip but, i willl not rely on Canada Post;"
"I was expecting parcels today and have checked the online tracking several times in the morning since it showed ""out for delivery"". When I checked the tracking afternoon, it says ""notice left"". I was home all day but nobody knocked my door. And of course, sadly, this is not the first time that Canada post didn't even come to the door and just left the notice.
Moreover, there was one time when they brought my percel to a different location where was much further and it was hard to go get it with my little one."
Cheques for our business often take weeks to arrive and sometimes don't show up at all. I could walk with the mail quicker. Customers have to cancel and reissue. We are now progressing to electronic and credit card payment systems and are attempting to cut Canada Post out of our business entirely.
"I had never excepted this kind of service. Sometimes you don't know which parcel service will the sender use, so I chose to get them on my work place. the mail carrier just throw the parcels at our door, its so rude, we have front desk and someone is always there, but still just to give it to the person on deck they just through it and this happen all the time, this time my stuff is damaged, and I myself saw that the mail carrier has throw the parcel on floor it get dent on the edge and get away and didn't care like this was not his job he was doing it unwillingly. the noise was so loud as well that people from back office and next door came out to see what just happen.

Even when he deliver regular mails, he is always rough."
"I got the final notice today on 24 th of April, that I can pick up a parcel and it will be held until until 18 th of April, so my mother gonna receive her parcel back(( it's really sad experience as I think if you have some issues notifying customers you need to send at least 2 notices or you can call to the customer.
And what happens now you wasted everybody's time and money. I can't understand, it's just so ridiculous, why the business doesn't use common sense."
"Absolutely horrific experience. I have mail of medical nature that I order through there express post service ( usually 3 days delivery ). When I saw it would take almost double I was confused and decided to call in to inquire about why the service I payed extra for was not being supplied to me. Now, unfortunately, my medicine ( without much detail ) helps me in social situations where without it I may have issues communicating with people well. After calling customer support and stumbling over a couple words and speaking alittle fast she proceeded to laugh at me and continue to laugh as I talked untill I asked her if my illess was funny to her ( was alittle upset with the situation ). Instead of apologising she simple just told me she can't see anything on the computer so there is no reason but I'd need to just accept It while i still herd her snickering ( with someone? ) in the background with a couple comments...I called back and asked very politely if I could speak with a Manger/authority about my experience as I felt it was not ok to be treated the way I was..this is not ok. Not only is it not ok to make fun of or laugh at someone with mental health issues but it's definetly not ok for a government customer service agent to do it. But of course after 40 minuites of waiting while opening a ticket with them Its been 2 days and they still haven't called back.... clearly we are not a priority to them and there is no control over there workers, divisons, or delivery. Guess I'll be waiting for the next celebrity depression suiciDE until mental health is important again .... üòíüòî"
"Poor delivery, only thing I can rely on is on Fridays I never receive ANY mail.
I mail order a fair amount of supplies and packages for work I do, we are across from a complex of about 400 units, divided into 4 sections of about 100 units each. My address is even numbered, the complex has the SAME address, so mine would be 42 theirs is 42-111. That neighbor has brought me more mail than my postal worker. Not Canada Posts issue of poor numbering but read the proper address would be great since we are in community mailboxes now.
I also order overseas (UK and China both) some arrive within a week, others like now I am STILL waiting for products in transit and arrived at CA destination since January. one actually arrived 2 days ago after 93 days in customs for no reason. It is getting ridiculous the way we cannot function in a way to send or receive packages in a reliable way. And since they conveniently removed tracking for packages arriving from outside the country it has become worse. Its almost worth getting a PO box in the US and driving down once a month to receive mail properly, and without being raked over hot coals and robbed to ship things.
You cant file a complaint or issue easily, and heaven forbid you ask for any sort of assistance from a worker behind the desk at a brick and mortar location."
"It's happened to us for several times that the post man did not even knock the door to inform that we have a parcel. They just put a sign and asked us to go to the post office and pick up the parcel!! We have already paid for it! Didn't we!?
Actually, I'm not criticizing all they do for people, but this part is sometimes awful!
Thanks"
"lost my package, they put wrong community mailbox or parcel locker. i try to contact them, they hang out my phone, they told me should go online check, but i go online, still not fixing it, and i think their bad service. Good luck! :)"
I need 0 star! They lost my package from abroad and they were supposed to do a investigation (we went through a proper procedure to submit a request of investigation which I was suggested by Canadapost) but 4 months later I received the answer from the sender that Canada post didn't respond for the time period. I called to complain about it and they didn't even know what was the problem because it was insured and I would get money back for that. The point was they didn't do anything to solve the issue or they would even try to improve the situation. They don't care who lost what and how stressful to go back and forth to talk to the post offices in 2 counters. The person who I talked to was not helpful at all and just hang up on me because there was nothing they could do. Great customer service.
I have packages that come regularly that require my signature. They don't even bother coming to the door they just throw the notice in my mailbox and carry on causing me to wait another day to get my mail. Poor way of doing business if you ask me!
"Honestly Canada post is a huge steaming pile of mismanaged garbage. On multiple xpress packages my packages have gone missing , or subsequently delayed even though It is my medicine. Customer service is actually some of the worst, from people who dont care to people giving false info, the staff literally sound like they want to kill themselves which is great to experience when youre trying to get assistance.

Multiple occasions the drivers have failed to DELIVER my package even though my tracker says delivered, and that Canada post was at my building with my package but did not deliver it for some reason even though each time the delivery info was correct. What do they do once they ""sucessfully delivermy package"" aka dont even attempt to deliver it and ultimately send it back to sender each time, its funny because no other courier has an issue delivering packages but its always Canada Post doing a god awful job at delivering things . I WOULD NEVER TOUCH THIS COMPANY WITH A 10 FOOT POLE If it wasnt for my medicine having them as the only courier to deliver my medicine."
You can't trust them to do what you need. Asked to send papers from Regina to Belleville with in one or two days. Shipped on Apr 12 in the afternoon. Package didn't leave Regina in Apr 17 and will not arrive till Apr 19th. What was the sense in paying all that money for that kind of service. Not going to use them again.
"I shipped out a very expensive package on the 27th of March and on the 31st it said the package was being processed and it is now April 12th and Canada Post has no idea where my package is and one of the customer service agents said the issue would be resolved May 5th! I thought she was kidding, but I guess not. I've literally had to call Canada Post each time and I could tell on the phone speaking with multiple agents that they don't give a crap. I was also forced to pay for shipping although Sony gave me a reference number that voids that and Canada Post couldn't find it in their system. This is the absolute worst experience I've had with Canada Post and now I'm probably out $327.61 thanks to them losing my package. I've been a customer for years, but it looks like this will be the last time I deal with Canada Post."
"I'm a mail order business owner. I use Xpress Post for overseas shipping. The parcels don't get where they're going any faster than using small packet air service. The cost is higher but the service is still poor especially as a 4 day guaranteed service... I mailed a parcel to the UK on 04/07/17 it's now 04/12/17 and all tracking says is that it's in transit. So much for guaranteed delivery in the time frame allotted, which by the way CP switches from 4 days to 4 to 12 days once they have your money.... Isn't bait and switch an illegal practice... ?"
"From lost packages never delivered or delivered at 2am 3 months later, to packages traveling to the other side of the continent away from the addressee, or traveling for weeks to every locale around the delivery address.
A total lack of accountability, complete refusal of customer service (tracking number shows package going the wrong way - customer service refuses to contact the processing center or the truck driver to redirect the package, something commercial shippers do on request) complete refusal to collaborate in lost package investigations, and more.
Every excuse used to do absolutely nothing to satisfy the customers.
Canada Post is worse than even USPS, while taking the tax payers money. The final straw is border processing fees - why then i should use Canada Post?
Time to switch to FedEx, or other commercial shippers. Cheaper shipping, same processing fees, better customer service."
"I sent a request ticket for a replacement mailbox key (near midnight Sunday), then found the key on Monday morning at 7:40am. I called to cancel the request (and avoid charge of $29 + tax?) but the work order has already been processed and they will be coming Thursday to replace the locks and provide me a notice... THURSDAY!!! 3+ Days from now and we cannot cancel the request???

Come on Canada Post, really... and I'm not going to talk about the poor customer service and 30+ minute wait times... very poor performance."
A postal service with cultural and operational defects. First to operational. We sent local mail from Vancouver to Vancouver. It took 18 days. We complained about it. And received a barrage of excuses about how it must be our fault - perhaps we can't write properly etc? Staff should apologize and be embarrassed about their poor quality but they've been trained to fight customers and go home to bury their heads in the sand. Second. 23 had a letter of importance sent by British Royal Mail to us in Calgary. We paid for tracking. The UK postal service took 3 days to get it to Canada (Toronto) which is ok. Canada Post then took 10 days to deliver it to Calgary. Canada Post. You are operationally flawed and have an inability to accept the need to reflect and improve. This is a time at the top issue. They are likely led by a disinterested CEO or an in experienced one. Start by addressing your cultur of client service. And don't hide behind public sector union stuff. Just fix it. Then employ a decent COO. You need operational excellence.
"I don't understand why no one can find my door? I literally stayed awake with minimal volume on my music and had my browser open on the delivery status, all of a sudden the delivery status is on ""notice left"" ?updated not even a minute ago with NO KNOCK WHATSOEVER. I swear they don't even try to go to doors.. once again I have to go to the god damn post office to pick up yet another package, I might as well just erase my address on shipments and put the post offices address since it can never reach mine."
I mailed my scholarship application package on March 17th from Victoria BC to Nanaimo BC (both are on the same island). It is March 30th and the package has still not arrived (thank goodness I checked with the committee to see if it had arrived) and it is due March 31st. When I visited the outlet they said that I just have to wait and see if it arrives. I will now be forced to send it by email after I paid for Canada Posts services and spent a lot of time and money on supplies to print and present my application. My advise is to only mail something with Canada Post if it is your only option.
"on 24th I posted an important package from Montreal to Quebec city with Xpresspost. They charged me $15 to deliver the package in ONE DAY. Today is 28th and the package has not been received yet. Made some phone calls and found out the package is in DIEPPE, NB!!!!! they just keeping apologizing and they insist THEY CAN NOT TELL ME WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO DELIVER THE PACKAGE. Worst quality of the service I have ever seen!"
"The fact that you cannot, at least, add a Suite No or rectify the wrong street or even tweak the address in the slightest where there's a mistake is just...terrible. Happened to me with Purolator and AMZCA and I was able to rectify the issues with the address while the item was still in transit. Called Canada Post twice and they had NO way to rectify this except the item was being returned and all I needed was to provide the Suite No. The least they could ask for was a form of identification to be sure it was a legitimate request for change. For goodness sakes, why???"
"If the driver doesn't feel like being ""active"" on a delivery, the piece of sh!t just drives by and doesn't make any attempt at getting out of the vehicle to actually do the delivery. Instead the douchebag will say they made an attempt at delivery when actually they looked at the 12 steps it takes to get to the door, started sweating, and just left. I don't even think they stop. They just drive by. The tool actually went down the street, put mail in the community mailbox, didn't put my shoes in there like usual, left and then claimed they made an attempt at delivery and left a notice in my door. Nope! No fukking notice on my door. I've been here the whole time solely with the purpose of being here to accept my order. It's a tough job, but thank goodness for the thankless delivery drivers that fu!k things up on a daily basis. Now it's detective time to try and figure out where they brought my order to. Avoid these goofs!"
Canada Post is GARBAGE! 40% of my packages are delivered late. Doesn't matter if it's coming in or going out. That's absolutely ridiculous. You guys are phucking USELESS!!!!!!!
"This company is a horrible company to have your items shipped to you. There is a 90% chance it will be delivered to the wrong place, not delivered at all, or it will be lost. They told me to contact the company itself and that they will open an investigation WHICH WOULD TAKE AN ADDITIONAL 5 BUSINESS DAYS. I was at first excited because it only took them 2-3 business days to have it delivered, too bad it was delivered to the wrong place. I contacted the sender and they said that they sent it to the right address. This company is a mess to deal with. Their lack of information when you call them, they are basically powerless in doing ANYTHING. DO NOT GET YOUR PACKAGES DELIVERED BY THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY. Get it together Deepak Chopra! You're an embarrassment to Canada!"
HONESTLY I WOULD GIVE THEM A NEGATIVE REVIEW IF POSSIBLE I HAVE LOST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WHY? Because Canada post likes to claim they delivered packages that were not actually delivered at all then have you talk with the company you ordered from screw you this isn't the company's fault for your incompetent employees if i did this at my place of employment id be fired
"remember when you could trust the mail service. what a shame. They have lost my drivers license. they have lost my tax return . Now somebody is running around with my id screwing up my life. Thanx Canada post, never use it again"
"NEVER use Canada post especially if you have important documents in the package! we post a passport and immigration documentation on March 9th 2017 with the kind of post that is supposed to be delivered from Toronto to Quebec in 24hrs, it was not delivered, lost and found in Manotoba! We asked them to send it back to Toronto, but it was sent to Quebec city, then Montreal, Today is March 17th and we don't know where it is or when we'll get it! We haven't slept right this week for the stress they've been putting us through!"
"I selected over night shipping on my order, wasn't processed until the next day was supposed to receive it on Thursday (order placed Tuesday) was home the entire day, was shocked it wasn't delivered checked my shipping status. Turns out i was left a notice for delivery! nobody used the door bell or knocked and I would have noticed as my dog barks at anyone who knocks or rings the bell. I have to pick my order up on Friday after one. Which is after I will have bored a plane to mexico with now one pairs on shorts instead of what should have been five. Not the first time i've been disappointed by Canadian Post... but will be the last as I will never be using a company that ships through them again. When I called to tell them about this they recommended calling the store I ordered from and ask for a refund? As if they were the ones who did this too me? I explained my time situation and was told their wasn't anything they could do even though I called at three and they deliver until six pm? really solid service! 0/10 would ever use again."
I used to trust Canada Post but it has gone down hill so badly. No more international tracking means I have no idea where my items go once they reach Canada. Seems every other country can track item but not Canada. Local delivery is even bad. I can't count how many time I have hand delivered to my neighbours as their mail ends up in my box. Makes me wonder how much of my mail I am actually missing.
"The worse service in the world. Honestly, Canada Post has gotten worse by the minute. I recently ordered an International parcel to my home address in Windsor Ontario. Unfortunately, the shipping address was not correct, after contacting customer service. I tried explaining to redirect the package to my current mailing address. They gave me such a unacceptable answer on how my delivery parcel will not be changed and that since the parcel is a registered mailing item it is not track-able in Canada. I am being honest, I wanted to give them zero stars. Poor service on the Canada Post, they really need serious upgrading on recovering undelivered items."
"canada post has been horrible, and i am not in a rual area , i have 3 packages coming the same week and even though i paid for expedited and priority those 2 packages are not delievered yet because there is one more package coming at a later date, i believe i figured out there working system scam , if they see you have a package coming at a later day during that week well they dont care if you paid all that shipping there deciding on when to come to youre house wich is when all items you ordered that week will be availlabale for delivery. whats there problem ? they dont like to deliver packages 2 days in a row , are the trying to cut down on employees and gas ? they are becoming crooks, also around christmas 2016 they actually returned my package to the store where i bought the items after waiting a week on tracking , and it never even was sent to my door . they are crooks and they should be stopted ! not the first few times ive had problems with them they do it on purpose and they dont care ! horrible delivery service !!!"
"Once a month wrong mail is delivered in my mail box, my paid for magazines will skip for a few weeks and then delivered sometime later than newer issues. Only 20% of my eBay orders from China have arrived since August 2016 (today is March 2, 2017). Since August 2016 I got 12 refunds from eBay, Banggood etcetera for stuff never delivered to my mailbox. Customer service generic answers are either CBSA or another shipping company, (China Post is usually mentioned).
If you want your items delivered, pay a few dollars more and get another service. (Alberta Province)"
"This is the second time now I've had a dealing with Canada Post. I ordered an item on the 3rd of Jan and recieved emails saying it had arrived 4 weeks later when I was actually at home and there was no parcel! So Canada Post deemed the item as lost on their behalf so the company sent out a new item which I was due to receive on the 16th of Feb but hey hoh guess what, it's now being sat at Ville St Laurent whatever that is since the 11th of Feb and I've still not recieved no item. They are making no attempt to get back in contact with me or anything. Absolute waste of space as a company. Save your money and DO NOT purchase any of their services!"
"Service has been aweful for 2 years. Receive letter destinated to other address once every 2-3 month. Missed important letter that were returned for ""addresse introuvable"" while it was the good one written (printed, not hand written). Made many complaint to Poste Canada but it never got better."
"I had ordered 2 items from 2 different companies, both were supposed to arrive around the same time. Both tracked. I have a community mailbox, and have been waiting and checking every day. When I check the tracking info, both items say ""delivered"" but I never had anything in my mailbox, nothing on my porch, and no slips to pick up from the postal office. I called the customer service number, and after navigating through an AWFUL automated system, the people I spoke with were not very helpful at all. All they could tell me is the sender has to open a ticket, and can't give any other information, but one person said the packages were ""left at the residence""
I want to know why something was left at my residence when I have a community mailbox, where they could have given me a key for one of the larger boxes (my packages definitely would have fit in there)?"
When I order a package I expect the notice to be on my door-- why are they sending notices into a locked mailbox I don't even have access to? I have been waiting for this package for months-- They failed to alert me that my package had arrived then they shipped it to China..... but I ordered it from Germany!! Now I can't even track my package. I paid for it and I don't even know where it is!! So frustrating-- They are useless -- They wont even help me locate my order-- which was very expensive!!!
"I sent a package containing personal documents. Thinking canada post could handle documents i trusted to send my documents with them, with registered mail and trackable..i sent them on the 28 of dec. 2016 it's now feb 13 2017. I opened a ""service ticket"" they dont call, i want them to pay for my documents....they assign a special agent for thre case being personal documents which they agent dont care to call me..
I regret using canada post..next time ups or something else.."
"Once a great company but now a totally useless and unreliable service for items not shipped within Canada. Out of 20 or more orders from China only 3 have arrived since October 2016 and it is now February 13, 2017. When contacted they are less than helpful if the item is from an international destination and you get different answers from different customer service reps but lately, never a solution only passing the blame to another shipping company or CBSA. I was once a loyal customer but no more. If you want to receive your items and save time, pay a little extra and get FedEx or UPS."
Terrible service
"Over the past 2 years we have been trying to get post to Vancouver and it has gone missing. It's not a tundra on an unreachable mountain peak with no electricity. It is world famous and very well connected city (apart from mail evidently, which seems to have been standard poor since 1867). I am annoyed with the consistency of failure spread over a large volume of excuses, lack of professionalism or any sense of pride. Quite frankly I would like to see the entire system overhauled by privatisation and then made to compete with commercial providers to tender for the right to be Canada's next national postal service. That should be a wake up call. #canadapostfail"
"Package on it's way to Belgium for 4 weeks. Paid over ‚Ç¨90 for shipping.
I think they ship with donkyes. It took over 4 days from local postoffice to distribution centre en nothing sins then."
"I purchased a product from states it was shipped by mail ten dollars verses 50 dollars shipping, got a email from Candace post tried sending but wrong address which was my fault I sent it to beacon hill their old address which was wiped out, I phoned imeadiatly nice lady took the new address and understood my error, she said it will be put back to be mailed, got a service ticket , then I have called twice more since and each time I was told someone would call back within 24hours, didn't happen, I called yesterday jan31, young lady Courtney answered to tell me I don't have the right service number, matter of fact to bad attitude , I asked for a manger over and over and she said I don't have right info so she could not put me to manager who at first she said wasn't there, then realized I wasn't giving up, after what seemed like forever I got s manager, and she had no care what so ever and said it was shipped back on 18 th, such a waste of my time , and aperently the post office is to busy to phone the number on the package to give us a chance to pick it up, I actually don't know where my parcel is I hope it's gone back so I can get refunded or I am out of luck,........ service and respect from Canada postüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
I run a business primarily online with a lot of shipping id say 20% of my items are either lost stolen or damaged. My clients select the cheapest option when the are traveling abroad which means no tracking. You are totally screwed then and the will do nothing for you. I'm ashamed that they have the word Canada in their name. As soon as I can find a better company to link with my E-commerce site I will dump them.
"I live in an apartment building & have a mailbox that is clearly labelled & I've had issues with my mail the entire 6 months I've lived at my new place. I've had parcels delivered to my neighbors when I'm not home to answer the door, which is annoying because how do they know my neighbors will be trustworthy? Recently I had my mom send me all of her passport information and of course it got delivered to the wrong person. After a week of waiting for a package that was express rushed, I went to inquire at the post office they weren't helpful at all! Just gave me a list of locations my parcel ""might be"" but had no idea who it was delivered to, or who signed for it. The tracking is useless because all it says was ""delivered."" I understand that mistakes happen & things get misplaced but it makes me feel like they don't care about who gets your mail & customer service sucks when dealing with lost items!! I'm not usually one to complain but I am beyond frustrated. My family & friends have given up even trying to send me anything :("
"Customer service is unprofessional on the border with idiocy and giving out false information - after half an hour of navigating through their voicemail system designed to keep customers away I got a half brain who fed me completely false information ( everything was denied by Canadian Customs official). Website is so complicated that actually to create service ticket ( needed to register a complain with Ombudsman Office) for an item from abroad is impossible.
I will NEVER EVER use their services again!
Any third world country has a better postal service, you can bet on it!
Shame!"
"I was moving from one province to another and shipped six boxes of very personal,valuable items during the Christmas rush. Not only did they arrive in excellent condition, but they all came within 7 business days! In fact all previous purchases made over the years have all arrived quickly and in good shape. No issues at all. Thanks Canada Post!"
"Have been waiting for ""out for delivery"" over a week, called to their customer service, was told that the receiver of the parcel can't do anything about it, bad attitude and no protection toward receiver"
"Canada Posts delivery performance vs what they promise at the counter is disastrous. Worse yet they accept no responsibility for their failures, do not apologize and operate in a manner that can only be described as shameless. I needed to get a check and a signed rental agreement (just a simple small envelop -- no parcel) for a vacation rental to the southern US with in 5 working days and the postal clerk assured me that their ""Expedited Mail"" would do just that. Well, it took 4 weeks. This caused all kinds of aggravation and expense -- not being able to access the rental on arrival, stopped check charges, multiple ATM withdrawal fees to get the required cash, etc, etc. Does Canada Post accept any responsibility, or even have the heart to say ""sorry this is not acceptable? Absolutely not. They are SHAMELESS."
"Worst customer service. I ordered a package worth more than $200, and it didn't show up on the expected day. So I waited 3 days before contacting them, and I contacted them three times, before I lost my sh!t and demanded to speak to a manager.

The person on the other line had no problem showing attitude, sighing as loud as they can and raising their voice on me. I was on the verge of crying considering my package was worth more than $200.

I told customer service ""you lost my package."" And they denied it. Me being frustrated I asked them ""then why can't you track it?"" With them replying with ""sorry for your inconvenience."" I asked how they can be so irresponsible, if they run such a huge company, and that it is absolutely un-expectable.

Can't believe they are even able to run a business, with rude customer service, and drivers that loose packages. This explains why the hold time is always long, because there's so many people complaining about their problems with this irresponsible company."
"I am waiting for my passport from us counslate ottawa. Funny part is 2 days before they picked up the document and shows status on canada post but still no update to receive/pick up.
This is wiered how long it takes for them to show that customer can collect document when it is in same post office.
Response i get from representative is more scary that it may be today it may be next week or later.
I hope there is some specific time it can give to customers . I think some smaller countries will have better service than canada post."
A package was sent out to me from the US shipping cost from there to Canada was $57.15. Checking the package it says return to sender for incomplete address. No one contacted me in reference to this package. I called customer service to update the package however they couldn't assist even though the package is still in the country. Now my question is what is the use of the telephone number? I have to now pay another $57.15 to receive my package. Great customer service! #1 shipping Agent in Canada.
"So my parcel is 3 weeks since it's last scan, and apparently all I can do is get the sender to call so they can open an investigation. It was sent from China so that would prove next to impossible.
And since it's my property, and made it through customs and apparently was ""in transit"" from Vancouver, the obligation is on the sender. Great logic there.
If I get that to happen, they'll monitor it for a month before dealing with it. A month??
Calling Canada post is completely useless. It must be the easiest job in the world answering a phone and just telling people there's nothing you can do all day, everyday.
I've dealt with all the couriers and always the person your talking with has the ability to tell you something, more then what the tracking details provide.
I used to have good opinions of Canada Post but they've lost my business."
"We ordered on Dec22,still waiting.Calgary to Victoria, its now total 22 days, I know its over Christmas,but its been in Richmond BC since Dec 29th.The date today is Jan 09

"I sent a parcel from Europe..only to find out after I was using the wrong postcode !!! Of course I then thought ok it will not be delivered.It was re-addressed by Canadian post and successfully delivered.
Thank you very much"
"I decided to pay extra for Xpresspost for god knows why (don't EVER do it, you'll be sadly and utterly disappointed). First, I read online that nationally, it takes 2-3 business days. Okay. That's reasonable. My order was shipped on the 2nd from Vancouver and now it's the 6th. The 6th was the original delivery date and now it's the 9th. WHAT. THE. HELL? HUH? HOW? WHAT? Did I pay extra for SLOWER mail than usual? H-E-L-L NO.

Also: My last delivery with Canada Post ended in a tragedy. The mailman probably was high or drunk or something (I've heard rumors they don't give a damn about getting the job done right). As I was saying, he didn't even have the package handy. He literally walked up to our front door and put the notice that I needed to go to their offices to pick it up. And guess what else? They were closed that day. What is this atrocious system that they've set up? QUALITY CONTROL, PEOPLE. The managers/supervisors need to stop going to Tim Horton's every goddamn hour and discipline their employees and make sure they're doing qualitywork. Jesus Christ Almighty you guys have triggered me.

ANOTHER THING: I have class on the 9th, the day my package is supposedly going to be delivered (with them, it'll be a month before I get it). That means I'll get the delivery notice. And guess what else? I don't live in this area, as i'm only here for school so my license/proof of address won't work here. Awesome. JUST. AWESOME. I spent a lot of money on this package and they only ship via Canada Post, and I just knew it would end like this. My package had better be in good condition at the VERY LEAST and it'd better be dusted in gold for how long you guys have been jerking around with it.

To readers: Use UPS. or pay for priority mail. It's not worth the rage this company causes you. I'm paying for priority mail next time. Yes that's right, the $40 shipping cause these guys can't guarantee S H I T.

P.S the woman who I talked to over the phone kept trying to brush me off. ""Sir, there's nothing I can do."" Why do they even exist then? QUALITY CONTROL. STOP PAYING EMPLOYEES THAT SIT AROUND TO TELL CUSTOMERS THAT THEY CAN'T HELP THEM. MY GRAN CAN DO THAT AND SHE'S DEAD"
"I rarely write negative reviews, but I felt compelled to write one of the Canada Post office in Campbell River, BC after I had a horrible experience with them. Sometimes one's patience becomes worn out, and my patience with Canada Post has run out to the point I absolutely will not use them anymore for packages or shipments where time is important. I was expecting a package from California to Campbell River. On 12/19, the package was listed as being in Campbell River and the status was ""Item out for delivery""; however, shortly afterwards, the status was updated as ""Verifying recipient's address; Possible delay"".

I thought that was odd, so I phoned the sender back in California to confirm the address which was indeed correct. So, I went down to the local Campbell River Canada Post's office to see what was going on and to solve this issue. I even printed out the tracking log information off the website to show the front-desk agents which details the status of where my parcel went. The lady at the counter went back to the storage room and did not find my parcel. She stated to me that ""no supervisor was in today"" and that they will be in the next morning to help me out. She even took down my phone number and promised me that the supervisor will contact me the next day. I thought ""How nice. Someone will get to the bottom of this and help me out."". She stated she will place the tracking log paper that I gave her on her supervisor's desk, so that it ""will be the first thing the supervisor sees when they arrive next morning "" (her exact words).

However, I never received a phone call the next day, so I visited the CP office again on the same day and spoke with another lady who once again stated to me that ""no supervisor is in today"". Now wait a minute, the other agent told me yesterday that a supervisor would be in today. Once again, she made an empty promise that someone will phone me tomorrow and that my tracking log paper ""will be the first thing the supervisor sees in the morning"" (again, exact words). Yet, low and behold, nobody contacted me the next day. Great.

I tried phoning Canada Post's customer service phone line to find out the problem with my package and why it hasn't been delivered, but it is impossible to get ahold of any agent. Instead, you get automated messages which are useless. I was told over the phone the wait time is over ten minutes to speak to an agent. I waited 2 hours and could not get ahold of any customer service agent, so I gave up and hanged up the phone. By this time, I was getting frustrated.

Then on 12/22, I learned through the Canada Post tracking webpage that my package was now in Richmond, BC at YVR being sent back to the States despite the fact that it was already right here in Campbell River. If only someone at the Campbell River Post office would have phoned me back, or if I was able to get ahold of an agent over the phone, this could've been prevented. I really needed this package in time for important work-related purposes.

All in all, the customer service at the Campbell River's office is shady and awful. They like to make empty promises that go nowhere. They promised me that a supervisor would contact me to figure out what happened to my package, but I received no phone call. I feel the front-desk agents at this office will tell you what you want to hear with little or no action just to get you out of the door. On top of that, it is impossible to get ahold of anyone on their phone line. Shame on you Canada Post. Thanks a lot for screwing me over. I will never use your service again, and I will be sure to use FedEx or UPS next time. And I will be sure to tell everyone in town about your crappy service and to not recommend Canada Post."
"I don't know if this problem is systemic wide or just in my area. Letters mailed from out of province to me in Kitchener take 3 weeks to arrive, when letters in the same batch that were mailed out, reach other destinations, even cross country in 1 week. I get utility bills almost 3 weeks after they're dated and 5 days before they're due
A large envelope sent to me mid November was returned to the sender one month later with ""NSA"" written on the envelope. So, was it delivered to the wrong address?????
This week, we've only had mail delivery on our street once out of 4 days. Rarely do we ever get mail delivery more than 3 days a week.
I have logged many online and phone tickets and no one gets back to me with an explanation of what is going on here.
It's truly pathetic when you have to pay for a tracking number for an envelope because a postal service is too inept to perform the simplest task of delivering envelopes."
"I ordered a Christmas gift which was guaranteed delivery on or before Dec. 23rd. The Canada Post tracking sheet showed item was dropped off in the mailbox but it wasn't there. When I called Canada Post I was told they would open a ticket but that matter may be resolved only about Dec. 30th. I think they either dropped off the parcel in a wrong mailbox or they dropped it in the community mailbox and forgot to drop off the key for me. Either which way, I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. I do sometimes get letters marked to my neighbours which I promptly deliver and vice versa."
"These guys at canada post are unbelievably stupid.
Customer service is the WORST. I had to repeat myself literally 10 times.
Now i can't even get thought to them to get my money back on the insurance i paid for on a tracking that got stolen and they are not accepting calls today due to high volume. LOL not kidding you guys SUCK!!!
Unbelievable the lack of professionalism in this company. WOW.

Lost for words :O"
"Still waiting for a package that was shipped by priority shipping with next day delivery guarantee. It's been almost a week now. Can't track the package as they don't update the system regularly. IMO this is got to be the worst postal service on the planet, I will definitely never use canada post service again."
"Now I know. I will never again use the canada post to send an item that costs 300euros or anything else less valuable. They are impeccable and liers. They lost my package, they don't have international tracking system and they tried to defame me to my client that I didn't give her a valid tracking number or I didn't ship the bag. It was impossible to communicate with them by phone and I suppose I will have to wait for a long time to answer me at my research application. In the meantime I have to fully refund without knowing what happened with the parcel.
Canada post you suck, worst than a third party country. Five stars minus! !"
"We live in Lindsay Ontario. The mail service is very poor, going into the post office is an hour or hours event. Not only are the counter staff slow and ill prepared for their jobs. They constantly disappear into the back when customers are waiting. They seem as though they have no boss and do as they please. I am all for people working as long as they need to. But they need to be able to do their job. One finger typing, gabbing,and constant smoke breaks, or coffee breaks does not get the job done. The smell of smoke on them when they do return, is sickening. If in fact they have a supervisor he os she needs to be replaced."
"Xpress Post: It took 10 days for this mind-blowingly lazy, complacent and incompetent business entity to deliver a letter from Oakville to Burlington (distance about 15km).

This happens time and again - what's more, they don't even deliver letters to my door any more. I have to walk up the street to pick up my piles of unwanted junk mail and late-delivered bills.

I can't wait for companies like Amazon to take these clowns out of the picture once and for all. Good bye and good riddance Canada Post!"
"I dont have negative stars options so i am giving 1 start. The worst service anyone would expect. They don't have answer to the shipment tracks. Agents are so reluctant and they dont have a clue about the item. Shocking to hear that it is canadian and so worse... Even small courier services do better service than Canada Post.

If you are sending something important just dont use Canada Post."
"Horrible service every time, expess post is never on time, when you call them they have no idea where your package is, or how long it will take to get there. Will no longer use this so called service. A man on horse back could get it there quicker. How is it a company in business this long is so crummy?"
"Honestly the worst mail company in Canada and probably in the world as well. Horrible lethargic service, with long delays. I used Xpress Post so that I can receive the package in one day but it has been three days and still haven't received it yet! It's being ""processed"" for about 17 hours now and I am sure it doesn't take 4 days to ship from Toronto to Kingston.

Would not recommend their service to anyone. Customer service is horrible as well as they provide no help at all. Tracking a package doesn't help either as they don't update it often. Overall, horrible service."
"10 days for stamps and they're still not here!!

Ordered stamps online since I didn't want to wait at the post office in the long Christmas lines. Ordered the stamps on November 30th. It's now the 8th and my mail has been delivered with still no stamps.
I called customer service to cancel the order since I now had no choice but to go to the post office and wasted an hour of my time with 4 separate agents that I was escalated to only to hear the same nonsense from all of them. They WON'T CANCEL my order and when the stamps do arrive, I'll have to go back to the post office to return them - UNBELIEVABLE!!

It is shameful to see how our tax dollars are so clearly wasted on inefficient, archaic forms of bureaucracy which only serve those who are employed by it. To think that I subsidize the wages for the employees who so quickly and artfully said ""NO"" to every reasonable request I made. I simply wanted my money back so I could buy some stamps for the mountain of christmas cards that are sitting at my door waiting to be mailed. Instead, I'm left with a horrible taste in my mouth about how our Canadian institutions service their clients - shamefully!

Moving forward, I will do everything to avoid ever having to put any money into Canada Post and I can assure you I will no longer be supporting any of their campaigns.

Amazon can get you heavy items in a day, Canada Post can't mail stamps in 10 days...UNACCEPTABLE!

WORST SERVICE EVER!!
I WILL NEVER USE YOU AGAIN!"
whats the point of taking package if you are unable to deliver?????
"Tell me, what's the point in paying for xpresspost if you're well aware orders won't able to reach their destinations on time? You're taking advantage of the situation/customers and it's not acceptable. Consider yourselves lucky you aren't privatized.

It's the same story every black Friday. Fact of the matter is, there's a principle involved. When someone selects their preferred method of shipping that includes a tracking # and delivery date; the consumers expect (at the very least) for tracking information to be updated regularly and not once every three days!"
"Worst service ever ...tracking says package delivered haven't received anything yet ...and it's not the first time ..this is normal for this garbage called Canada post ...anything coming from china and Hong Kong ...Singapore post takes about 30-60 days seriously
What are you guys smoking ?"
"They marked tracking number as delivered to my a dress on Dec 2, 2016. but it was never received. Customer service has poorest knowedge of problem solving.
Update
On Dec 7, 2016 someone from a nearby street brought the parcel to my adress she said it was left at her door."
"Crown Corporation opt out: Important: We're working hard to process and deliver record holiday parcel volumes as quickly as possible. Please note that it may take up to 24 hours for customers to see tracking information on our website. In some cases, customers may also experience a delay in delivery. We continue to devote extra resources to serve you and apologize for any delays

Full disclosure aside, why is it that a package dispatched from Mississauga to an address in Mississauga, a distance of maximum seven kilometres, was sent instead to Stoney Creek for sorting, a round trip of about 100 kilometres. The package has yet to be delivered over four days past scheduled delivery. Am I missing something subtle here? We all know that we would be sacked if we did something as stupid as this where we work.
And talking of deliveries, a very expensive laptop was left on our porch as the Canada Post delivery man could not be bothered to even ring the doorbell. Perhaps the powers that be, occupying jobs for life, ought to monitor news reports of people cruising streets to steal parcels from porches."
"Canada post fails to deliver packages on time on the regular, spending time ""processing"" the package for much too long. When packages arrive, they often don't even knock and just leave their little paper slip. Government employees should not be in charge of mail, and Canada Post shows what happens when you let incompetence run the show."
