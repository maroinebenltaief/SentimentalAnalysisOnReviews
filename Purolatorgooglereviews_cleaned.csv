review-full-text
The person working at the purolator here took my item after I left it to be returned to amazon (its been a week and amazon didn't get it back yet). I forget her name but I highly recommend NOT USING THIS LOCATION.Caio Uechi in the reviews posted her picture. How she still has a job here is beyond me.
"This Purolator drop off counter is located inside the Staples downtown Toronto at 375 University ave. The lady at the counter who took my Amazon return box was quite pleasant, and even though at the time of drop-off, the staff at this location don't scan return parcels or give a receipt as proof they have received your return parcel, the lady assured me that Purolator picks up parcels at 5pm.Needless to say, I tracked it and it was delivered to the Amazon shipping dock at 5.25am (12 hrs after it was picked up from the Staples Purolator drop off counter).Please note that in addition to Purolator, this location also offers shipping services for FedEx and DHL, each with specific daily cut-off time for courier pick-up. I've attached photos"
"Normally I don't really care about delivery times / reviews, but Purolator really came through for me this week. I ordered a winter Jacket from the Bay in mid-November, at first it was supposed to be delivered through TForce logistics, but after 4 weeks they failed to send it to me, and ended up returning it to the Bay.I was really upset as it looked like I was going to be going without a coat for a big chunk of the winter, but then as soon as the coat was sent back to the Bay, the Bay switched the order to Purolator, and it was delivered LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY. Purolator did an amazing job, and I would recommend hiring them over TForce any day of the week."
"Only problems after problems after communication issues.One person tells you something, another tells you different, and at the end of the day you always have to pick  up your packages at their warehouse ! Often they don't even buzz you, they just update their web site saying that your package is available for pick up... because it's better that way!Honestly the less you deal with them the better !!!When is this company going out of business???Please and thank you!"
"Went here for a return shipment to Amazon. They won’t print the label for you… so you’ll have to spend 10 cents to print it out in the Staples print section. How cheap can a company be? The staff seemed disorganized and there were many people waiting. Other than that, the shipment was picked up and delivered to Amazon with no problems."
The worst shipping company ever.   I have been waiting for my shipment all day and it says item on vehicle with courier since 9 am and then at the end of the day it says address correction needed while my address is correct.  The courier didn't dial the superintendent building so he can get in and drop my item by my unit number.   Instead left a message on my tracking online without even leaving a paper note by the lobby entrance as they usually do which totally mean this driver never even made it to my building.  I went down 10 mins after tracking showed update.  There is no way paper would disappear in 10 mins.   I despise the service from this company due to the absolute humiliating service and lack of adequate management to control the quality of their drivers.    Why hire people who don't do their job.   My tracking number is 332605931598.   Do something about this driver and show some care to your customers !!!   This is absolutely bizzar. I am not so frustrated with this service.  I will never ever use this courier again !!!!    I have to wait till Monday now because the driver did it just before cut off time.  How convenient !!
"I was the whole day at home after a huge delay times, over 5 days they say they attemped to delivery and I was here the whole day in my home,  the costumer service is worst of any other place, I give 1 star because I can't give 0 stars. from all the delivery Purolator is the worst. Better cancel your package until they set other delivery company."
"UPDATE: Purolator has refused to issue a refund, stating that the situation was out of their control, despite abysmal customer service and zero communication... Worst courier service ever!Purolator, the company of choice when you want to pay 100$ to have your documents lost... Despite being told that my guaranteed delivery was BEFORE 10:30 am on Thursday (October 25), it has yet to be delivered AND no one can tell me where the package is.So far various Purolator agents have:1. Told me that a tracking specialist would call me with an update today-- Never happened2. Blamed me for dropping off the package too late--I paid for next available drop off date, which was Thursday morning, how exactly is this my fault...3. Confirmed that the current location of my package is unknown and I just have to ""wait it off""4. Dragged their heels with issuing a refund, which honestly should have been generated instantly when they missed the ""guaranteed delivery service""5. Provided no apology, next steps, or solutionsI feel incredibly guilty that my friend's Visa application is now delayed because I chose an unreliable courier with terrible customer service. Future customers be warned, avoid Purolator! I hear carrier pigeons are more reliable these days..."
"UPDATE: They delivered  it to the wrong house, luckily for me my neighbor didn't steal it and brought it to my house, giving it a higher review because if they actually got the right house the delivery time would have been crazy fast.They lied about my package being delivered XD... I was literally waiting by the door and nobody came but the delivered notification appeared. Man... where the hell is my new phone :c"
Great location -- right in the middle of the Staples super store on University Avenue just south of Dundas on the east side.Staff are very friendly and helpful and will ensure your package gets to where it needs to be. Makes shipping super easy. Great spot!
"Another city, another Purolator depot, another delivery service that constantly loses my packages. I am no longer surprised whatsoever.This time? They've lost a QUEEN SIZED BED! It arrived in Toronto on the 2nd and has been sitting in their depot ever since (it is now the 19th). Worse still, after a few messages with customer service on Facebook, Twitter, and now Email... It seems they've decided to just... Ignore my attempts to find the package and are refusing to provide any further updates! Fantastic.Folks, if the website tells you your product was shipped by Purolator... Just contact the store and insist they refund or reissue the order under a different courier. It'll be quicker, and you'll be right most of the time!"
"Review for Purolator in general. Courier claims to have attempted delivery 3 times. I was home the entire time span of his attempted deliveries. They didn't attempt to contact me once.Tried to contact them via phone, but i hung up after waiting for 30 minutes. Tried via their online chat, which is a broken chat bot.I then tried to go to the closest store, on University Street, Toronto. They couldn't offer any assistance except for the public custom service line.I'd avoid using them if i could."
"What Fabrizio said... and this is hell for someone who's disabled and cannot easily get around.""""oh so i see you're not home during work hours..maybe you're working...its OK ill come back tomorrow same time while you're working, actually nvm that, let me put your packages in the single most farthest location, thus defeating the purpose of delivery altogether"" Purolator is peak fail in this industry."""
Just save your time and avoid Purolator. My manager sent my new truck registration and place number from Calgary to Toronto. She sent it by over night delivery Express. Purolator couldn't locate my package. I am stuck with my brand new truck in Toronto for days and losing money each day . Truckers make money when truck tires start to role.
"The worst courier in existence.I only face delivery issues with Purolator. The latest was a package being returned by the driver as he couldn't get a signature. The package is marked no signature required!On top of that they scheduled delivery for Wednesday, I then got a notification after I'd left my apartment on Saturday that it was out for delivery. I can't understand why this company is so badly run.The only information I received is that the delivery was unsuccessful and to consult the notice left behind. There is no notice left behind. Disaster yet again with them. Customers should not have to rely on Purolator to deliver their packages as it goes wrong far too often."
"Nothing against people in this location but overall Purolator is the worst courier out there. They don’t even follow instructions. Not the first time I was home and they just leave a note with the concierge, no knock, no telephone, not even an email notification. I haven’t had one good experience with this company. I would never use them directly, so really surprised retailers do (guessing they probably cheap out)"
"Not a review for this location but Purolator in general is the worst!! I have never had this issue with other carriers. They didn’t follow my instructions & I had to ultimately go to pick up my package. A little attention on their part could have done wonders for me! But they simply DON’T CARE!! Highly disappointed!!Also, if the delivery guy is coming to deliver the parcel to my place, at least notify me!! Am I expected to dream about it?? Very bad service & organisation!!"
"I just received a parcel  it actually belonged to a shop next door, this delivery guy just came didnt verify the address handed over the parcel to me and started walking away, i immediately saw the address i called him excuse me sir!! Hello !! Excuse me!! He kept on walking went straight n sat in the vehicle i literally ran after him i knocked on the window but this guy pretended to be deaf or as if i was invisible!! He didnt respond at all, and he left,  he just didnt acknowledge at all. Its not about that i had to go and deliver the package to the address it belonged thats ok , whats not ok is the RUDE BEHAVIOUR. Its so so WRONG!I dont think this is the way to treat the customer or anybody for that matter."
"Where do they hire the people here.  Just dropping off a package.  Woman at the counter looking at screen. I say “Good Morning”. She doesn’t look up and just says “Wait”.  Really?  Can’t say “good morning, please give me a minute”?I also really dislike you drop packages off but they give you no receipt or acknowledgment of your package. If it’s lost, it’s lost. You have no record with them. Ridiculous."
"I am seeing so many reviews about people experiencing drivers who are leaving attempted to deliver stickers at their homes but while the party was at home and the driver did not knock or buzz. I’ve faced this issue many times whenever having an order delivered by Purolator.I had a very important package being delivered today that I needed for my office tomorrow. I began tracking my item from 730 this morning and kept checking updates throughout the day. I stayed close enough to my front door to be able to hear anyone knock. After waiting all morning and early afternoon - I saw an update online that a delivery was attempted so I checked my door and sure enough there was that dreaded sticker. So I am confirming that the driver absolutely did not knock as I was home within earshot of my door all day. I now have to drive 20 mins away to pick this item up tomorrow which defeats the entire benefit of next day home delivery. I could have just purchased this item in store (which is 10 mins away) the day before and not had to wait 2 extra days. Is purolator ever going to set some standards and perform quality audits on their drivers? Perhaps a certain percentage of delivered packages being expected to maintain quality standards (with reasonable exceptions of course)? Maybe throw in some customer service and client etiquette training as well (as many of the drivers are so unfriendly).There are many new delivery providers being used lately by retail stores and they are amazing, on time and friendly. They even try to contact you by phone right before to confirm delivery. Fleet optics for example is amazing. I’ve also been receiving items with no delivery issues from Cross North Delivery inc. Purolator take notes before all of the larger retail stores start switching their delivery service provider."
"Just avoid having anything sent by Purolator, save yourself the headache. Scheduling a delivery means they *might* knock on your door within a 13 hour time frame.You're almost guaranteed to have to  pick up your package at their very inconvenient location in Etobicoke (even if you live downtown TO). Why?Why can't they text/call us at a provided # when they arrive for the signature & drop-off? Would save everyone time, money and frustration. Really makes no sense."
"Without getting into details, we I requested a there stop shipment because the address was incorrect and the only time they could deliver was 2 days later but the contents of the package needed to in the hands of someone the next day.The gentleman at the front counter used part of his break to go get the package. He went beyond his regular duties to make sure I got the package and I'd like to thank him. I didn't get his name but he was working at on Monday July 9th, at 6:30pm."
"Worse experience. All my orders always have my buzzer code kn them. Today Purolator supposedly came and couldn't get in because of my buzzer code. I signed up for notifications  prior to delivery  knowing how I would NEVER get my items. I was rightI have a broken foot and they want me to come get my item but the kicker is, I'd have to wait until January to even get it. If I wanted it delivered yet again, I'd still have to wait. At no time dis anyone make a conscious effort to text  call or try to enter into the business to deliver mybitems. But they will male the excuse it's the holidays why this happened. It wouldn't of mattered either way, because the driver would still NOT deliver to the apt. All they ever do is leave stickers claiming they couldn't get a buzzer code amd leave the that message inside the apt hallway amd not go up to theWhat a horrible system and service."
Absolutely terrible service! I can't believe how careless  most of these drivers are to not use the buzzer codes I provided for my condo (are they that lazy and careless? and So many customer service reps giving me wrong information and very nasty attitudes..I will do my best to avoid using this service from now on. horrible horrible employees
"Ugh, every time I see Purolator has my package, I think what fresh hell is this, what horrible thing have I done in a past life to be punished this poorly. This entire organization is a massive waste of taxpayers money (look it up, owned by Canada Post). There's no way this company makes money unless poor customer service and assinine corprate decisions is some how a profitable act. (it isn't, I checked). The level of ineptitude that is displayed must be deliberate, for no one person can truly be that frustratingly stupid. Yet here you sit, I hope that guilt and circumstance crush you all."
"Never have had a problem here! Always in and out with no hassle! The staff are always kind and friendly!I print off my own labels at home so maybe if others did that too, they wouldn't have so much to complain about when doing returns. Just saying..."
"Purolator (the delivery company with LATER misspelled right there in it’s name) has never, in the past 30 years, ever successfully delivered a package to me. Today their track record remains unsullied: 2 failed delivery attempts, no failed delivery attempt notices left anywhere in the property, and customer service has no answers. How is this company still in business????UPDATE: my package, which was promised to be held at the depot after the first failed delivery attempt, was put back on the truck and failed a 2nd delivery attempt, whereupon it was supposed to be held for pickup at the depot. Of course that didn’t happen, and the package went back on (or never came off) the truck for yet another (3rd) attempted delivery.The chat it was truly useless.All of the phone agents I spoke with (each after a 30+minute wait time on hold) we’re equally ill equipped to find my package or help IN ANY WAY.FedEx, UPS the USPS & CanadaPost outperform you in every way, every day, every time 🤡"
"I got a notice to get my package from the pickup place within 5 days but the package never arrived at the pickup place!!Based on their tracking notifications, they have kept my package for one week in their facility  instead of sending it to the pickup place they themselves provided in their notice!! Why even bother with a notice if the package wouldn't go to the address in the notice?It takes more than one hour to be able to talk to a human being and they don't do anything as well. At this point I'm not even sure my package is actually at the facility/locker. Their notifications are changing everyday but the package has never been sent to the pickup place (which is literally 2 minutes away from the initial address).I was not the person who chose Purolator for this shipment but I for sure will never chose them in the future with this experience!"
"They don't listen to the customer or guide them with an actionable step. I was showing them the status of my package as 'returned / undelivered' on Purolator website and the lady at the counter just kept saying 'in my system, it shows it was already delivered'. Aren't those two systems supposed to say the same things? If it's not, is it my problem? Instead of providing a solution, she just gave me templated answer."
"Purolator has always been particularly heinous to deal with—I am not sure if it is this single branch that is responsible for the ineptitude of it service in Etobicoke, but I do know that, if I am given the option, I would rather a parcel not be shipped at all then to be sent via Purolator to my home in Bloor West Village. I have never been notified that a parcel is out for delivery. I have also never been informed that a parcel is being held for pick up. It has always been my sole responsibility to track products I have paid for down. Whether a parcel is in transit, being held for pick up, or if it has been returned to sender—there has been no service provided to me as a residential client—ever. I would suggest that anyone who knows a product they have ordered will be sent via Purolator to find another option, or rethink their purchase entirely. The company obviously does not care about or prioritize residential services. In the 10 years I have lived in this area they have never become any more reliable or user-friendly. Generally, when I do catch I missed delivery, by happening to look up my delivery online, it is being held at a distanct pick-up point too remote for me to access. Customer service has never been effective in resolving any issue I have had with the company service. As I say, I would not recommend providing any business to them whatsoever. Find another option or dispense with them. There are better ways to waste your time and money."
"Tuesday: Driver never tried to deliver my order. According to the rep I spoke with today he says he left a notice with our concierge but the concierge doesn't start working until 1PM and the delivery happened at 8:45AM. We were never buzzed or called, they just showed up, stuck a note on the door, and left.Tuesday Night: I called them for redelivery today and the rep I spoke with said the order would be delivered on Thursday because the centre was closed and he wouldn't be able to get it out for tomorrow.Thursday (today): Checked the tracking this morning and it's at the depot awaiting pickup. Called a different rep, they stated that it wasn't scheduled for delivery today and that they would try to redeliver the package within 1-3 business days. I told them the parcel was scheduled to be returned before then. They said if that's the case, they couldn't assure me it would be delivered before it was sent back and that I had to come pick it up.TL;DR: They said they attempted to deliver the package, ""left a notice"" with someone who wasn't even working at that time, said they would redeliver it, didn't redeliver it, said they would redeliver it AGAIN, and then said I would have to pick it up or it would be sent back."
"Delivery drivers that fake delivery attempts (this has happened several times even after giving Purolator permission to leave packages at the home), no knock on the door at all, now I have to go out to a distant location to pick up a package. Sadly a company that doesn't care about customer service since it's had this reputation for years."
"I came to pick up a package during regular hours... it's 4:30 p.m. on a Tuesday and the office is closed. The phone number states closing hours for service is 10 p.m. and nobody was available to take a call. There were no signs or updates about the location being closed. In the 5 mins I was sitting outside, I saw at least 10 people come to see it was closed. Unprofessional. It's inconvenient coming out here all to not be be open."
Purolator is the absolute worst courier service! I'd never use them ever again. When they miss your delivery (signature required) and they leave that notice and tell you where the package will be left (drop center) it NEVER gets to that drop center and you are left going around in circles trying to find the package. Customer service line always has a 45 minute wait time and they are pretty useless as well!!!! Repeated bad experience! NEVER AGAIN!!!!
"Unfair,  Purolator people come to deliver and they didn't call and just bring back the things and put notices,  sorry we missed . And after that we have to pick the things from far away like Kipling ave etc. Who is staying week days at home and why they didn't call about our parcel.  We are completely disappointed and we don't like Purolator services."
"It was a great experience at the center, I walked in to return an Amazon parcel. The lady there was more than helpful, she printed me the Amazon return label, which she said, they normally don't do. However, after I came home, I realized, even after 2 weeks of returning an item, my money hasn't been refunded. When called Amazon, I got to know that for some reason, the package has been received by Amazon, but it is not entered at the Purolator office that the package has been returned. So for some reason, although I had a great experience at this center, the center didn't do its job well. I'm sorry, I wanted to give 5 stars, but this is something that they do everyday and such ignorance was not expected."
"Do not ""drop off"" your Amazon returns without watching them scan it. I come to this location often and most of the staff members are fine. I had a bad feeling about one of them, I should've trusted my gut feeling. She was helping another customer and repeatedly said ""don't worry"" to me (I should've worried) and that she'll scan it. Insisting that I didn't have to wait. Over $200 worth of return has still not been issued because Amazon has not received the return items even though I dropped it off a week ago. While another item I returned just YESTERDAY through Canada Post has been received and a refund has been issued. I don't understand why Purolator is the ONLY option for most product returns."
"The only reason for not giving this location 1 star, is the friendly staff.Since installing the Amazon label printer, this place is slammed, yet operated like a small booth. Don’t let the huge distribution centre fool you, if you’re sending a package, there’s only 1 person manning the centre.AND- can you PLEASE put up proper signage and instruction for the AMAZON returns kiosk. Every time I’m in there I show several people how to use it. I KNOW there’s a sign- but CLEARLY it isn’t working.How about this:AMAZON RETURNSScan your QR code here.Hold your phone 6” from the green light.NOTE: DO NOT put your package on the scale.Not that hard. Just do it and watch that line move faster. YOU’RE WELCOME"
"Terrible Experience.First, they received my package.. only to send it back to Quebec. Then when it gets returned, I get a notification to ""contact them"". After 5 chats of the agents not being able to identify what the problem was, they finally tell me ""Oh, we broke some of the containers, do you want the remainder?"". I asked them if there would be compensation, they said no. I asked them to return it, but now I have to deal with the seller company for returns. It took them 4 business days just to tell me ""yea, we broke it"", What should have been a 2 day delivery turned into a 2 week ordeal of many chats and phone calls just to find out what happened.It really worries me that the logistics in Canada is so lackluster. It's no wonder our productivity is lagging other countries so much, with companies like Purolator.Update: Saga continues. I had asked Purolator to send the remains back to the seller so that I could be sent new ones (out of stock.. so maybe refund). On the following Monday, it gets dropped off at my door. Great. Now I must have them pick it up, ship it back, further delays. /Slow ClapEdit: Added one star for Purolator responding, and because some of their staff were decent individuals.Edit 2: They lost another parcel. Shipped from Oakville (25min drive) week later after delays due to “mechanical issues “, they lost it."
"Best customer service of my life picking up a package earlier this evening from Niki and Lash. They were both so sweet and created a welcoming atmosphere. I came a day early because I misread the label, but Niki said no problem and ran through the wind and rain over to the warehouse and got me my package in less than five minutes. I didn't even ask her to do it she just did it for me. Absolutely amazing staff!! Thank you!"
I had a horrible experience and will never use Purolator again. First the driver never attempts the delivery. Then the 1st customer service agent says the package will be resent the next day. Next day it still says unknown delivery so I call again and she says the other agent put the package on hold by accident and it will get resent. Then I get a notification that it's ready for pick up in the next city over.  Call a third time and now they say it won't get reshipped till next week. So a package that was supposed to be priority for next day is now taking 6 days
"Received friendly and extremely helpful service from two representatives at the location. I missed an extremely important package by 15 mins and needed it the same day but the slip said it wouldn’t be available till next day. Called customer service and they contacted both the driver and the sorting facility to draw extra attention to my package and hopefully get it at the sorting facility by closing time. When I got there in the evening  Tanya informed me my package hasn’t arrived yet and it should be there at 8pm. At 7:55 I received a text message that my package was ready for pick up. Surely, both her and Jahmaine had all 3 of my boxes scanned and ready for me to pick up. I had a less helpful experience at a different location but the staff here definitely made up for that."
"Honestly Purolator is the WORST courier company in Canada. Stick to FedEx or UPS friends.I bought an item that I need for work through a company, who then later arranged shipment of said item between their two stores through Purolator, and I was provided the tracking number to follow the item across the country. The package moved pretty well on its initial day of scanning within it’s origin province, and then it stopped moving altogether for 4 business days, and it never left it’s origin province after the first day. Once I called into customer service to inquire about this, the tracking was updated with a notice, ‘delayed in transit due to missed connection.’ 🤔 The last time I checked, boxes don’t get on planes by themselves, it’s PEOPLE who put boxes on planes, so this situation is telling me that someone at Purolator isn’t doing their job.I called back to into customer service, and after sitting on hold for nearly AN HOUR, I requested to speak with a supervisor to try and sort this situation out. When this guy came on the line, his replies were just NASTY and full of attitude, and he barely even let me speak. He talked all over my responses, would not allow me to speak, nor would he give me any updates on my shipment as if a problem simply didn’t exist. It was just “on it’s way”, with no room for questions or digging deeper to find out why this occurred. Un-freaking-real! 😤 His attitude just floored me, considering that he’s supposed to be a problem solving “supervisor/manager”. His attitude was truly disgusting, and because that is the type of person Purolator chooses to have represent their company, they have now lost me as a client, and can surely count on me to NEVER encourage others to utilize their service either. Simply disgusting customer service from start to finish."
"This is the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with. If you ever need to send or receive a package don't even bother with them, spend your money literally anywhere else. I needed to get a package on time, with urgency. Paid for speedy delivery, spoke to 5 people including a supervisor and explained the situation. My package did not make it to get on a flight the next day. They didn't even have the common decency to call me back to inform me why and apologize. Customer service means nothing to you. I even offered to go pick up the package from whatever facility it is being held at because that is how urgently I needed it and nothing from you people. I will NEVER use you again. I will avoid buying anything from a company that uses you as their provider."
I highly discourage shipping through Purolator. I just found out that they no longer offer receipts when you drop something off so there is no proper chain of custody to ensure you dropped off some thing. Tracking numbers are not the proof that you actually dropped something off. I’m not I’m not sure when this stopped but it must be in the last six months or so. Very poor experience and even worse when I called in asking about this policy change. I will definitely be choosing another shipping company going forward.
"For some reason they could not deliver amazon package.Even though I get 3 packages a week.Never a problem , they usually toss them in mailroom, send a pic.So they send text telling me to pick up package at Purolator.  Call the 1800 # virtual helper cannot understand what I'm saying...so I'll just leave it there .This isn't the first time issues Purolator....Amazon is so smooth , however they should drop Purolator"
Lashree what an incredible person to deal with!!! I called twice head office to make sure parcel could be picked that was not delivered due to wrong address on delivery from shipper. Purolator staff wrongfully put it out for next day delivery which would make me miss an important trade show. When all staff said it was impossible to retrieve it with an attitude Lashree calmly new the urgency and called her manager Anna to find away to get me the parcel. She search through the warehouse almost at closing and found it. Thank so much again for your all your help i hope Purolator see the value in having a person like you. Cheers to better and higher positions within the company.Danny
"If you want your package guaranteed delivered never, use Purolator. Not only are they inconsistent and are worse than Canada Post, they should be reported to God himself or whichever creator you believe, for being the antiChrist of delivery companies. I'm ashamed to have requested this as an alternate to Canada Post as the 4 day guaranteed delivery is now into the 6th day. Apparently they need to pick up deliveries in hell before coming to deliver your package."
"I went to achieve two things at the Kipling Purolator location. I returned an Amazon package which was easy enough with their QR code scan system - although after reading another review I hope my return makes it back to Amazon. Plus I had to send a package to a Canadian address. The person working pointed to a computer terminal and said I had to process my shipment there. I go to the terminal (gross...no hand sanitizer in sight) and she tells me to click on login, so I did. Then she says no, click home, which I did. Then she walked away to help someone else. I left and had an amazing customer service experience at FedEx."
"If I can give a NO STAR rating I would.I dropped off an Amazon package on June 1, between 7:10 -7:40 pm ,the guy (overly smiling) scanned the QR code, printed the label and said I was good to go.The package was never tracked, never delivered and after following up with Purolator several times, they closed the case with no help, though we gave them all the info needed, down to the time of the drop off.Very very dissatisfied, If I have an option will never choose to use this company ever again."
"I'm honestly left laughing at how ridiculously bad this company is.They don't have any information at all about how their own processes work. They don't know when packages will be ready for pickup, where they will be, if it's going to be today, tomorrow, or next week... it's all just a huge guessing game... for a logistics company, they have no grip on how a package gets from A to B.When trying to get info from them in chat, they hung up on me... just said ""I can't help you"" and ended the chat. It's hilariously bad. Shockingly. I can't even be mad since it's so ridiculous - like, I look at companies like this and wonder how they exist."
"I wouldn’t even give Purolator 1 star. Every single time I order from them there is an issue. If I dont wait at the door for the order they drive right past, never call although there is a policy to call, never leave a note. I have to waste 30 minutes at a time waiting to speak to customer service. I had to take an uber to pick up an important parcel that cost me 60$ because they wouldn’t deliver. I will REFUSE to order something when Purolator is the service."
"I will not be ordering from any company that uses Purolator, or I will request that they use a different company. I had two packages on the way from Purolator and there was  NO ATTEMPT at delivering either of them, instead they sent me a notification to go and pick up the parcels at the warehouse. How does that qualify as delivery service? I will inform the company sending the parcels as well, as they paid for a service that was not provided."
"Terrible service! They never came to our home NOR did they leave a note. We waited all day for the delivery as it was for an elderly person who really needed it. Then the comment says ""attempted delivery"" which is a total lie. I called their customer service who said they came and there was nobody home. There were two of us home ALL day. Purolator says a note was left. NOT true. And now they sent the package to Kipling which is like to say another city for us, when I specifically told Purolator I wanted to be delivered again on Monday and they assured me it would? Amazon should not be using their services if they want to keep my business."
"I honestly hate Purolator! Everytime I find out that they are going to deliver the item I purchased, I always have that bad feeling that something wrong is going to happen. In the past I had these guys deliver my product that came from British Columbia, and all of a sudden it came to Ontario and THEY SHIPPED IT BACK TO BRITISH COLUMBIA!!!! Now every time I get a product being shipped from them it ALWAYS gets delayed! Oh and what happens when I try to contact them, tracking number doesn't work, 1-2hrs holding time, they answer the phone and later hang up, and when they do answer they just don't seem to care! Next time I order anything I'm going to make sure its not Purolator!"
"If Purolator drivers left a message, I would call back. I get endless telemarketers/spam calls. If I do not recognize the number, I do not pickup. Purolator has done same thing 3 times and a friend as well. Then it is time consuming and frustrating to reschedule delivery or have to go get it. Also, the wait time by phone to speak to someone is also time consuming as to auto schedule is not user friendly.."
"they said my address was incomplete and wanted a unit/apt number which doesn't exist for my NORMAL HOUSE so i told them and they reconfirmed my address with their depot. said it would be delivered the next day. the next day comes, i get a notification it's available for pickup.Is this a joke? Is this a shipping or pickup service? I could have gone to the retail store to pick up my order instead. No other shipping courier has had a problem with my address. I am so enraged. Give me back hours of my life spent trying to get a human on the phone, okay?"
"So upset about this company. My parcel is delayed for a week... There's always a ""Delivery attempted"" status, I don't receive any phone calls and notifications. I even ask the concierge in my condo they said no parcel arrives. I called many times. The first time I waited for one hour and no one picked up the call. The second time, the staff told me my parcel would be delivered in 1-2 days, but after 2 days I still not receive it !!  I called them the third time waited half an hour still no one picked up the phone... Where is my parcel ??? Now I still waiting for them to pick up the phone. Ridiculous!"
"Purolator - you owe me $20.I visited this location, printed and affixed the shipping label on-site, and placed the package where instructed by the staff person. That was the last that I, or apparently anyone else, ever saw of it. Tracing ""specialists"" failed to turn anything up and deny any responsibility. You had one job, Purolator, and now I'm out $20. Thank goodness it wasn't $200. Never using this awful company again if I can possibly avoid it."
"Purolator’s delivery agents will falsely log an “attempted delivery - receiver unavailable”, especially if you live in an apartment building. They don’t have time to try and deliver your package. So you can either wait a few days for them to “try again” or you can request a hold on your package and go pick it up when it’s ready. Best way to avoid wasting time is to either not use Purolator, or immediately place a hold on your package. Otherwise you roll the dice on whether or not they fake delivering your package and make you wait a week. They’re probably more likely to do that during busy times."
"Seriously !!!This particular location needs to be supervised by a real manager who cares about how to treat people specially at night when those 3 unresponsible girls are dealing with people, they act just like they know that there is just ZERO accountability to call us with the F word multiple times, poor my wife and myself were about to call 911 for them less than 2 hours ago because of the way they insulted us for nothing (I mean it NOTHING we had done and someone needs to check the camera located at the top corner on October the 19th 2022 @ 8:55 pm  to verify that we had done nothing to get treated that way) we really decided not to let it go and we seriously planning to escalate it from our positions if no one contacted us."
"Not much to say here. It's the worst shipping company I have ever had to deal with. My package was on time, someone was at home all day with the wireless doorbell speaker very close, but... when I came back, there was a sticker on the front door saying no one was there! No knocking, no doorbell, nothing! It wasn't even the first time it happened when my shipment was handled by Purolator. I couldn't make it to their wearhouse sooner, and 4h before I have arrived, my package was send back to the store (customer service lady at the pick up location was very nice tho).I had one more package that was supposed to be delivered few days later. I even got an email from Purolator, about a specific day this was supposed to happen. Someone stayed at home again, to make sure I won't get another sticker... delivery guy showed up on a different day!If you have a choice and don't want to deal with extreme incompetence, pay few extra bucks and use a different company!"
"Worst courier service to deal with. Booked a package pick up 1 week ago for today and pick up time was scheduled for 10am to 2pm , i did chat and confirmed yesterday just to be sure and no one has showed up for pick up till 230pm. They have stupid chat that doesn't work. Customer service is super rude, after getting connected to someone holding line for over 30 minutes and deal with this kind of customer service.  Please use"
"Purolator lost my Amazon package and claims that they have not received it. Quite frustrating. I would never use Purolator for delivery services again. I would recommend others to avoid Purolator.Canada Post has been always great, too bad Amazon has switched to Purolator as their means for delivering and returning packages. It's very unfortunate."
"So, I paid $8 deliver fees and I have to go out of my way now to go pick up my package? Don't tell me that your delivery person ""attempted"" to deliver my package. I know for a fact my grandmother is always home she never goes anywhere since covid happened. So she is home 24/7. I really think if I'm paying for the services to get my stuff delivered, it should be delivered properly don't you think? I'm paying and wasting my money to get it delivered for no reason."
"The store where I purchased 3  bar stools used Purolator for delivery (3 boxes of 3 Kg each). This so far has been the worse experience that I ever had with a shipping company. They came to my condo the first time, without letting me know they will deliver that day. Left me a ""We missed you"" note. I called them and reschedule the delivery two days after. The packages never left the warehouse that day. Called them again and reschedule for another day. Never came to my door, and flagged me as inaccessible (they had my phone on the system and didn't even bother in calling me). Two days wasted that I had to ask permission to work from home just to wait for them and receive the packages. I can't keep wasting time on this joke. Basically I'm gonna end up paying a cab to pick up the heavy boxes THEY are supposed to be DELIVERING to me. If I could, I would give them negative stars."
"I received a text message from Purolator re. a Sim card they were to deliver: ""Picked Up: PIN...to set preferences..."" and a URL. The message is confusing. I clicked on the link and it said my item couldn't be tracked. Why was this an option if it doesn't work? I called a number at their website and after an annoying discussion with a voice simulator, I was put on hold. I hung up after almost 10 minutes. The SIM card arrived the next day."
"Awful. Every time I have used Purolator they give me the same run around. Their customer service team does, essentially, nothing. Called to get something rectified, they couldn’t do it. I asked to pick up my parcel that is sitting in their ‘distribution warehouse’ and apparently the only way to entertain that is that a request needs to be made… I am unable to simply pick up something I’ve paid for and am being penalized for their wrong doing. Interesting business model."
Hate this company literally for 3 different deliveries I had delivery attempt but no receiver available. Yet I was home for all 3 literally waiting for the packages. On 2 of them no note was left where to pick up the item either. I raised multiple complaints but this company just keeps getting worse and worse. I wish companies had delivery providers listed because if they had purolator I would never buy at a company that uses purolator for deliveries. Complete trash. Did I mention I paid more for express delivery yet had to pick the package up 2 days later myself anyway? Joke of a place. Not sure how it's run but it's a tragedy.
"We came to ship two quite large packages to one of our satellite offices. We had some difficulty with the online shipping portal to create our labels, the lovely Lashree behind the counter helped us out greatly and made the whole process go smoothly, wile at the same time receiving Amazon returns keeping the wait to a minimal for everyone!She also elegantly handled a rude customer who budded the line and stood next to me and my associate talking over us to get her attention, she kindly made aware the end of the line was on the other side of the room and didn’t even wince or acknowledge the comments the customer made wile she continued to asist us!Thanks agian to Lashree!"
"Purolator didn't deliver my package because I was made to update the job info to include my room number and buzz code, which I was fine with updating. The following day, the technician buzzed up to my buzz code and then must've proceeded to enter my building, only to not deliver the package AGAIN. I have now had to call into their dispatch THREE times for this in two days, and I still don't have my package.If you want to be a hack delivery service, we in the populous don't need you, we already have Canada Post for that.The only reason I gave you a star at all was because your dispatcher, Sean, was understanding and polite over the phone. Sean, you deserve a much better job at a much better company my friend."
"My package has been sitting in the Etobicoke sorting facility since Jan 6. When using the tracking number it says that delivery will be delayed 4-7 days due to it being oversized. When I called in, I was told that they are having a hard time getting someone to pick it up.. the product is only 51 lbs!I've opened a claim and was then told that it would be resolved by the end of the day. No updates.I don't understand the issue here. I ordered a product that is causally just hanging out at your facility for what? The last time I had something delivered through Purolator it went missing in transit. Seems like this is becoming a pattern. Such a disservice to people who rely on you to receive their products."
"I am living on the same address fie the last 15 years  and in the first attempt  the driver reported delivery attempted and in the second attempt  reported address is incorrect. I never get any order  from Purolator and I had to pick it up. I strongly believe the drivers do not take a little better orders to the building apartments, They just write what they want and make you pick them from the warehouse."
"Today Feb 22, 2022 @UPS_Canada drop parcel at my door and I was very happy but@PurolatorInc update status that customer is inaccessible, what a competency and@PurolatorInc do not want to deliver the package but@UPS_Canada did, Five star for UPS and #Zero Star for @PurolatorIncNow I have decided not order the company who uses Purolator.Really bad company. What if we have to pickup from its location why we use them. Really embarrassing. Wait whole day and at the end of day you know that the customer is not available. What to do then and where we go."
"Still waiting for a delivery that was supposed to be delivered in 3 separate occasions, according to what customer service told me in the last 3 days.  They didn't contact me on the buzzer/phone number as specified before shipping, but they came out with the excuse that I didn't have a buzzer code, which is NOT TRUE; the delivery guy could've also simply looked up my name in the building directory. Tracking information on their website is not accurate, and misleading. I understand that the delivery guy needs to make the best use of his/her time, but that doesn't entitle them to make me waste my own with false promises or excuses.If delivery doesn't arrive tomorrow (as promised for the 4th time), I'll simply return the phone to sender. Fido will also lose my business, as a consequence.I hope that Fido drops this delivery service, as this ""no buzzer"" excuse seems to be a constant from reading other reviews in Google. I don't like to be lied as a customer, so I'll definitely avoid Purolator next time."
"I had a very amazing experience at this. Purolator location. I had a package to send out in a rush. I felt a bit frustrated with myself for leaving it to the last minute. Lashree was the representative that helped me calm down and she reassured me with a very professional and warm attitude that everything was going to be ok. I normally just mail things at the post office but this was something very urgent.  Lashree was so knowledgeable of the services there and explained them so well. She was extremely quick and efficient and I was out of there in no time feeling confident and happy that I chose to go to Purolator, and grateful for Lashree!  My package arrived on time , so overall an amazing experience."
"Miscommunication on Purolator’s part led to my 2.5 hour round trip for nothing to this location. Their text message dated Wednesday last week said the item would be held here for 5 business days. That means the following Tuesday, most convenient for me, would be a safe day to pick it up. When I arrived I learned from the customer service rep at the location that my package was returned to the sender last Friday. No notice was sent to me by email or text indicating this. Posting this message here may not dissuaded people using Purolator, but hopefully someone in the company looks into their customer communication and fixes this problem before it becomes SOP.Edit: The phone number the receptionist gave me to contact the shipper was not the right one. It’s a completely different company. Purolator, why are you making my life more difficult?"
"Excuses, excuses... This is what this company is all about! I am fed up and disgusted with the way purolator operates.  There is no professionalism in this company. This is not my first experience with them, never got my first item and now I am having problems inreceiving my second item. Don't know why any supplier would recommend that they deliver anyone's parcel. Apparently you have to put a star in order to post it. But my rating is really 0.Most dissatisfied customer."
"The driver left me a notice at the door to pick up the parcel at postnet. But when I went to the postnet. I was told they never dorp the parcel there. I called down to their customer service, and been told the driver has put my parcel at another place which is 10km away from where I live. First of all they drop your package at the place which is incorrect on the notification. Secondly there is no one from purolator to notify you where the package is. You have to call them to figure out."
"Called Purolator two days ago, to have a package, which had been on-route for delivery, re-routed to my address. I spoke with Jemi (employee# 60256921) who was so very nice and helpful. She put in a request to have the package re-routed to me and then signed me up for email updates. She advised me on how to track the package and told me what to do if I saw that the package was still shipping to the original destination. Everything worked our exactly as I requested, with no further action on my part. 10* Jemi was fantastic!"
"Failed to deliver my product and says “incorrect address” even though it’s the correct address. I called to address this to make sure it wouldn’t happen again and they said it would be fine now. Sure enough on the day of delivery same issue “incorrect address” now I have to pick up the product at the warehouse because the incompetence of their delivery service. The only positive experience was the nice customer service representatives. What’s the point of being a delivery company if you can’t even deliver something to a simple house. Hell, just use google maps and you can’t fine my place, it’s not difficult."
"Super bad service by Purolator, I had missed shipment which I went to pick up at Purolator along with my IDs and Address proof and still they didn't give it to me just bcos shipment was on my wife's name. According to Purolator customer care anyone from a house with ID and the same Address can pick up the shipment but the guys at the warehouse won't listen to it. So big no to Purolator"
"My package was deliveried to the wrong address. I found it in front of the neighborhood door. I took it back, but I started to worry that they might have surveillance camera.When I contacted for a tracking enquiry, she just confirm my address without asking buzz code. I need to actively give them buzz codes.Then I asked redievery. She told me it was a delivery request and asked for anything else."
"""Attempted"" delivery. Yet they didn't ring the door bell or call my phone. Ridiculous. I called and waited 30 mins to talk to someone and asked for a re-attempt because I am pregnant and need the item asap, and would feel safer to not go into the hub (since I was home at the ""attempted"" delivery). The supervisor denied it, I guess high risk pregnant people in a pandemic is totally fine with this company."
"Ordered a phone on behalf of my father under my name, his address( so it gets delivered to him quicker, as I'm 3 hours away). They left a note on his door, without ringing the bell or knocking, for pick up 20 minutes away.  He was not able to get the package even with his ID stating the same address although if he's there on Monday for delivery he'll be able to accept the package. WHAT?! I don't even think I would be able to pick up the package as my address isn't even the same as the shipping address.The absolute worst."
"Terrible service- parcel kept moving from one sorting Center to the next and then repeated all over again.Had to call several times to figure out what was going on.Best advice is to avoid Purolator service all together!Failing that, call every day to make sure they are on the ball…."
"I wish I could give zero stars. The worst service I have ever experienced. I used express delivery service where was saying the delivery will be done the next business day. It has been one and a half week since I have been waiting for my parcel and still have not received yet. I lost all hopes to get my parcel. Customer service on the phone is useless. Customer service at the counter even worst. Parcel is at the warehouse and has been there for a week. Girl at the counter told me due to pandemic they are short of stuff but this is not my problem, in this case express delivery should be available for customers because it cost additional money. Actually this is third time I am having problems with Purolator. Never ever again with this company!"
"If I could give zero stars I would. There was NO attempted delivery. There is ZERO convenience. Just like everyone else, I now have to find a way to get to this purolator location that is completely out of my way. I don’t have a car either and I need this package before the end of the week so I can get my internet installed. Absolutely ridiculous. I will make sure to tell the company that their paying for a terrible delivery service company."
"If only there was an option for no stars.I live in an apartment and I ordered a package on amazon YESTERDAY, it was promised to be here by 9pm TODAY.The buzzer code is all there as well as my phone number. I received an email notification stating that there was an attempted delivery meanwhile I have been home all day, I did not receive a call, a buzz, a text, NOTHING. Obviously the drivers don’t do their jobs properly and they just state that they’ve delivered the packages when they haven’t.Called Customer service, my options were either redeliver - completely unpromising, and picking up, both options compromise my one day delivery and now i have to wait until Wednesday which is 4 days from now, drive 20 minutes out of my way just because they didn’t do their job properly.Purolator is notorious for this. Terrible."
"Tried to have a parcel delivered, but for some reason Purolator tried to have it returned to the sender, without any notification to me. After calling customer service and sitting on hold four separate times, I was able to have the parcel re-routed to their Kipling location for pick up.The time after that, I had a $500 air conditioner unit delivered by Purolator. I get a knock on my door and find the a/c unit on the ground with pieces spilling out of the box. The driver knocked and left quickly, so I had no opportunity to ask about why my parcel was clearly damaged. Needless to say, the a/c was broken and I had to return it.Now, I'm waiting on a parcel that should have arrived a week ago, but has been delayed due to a ""sorting error"" according to the tracking page. I guess I'll be back on the phone trying to figure out how to get my package again.If you contact Amazon customer service, you can request that they not deliver via Purolator. I wish I had known that months ago."
"I have never left a negative review for a company before but this Purolator has extremely poor service. Before I went to pick up a package for my dad I checked their website multiple times to see if I was eligible to pick up the package. Once at the location I was told that he has to come and pick up the package because ""restrictions apply"". However, these restrictions were not clearly specified anywhere, from the notice that was left at our door to their package tracking website. I tried to call them as well to confirm before going and was on hold for 30 minutes before I gave up. I can definitely relate to the 2.2 stars they have based on hundreds of reviews.EDIT: Decided to call them again after I came home and have now been waiting to speak with someone for 45 mins. I will be hanging up, and after my dad picks up his package, I hope that I will never have to deal with this extremely incompetent company again."
"0 Stars for sure. False updates on the delivery, Customer care just talks and are incapable of resolving the delivery issues on feet.My package was expected to be delivered on 18th Sep but there was no update on that. On 21 mid day seen an update that I was not available for delivery, without any signs of delivery attempt. While I was waiting for them whole day. Called them and they scheduled for another attempt today and I see an update to come and pickup the package. Called their customer care and got highly unsatisfactory answers from them. This package will never get delivered ever by them and I can bet on that.Highly unprofessional behaviour and serious lack of sense of urgency and respect for customers. If you want to save yourself from hassle do not use them ever and do not order online anything which will be delivered through them."
This is probably one of the worst courier company. The African man that came by for a pick up was very rude and had an aggressive behaviour and attitude. I would not recommend this company at all. The lady that called me from Purolator didn't care about the experience I had. She did not even apologize or showed any interest in what I had to say. These people are ridiculous. You're better off going to Canada Post.
"Any time I have had shipment from Purolator it is always delayed cause of an address issue, saying the unit number or buzzer number is not there. I have multiple invoices showing the the correct address all the time, but some how for Purolator the never have the correct address. I honestly  think they should implement a process  in place to confirm the address with the recipient or shipper before the package is out for deliver only for the driver to mark the package as invalid address. That doesn't seem efficient at all."
"One of the worse delivery companies there is. Really, Purolator, when you get paid for a certain service, shouldn't you actually ""deliver"" it? From all of my past delivery experiences, I don't remember the last time, when you actually delivered the package without hassle and complications. What is the point of you being assigned a ""delivery"" service, if your customers have to constantly pick up their packages themselves anyway. Call your service a pick up place not a delivery company. I now live in a building, your drivers constantly plaster the notifications on the outside door to the building, and it was just as bad pre-pandemic as it is now, so you have no excuse. When i lived in multiple hoses in the past, same thing, I was home, no delivery. Fix your service, it has been horrible since the very beginning of your pretend setvice. Why pay drivers and gas when you can call it a ""pick up hub"" or something. For me, this last experience have been the most painful one, I have mobility issues and live with chronic pain. With the package arriving just before Christmas I had to go pick it up myself, because you didn't bother to actually deliver it to my door, which is what you get paid for. I was in a physical agony, waiting in line outside the pick up center in the cold and then for quite some time inside. I cannot stand for prolonged periods of time. I was home all day, on the day of delivery. Your drivers constantly lie about the clients not being home because they have way too many deliveries scheduled daily ( yes I know about that, one of my acquaintances worked for your company, and I actually was considering working there at one point, until I found out how you overload your delivery workers with a ridiculous number of deliveries daily, this is no secret to anyone) I dislike leaving a bad review, I was not going to let this one slide this time because of the amount of pain it caused. Google, you should add a number ""0"" to the equasion, the company does not deserve a 1 star. Purolator, fix your service and be an actual ""delivery"" company, or change it to a ""pick-up"" company service instead. Best of luck on a big corp even paying attention to this ""little"" review."
Purolator is honestly the worst for shipping.. ordered an item 3 days ago and was told shipping would arrive today now its being delayed 4 to 7 days. Called and customer support ended up requesting a refund for it when I didn't ask for it then I had to call Amazon to tell them and they got my item back shipping again. Says delayed because its oversized.. who can't lift 47lbs im pretty sure ur job requirements are to be able to lift 50lbs but can't deliver a 47lbs item cause its too big.. ended up canceling my order cause it got delayed again another 7 days
"First they delay delivery by 4 days due to pandemic, then the attempt on a day that the road was closed even though there is another entrance to the building on the other side where the road was still open. Then on the next day they delay again due to pandemic. On the day following they claim to have attempted delivery, but I was home all day and never received a call on my buzzer and they didn't leave a note or anything. Worst delivery company I have ever dealt with. Update: I attempted to get them to allow another courier to pickup my package and deliver it to me, I figured it would be simple since they have a partnership with ups for international deliveries, but they require the sending of a fax or a hand written note for confirmation."
"I was home when the delivery person arrived, according to the time on the notice they left. But there was no knock, no phone call, no nothing. Did the delivery person just stick it on my door and leave? I've tried calling customer service several times, and gave up each time after being on hold for a half hour. Tried the live online chat and same thing. I don't have a car. The reason why I ordered this through Amazon was so it would be delivered to my house. I bought a prime account specifically for this reason. So now what do I do? Wait for the package to be returned, and buy it again, hoping Amazon will choose a different courier service? This is unbelievable."
"I received a notice at my door saying they tried to deliver a package and to pick it up here.  There was no day or time noted just this location and the hours (which were wrong hours saying it closed at 2On saturdays and closed on sundays) I made it there before 2 on Saturday As is said it closed at 2.  The guy at the counter told me it was an old slip and the package wasn’t in yet but would be In soon. I came before 4 as I learned that was the closing time.  The guy told me it wasn’t there yet and to not come in to just track my package.  I explained when I track it it says “delivery attempted, if you received a delivery attempt notice follow instructions on the notice”. Instructions say to pick up at this location.  He continued to ignore what I was saying and him and another lady said just track the package.  I asked if he could check where it was or when the truck would be back and he said that was impossible there’s way too many trucks out there to do that (although there is a route number on my slip).  It’s been 2 days now and no word of my package.  Has it just been sitting on the guys truck without being dropped off at the store? I get no answers and no help."
"Always a line up, but never unreasonable. The staff here work quick and everyone was following the social distancing rules they've implemented. They should clarify for those just dropping off a package vs picking up where to wait, but the entrance is quite small so people should just talk to one another to figure it out - be masks and social distancing kind of make it feel like we shouldn't be talking to one another though.  Either way, staff is always friendly and helpful. 5 stars"
"I wish I could give them 0 stars, 1 star is a lot more than they deserve. This business and their customer service is a disappointment at every level.Let’s start with the delivery. I was home all day expecting the package. Sometime in the afternoon I heard the bell go off and by the time I walked up to open to the door there was a missed delivery notice waiting for me. Granted I’m not as young or spry as I used to be but I’d expect the delivery person to wait 10 seconds before rushing off to disappoint the next client. Guess I’ll just wait by the door next time.But no matter, things happen. I figured I could always go pick up the package. Little did I know their delivery centre is in the Middle of nowhere. For those without cars, please take a minute and contemplate all life choices that led you to use this company, I know I did.Fast forward to next day where I manage to make my way to Narnia in order to pick up my mail. The lady at the counter was nice enough to let me know I couldn’t pick up the package as it was in my wife’s name. We don’t have same last name but live in the same house, guess that wasn’t acceptable. She was nice enough to suggest I come back again with my wife to vouch for the package. Upon which she proceeded to let me know they were open till 4 on Saturday.So here I am, back again at 3 pm on a Saturday with an angry wife in tow. Only to discover their office shuts at 2. I don’t know if the woman was misinformed or just malicious. In retrospect I should have double checked the hours instead of taking the word of a purolator employee. I don’t think they can be expected to know such trivial details as hours of operations.Either way, don’t use Purolator. You’re better off using literally anyone. Even your drunken cousin who can’t tie his shoes laces is more competent and reliable than these geniuses."
"the absolute worst service. I was expecting an important package specifically for today and waited at home all day, around 3pm i check the status and it said attempt was made to deliver....how?!!? no one knocked, called or even left a door tag.I called their service help line they tell me once the truck is back i'll be able pick it up at their office.....4 hrs go by i call back and then they say the package wont be available for pick up until the next day. No wonder they are rated so low they need basic re-training in every department, highly recommend using anyone but these guys for your shipping."
"The woman who helped us at the counter is the reason this is more than a 1~2 stars. She was lovely and did her best even if she couldn't help us! So we appreciate it. I'll change my review if the actions of delivery folk don't represent this location, though. I'm ticked off but I don't want to blame the wrong people!But we were supposed to get a package sometime in the week. We left our house to go out Sunday at 8pm. When we arrived home shortly after we had a 'sorry we missed you' stating they showed up at 8:15 AT NIGHT. On a Sunday! We were really ticked off (we had stayed home all week trying to catch it so we didn't have to play package tag haha). The notice said we could come here to get our package anytime after 10am the following day. So we head out around 1pm (just in case they needed a few extra hours, you never know) and have to drive to ANOTHER CITY to get it. It was super confusing to actually find Purolator on this lot, and when we arrived the poor woman had to search for our package only to tell us it was off in a warehouse somewhere and not actually there and they would redeliver it the next day.Needless to say, we drove home after going there for nothing, and they didn't deliver it the next day anyways. I don't mind waiting for stuff, but the delivery people really should communicate better with the other staff or something. It was a messy situation, and seems to always happen with these kind of things."
"I will never use Purolator again. They said they tried to deliver, but never came to my house, THEN I was told that I could only pick it up from their hub (I live west end Toronto and had to go to middle of Etobicoke 1hr by transit) where I was told that the package was in the building behind the one I was in and no one could bring it across the parking lot for 1.5 hours, and they still took an extra 20 min on that. The customer service rep gave me attitude the whole time too, like I was unreasonable for being told that it would take 1.5 hours to get my package from a building 20 meters (400ish feet away). She even asked me if I wanted an apology from the guy who brought it across the parking lot."
"Delivery nightmare, instead of me getting my very important documents safely delivered to me, instead I was running after and chasing down my package, lots of miscommunication within the company. To start off the driver attempted delivery to my neighbor house (WRONG ADDRESS), then after was told to pick up at this location which is a long way, just to find out it was not here. After spending hours on the phone tracking the package, finally was told it was at a different pickup location. I have lost all faith in purolators service in delivering your important packages. It is unreliable, reckless, their drivers need a basic training to check the address."
"customer service is absolute garbage. my package has been missing for almost two weeks with no explanation. the tracking history shows that the package could not be delivered because the business was closed, but we are not a business; we are a single family dwelling that clearly looks like a house. no note or ticket was left on the door or in the mailbox so clearly no delivery attempt was made. two case numbers and two weeks later, Purolator is 'looking into it' with no clear answers and no path towards resolution."
"If I could give a 0, I would.Travelled an hour to pick up my package, but their ""3rd party"" driver never took it out of his truck. Then it was ""oh, we have a guy trying to find it in the warehouse, there's 1000 pieces in there.""When I asked what the ETA was (at this point, I had waited 30 mins already), the service guy responded with ""oh, you're in a rush, eh?"" No, but what does your inventory system look like?!Then I was given a sheet to fill out, sign, and put on my front door that gives the Purolator driver permission to leave my package at my door. It was nice of him to offer me a piece of tape to do so. Then I was told to wait another 5 minutes because the warehouse guy was going to call back. Nope, can't find it. Told service worker there's no way I'm coming back to get it.Waiting for this Purolator location to call me back to tell me that they've found it. Or something."
"Just awful. Received an email notification saying they can’t deliver without a unit number. The number was right there clear as day so I don’t know what they were looking at! Had to call and be placed on hold forever. No apologies, nothing. Also can’t accommodate a delivery without a “note on the door” during work hours. I clearly just gave permission on the phone to just leave the package so I don’t have to go out of my way to pick it up when it’s supposed to be delivered a day ago. They don’t care about customers."
I wish i can give zero stars on this but i think one star is fair enough. Received a delivery slip without a pickup date and i went to the facility thinking it was there at the end of the business day. The employee told me to come in the next day (Sat) where she said i would be available but a different employee said it hasn't arrived and told me to come back Monday. I think this is a big inconvenience coming in just getting false info and just travelling back and forth. It makes sense that there are a lot of bad reviews against this company. Its a shame.
"Awful customer service experience. I drove all the way to the shipping centre to pick up a package in which I received a notice. I forgot the slip that was given to me, and automatically was dismissed by Purolator staff. Usually with Canada Post, they just take my ID and see what packages they have under my name. But at Purolator, the woman refused to take my ID and search for my package and insisted I go on my phone and find a specific tracking number to give to her, then again dismissed me. I have multiple separate orders I'm expecting to arrive through Purolator to which have different tracking numbers. So the fact that they asked me for a specific tracking number for a mystery package out of the multiple I ordered is completely unreasonable and a waste of both my time and the employee's time. I was just outraged by the lack of help and the attitude given by the Purolator staff. Hopefully Canada Post can take back my business as they are definitely the dominant shipper in terms of customer service. Thanks for wasting my time and effort to get nothing out of it. I will personally ensure that I no longer have packages going through to Purolator as a result of this outrageous customer support."
"Worst delivery carrier ever. These people do not bother to dial number at buzzer entry system. Such systems are present at the entrance of all apartments/condos but I am not sure where they hire their employees.Their delivery agent won't even call you for it , they simply leave a note that receiver was missing and ask you to collect from their warehouse.If you ever want to use this service then I would recommend you to directly go to the shop and buy your item, there are 99% chances that the item will get your home by you earlier than getting delivered by Purolator."
"Terrible, non-existent service, probably the worst courier and delivery service currently available in Canada. It doesn't matter whether you're at home, if all the the information provided, Purolator will find a way to screw it up. The delivery service is awful, the unfortunate time where the merchant had to ship products using Purolator not even once it was delivered or a genuine attempt is made to deliver. Purolator brings headache and stress instead of parcels and makes no attempt at redeeming themselves. Best case scenario is when when they dump your package on the other side of the city, because in this scenario they at least didn't loose it. If there is away to avoid this terrible company, please do so. I wish big merchants like Amazon, Hudson Bay or Best Buy would drop this service in favour of someone who actually works"
"Well, this was the worst.Tracking said the package was delayed- then magically they tried to deliver the same day it was delayed. Ahead of schedule- you'd think this would be great, but it just creates hoops to jump through.No physical notification of the delivery attempt (just an email from a different carrier in the US at 3:40am saying it was a failed delivery attempt and I had to schedule a delivery time).You'd think that would be easy- but no. Not available for when I'm home, but for another day when I'm not.Or hey, I can do the job for them (that I paid for) and pick up- oh, but there's only ONE location for the GTA, and that's over an hour away from me, each way.This has been the worst delivery service I've had to deal with."
Was waste of time going to collect parcel prulator location almost 30 mins drive(one way) from my place. Representative said sorry though it is in warehouse still we can not give it to you as it is set for delivery tomorrow and you can expect at home.I explained all will be at work tomorrow and there won't be anyone that's why I came to pick and it says on tracker available for pick up.Just a robotic answer no sir we can not pls call customer care number (they have 2 hr waiting).Had to return empty and today took day off to recieve parcel.Where is customer service here?
Hate it when Amazon uses this company. No problem when Amazon themselves deliver or Canada Post. If you live in an apartment building regardless you give them the buzzer number no note left no buzz and then when I call them they say will take a few days before I can pick up?? So told Amazon the amount I order from you please don’t use them for my delivery. If you order from Amazon call Amazon and they can have them as your least preferred carrier option.
First they updated a pkg delivery from yesterday to today. I was home all day. No one buzzed me. No one called. Now i have to oick my pkg up far away when there are canada post locations nearby. There waa a huge sign at the lobby that said to leave it at the lobby. Even more fun is trying to get through to call. Better know their hours first cuz the machine won't inform you and will keep you waiting all night. I almost want to change supplies just to avoid fhe hassle with Purolator
"Ordered from Amazon on the Thursday of Thanksgiving weekend for ONE DAY GUARANTEED DELIVERY… so, Friday delivery. Was tracking the package online all day Friday, (package was put on the truck at 11:00 a.m.). At 7:15 p.m., the tracking notice says that there is a “delivery delay” and that they “might be later than expected"", but essentially that it will be there ASAP. Checking back after 8 p.m. it says that they cannot deliver until the next business day. Problem is, because Purolator is owned by Canada Post, this means that they do not deliver on weekends or holidays. This now means that my package is not going to be delivered until today, Tuesday… Which is a 5 DAY DELIVERY, not a GUARANTEED one day delivery. I needed this item for Saturday, so Tuesday delivery wasn't cutting it. Go back on Amazon on Friday night,  order the same item again, again for guaranteed one day delivery, being Saturday. Cancel this order that's arriving too late. Get second package no problems on Saturday (thanks FedEx!), and Purolator delivered the first package today (actually knocked on my door!?). Now, I had to schlep this cancelled package to the UPS outlet to return to get my money back. I'm going to place future Amazon (and others) orders that will guarantee Purolator is NOT the one to deliver. What a disgrace."
"My package has been at this location for 3 days, they missplaced my package. I live close to this location but they're taking forever to deliver the item i had ordered i called them to make a pickup for the package but they've been stalling me for 2 days saying itll be ready tomrrow. I dont really understand what the workers are doing, but i really dont want to be rude because they are working during a pandemic but this is hectic, at least tell me why its taking so long."
"Purolator has to be the worst delivery company of all time. They fall short with their services, and they’re customer service is disgusting. I’ve been put on hold for several hours, and when agents were incompetent of doing their job they would even hang up on me. If I could give them a 0 star rating, that is what they would get. A package was supposed to be delivered on Tuesday, and I am still waiting. An agent advised me that it was confirmed to be here on Thursday, and when that obviously didn’t happen I was told they need to find my package. How did a television go missing?"
"When it came to customer service, Purolator was excellent. The curbside pickup service worked flawlessly and it took no time at all to get my package. What was a bit more difficult was finding the exact location. I came from the north of the location since I figure it would be easier to make a right turn into the location instead of coming up from the south and having to make a left. The signage for 800 Kipling was clear and I turned in okay but the signage for the Purolator location wasn't clear enough. I finally spotted a small sign on the security building which said ""Purlolator at south end"" but it was small and not at all easy to spot. After seeing the sign, I headed south through the parking lot and found it no problem. On the way out, I headed south and the signage for Purolator is much better and clearer from that direction so the ease of finding the location is highly dependent on which direction (north or south) that you come from."
"The lady at the shipping and receiving counter was very nice. She helped me tape my package and reminded me to copy down the tracking number as well.Honestly, this location or at least the service they provide here should be rated much higher.  If people actually read the reviews, it’s all about the drivers. Yes, the drivers are probably from this location, but hands down the actual service counter.....A+!"
"> STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY < This must be, by far, the worst deliver company I've ever deal with my entire life! It's not the first time that they ""attempt"" to deliver a parcel, without knocking on the door or doing anything at all to actually try to deliver your parcel. They just say ""you were not there to receive the package"" and didn't even leave a delivery notice. Come on! What else do you expect, that we leave the door wide open with a breakfast on the table for the driver? This is a joke, Purolator. Please don't be so disrespectful with your customers!!! People, please find another delivery company to handle your parcels, no one deserves what this company is doing."
Not a great delivery service. They have a tendency not to listen to you as to what you want but more so as to what they want which is just to deliver their packages delete Parcels in hallways out in front of your door putting them at risk in terms of theft and then have the nerve to send you photographs of the packages in front of the door showing that they delivered them. My inclination is to perhaps show them a picture of my door with the package missing and ask them what happened to it. If you going to use the service please insist on them not leaving packages unattended. They also don't use door codes and sneak into the lobby to do the . I'm not pleased with this kind of behaviour so insist on your witches being attended to. After all you're paying for it.
"Was told by Service Ontario Call Center to use Purolator as a courier to deliver some papers to  a Government Office located in North Bay , Ontario , as the person mentioned that Purolator is their official courier. Anyway went to the location at Kipling Avenue to ship papers on June 27, 2019. Walked in and it looked like a ghost town. Approached the counter and asked the person behind it how long it takes to deliver some papers to North Bay, Ontario. She said, let me check. After checking she told me that there’s Next Day Delivery. I said Ok then I asked for forms to fill out. She said there’s no forms but she can do it for me in the computer. That was surprisingly odd but anyway I gave her my driver’s licence and the address to where was being shipped including postal code. She printed out shipping label and I noticed that postal code to the destination was wrong. She said that the system doesn’t allow her to put the postal code that was written in government papers and said that the system corrected it automatically. She insisted that the postal code that I originally gave was for Canada Post to use for P.O Box and the one that system shows is the correct one. I asked again to make sure that there is no mistake and she assured me that the package will be delivered. I agreed since I didn’t have much choice and paid for the service and left. Checked online the next day the status of the shipment and there was no information at all indicating that the shipment was delivered or whatever happened to it. On June 29, 2019 the system showed that the shipment is in Winnipeg, MB. Then there’s July 1, 2019 which is a holiday. And hopefully will be delivered July 2, 2019. Thanks so much for promising next day delivery, liars!  Never had that experience with UPS.  I highly recommend UPS"
"I had shipped a custom table, made a wooden frame to protect it, wrapped it in moving blankets and covered it with corrugated cardboard. The custom table is built with solid walnut and maple. I paid for insurance coverage for $1500 .My customer got the table but with the legs damaged. This is all during covid and I got the run around for 3 weeks before the ""right person"" took my case to even look at it. This is because they dont get too many claims over $500, is what I was told by one of the ladies at the claims department. ""Sir we usually get back in 24 hours but due to COVID we are just catching up to your file, this is the first time I'm seeing it so please be patient"" What a nightmare. From the very start they kept passing the blame to the previous person who took the call.  The first person messed up the documentation in the system. Off course after sending pictures and explanation and everything else they wanted, they mentioned we hadn't packed the table properly. As a custom furniture maker and designer, this was packaged solid, except for if the package was thrown around. Poor customer service, poor handling of merchandise and putting the blame on the customer is pretty much norm. If you want to save some money DO NOT buy insurance from them as you'll NEVER get any money as they will NEVER take responsibility of their mishandling. Customer is always wrong and guilty until proven innocent seems to be the modus operandi."
Had to come down here after my mother missed a package. Drive home after 3 hours and find out that I missed my own package. Had to find out through my email because there was no delivery notice left outside. Had I been left a notice I would have been able to pick up my own at the same time since it arrived back at the facility while I was still in the area. Now I have to make another hour of travel tomorrow morning. GREAT
"I don't know what changed, but before when Purolator wants to be lazy at least they had the courtesy to drop off a slip and lie about attempted delivery. Now you can't even spare the effort to at least driving by to leave a slip and instead just claims clients giving the ""wrong address"". there's no worse feeling than being notified that Purolator is your courier, nowadays it's like a gamble to have stuff delivered because you might get Purolator."
All-day I waited at home and worked from my front room so I can see when the Purolator truck stops at home to avoid any missed deliveries. I find out at 4 PM that somehow a delivery attempt was made. I check my cameras to see if any trucks came by. The only truck that passed by was a FedEx truck.I spoke to customer service and they said no one was home as per their driver and that they left a notice. Come to find out that it was left at someone else's address in another city in the GTA. The person was extremely nice enough to bring the notice and package to the pick-up location in which then I got a call from the pick-up location stating what happened.Due to the COVID-19 restrictions and the fact that my city is on lockdown. I'm extremely frustrated that I now have to go out to a place which I never intended to go to thanks to the negligence of Purolator.
"Why would anyone ever even use this service. My package was attempted to be delivered yesterday I got a notice on my door that it would be ready for pickup today at 10 am. I went to the location after 10 am and they tell me that the driver has not left the package and is going to attempt to deliver it again.  I got back home and have been waiting for the package but 6:42 a message on the tracking number comes up and guess what it is postponed till the ""next day"" which is not saturday but monday. If this driver just left the package at the depot this wouldnt be a problem. How does someone not keep track of what they have attempted to deliver and now makes everything more difficult for their company and for the consumer. If i ever have a choice I will never choose purolator for anything."
"I took a whole day off work just to be home so I could get my package, and suddenly I see it online that red ""Attention"" on Purolator website saying that the package is ""Available for pickup for 5 business days from arrival date at the counter."" 1st - What counter? I have to call to ask? Why can't you just put the address there? 2nd - I ordered to come to my house, not to some warehouse in Kipling 40 minutes away from where it was supposed to be!The driver, AGAIN (yes. it is not the first time), did not even try to deliver it. There is no note whatsoever in the lobby of the building saying anything. If I haven't looked at the tracking number online I would have never knew that the delivery was ""attempted"", even less where it was. Total scam. What kind of service is this Purolator?Hey management, can't you see the reviews? 2.1 is pretty embarrassing is it not? Do you really think people and companies will want to use Purolator over other much more reliable delivery services? Do something about it!"
"I echo a lot of the statement here... among the big delivery companies, I've had the most issues with Purolator.  Most recently, they arrived to deliver a package at my apartment, but because the buzzer code wasn't included in the address (who does that?!) they went away. They didn't even attempt to dial up from the phone in the lobby like EVERY other delivery company (incl Pizza Pizza) does.My last delivery they left it with the Mgmt company in my building he didn't leave a note that they'd delivered it.  When I looked it up online is showed delivered.  I called and they promised to have someone call me but they NEVER did. I followed up twice and got the same run-around, until I finally figured out on my own what they did.Too bad you can't select delivery companies when you order online. I would certainly never use them myself."
"Always disappointed with Purolator service. Despite living in a condo building with a concierge desk, they manage to miss a guaranteed delivery date two days in a row. They marked the shipment as ""delivered"" so Amazon thinks everything is okay. I have to go pick up the heavy package myself and drive it myself. They should have ""cheaper"" warehouse pickup rates if they cannot make guaranteed delivery dates.  Purolator didn't even leave a notification card telling me where the item was available for pickup.This is an ongoing issue with Purolator, while CanadaPost always seems to delivery on time and has even called if I was not home.Online retailers, please please please stop using Purolator. From now on, it will be my last resort even if there is a significant price variance on my order."
"First they delivered my package to the wrong address. I called them because the tracker online said they brought it to the incorrect postal code. Fixed the address with them. Waited a couple days and nothing came. Had to send the address to them again. Then there was trouble scanning the parcel to send it back out for delivery. Long story short, I had to drive all the way out to Etobicoke because they couldn't figure out what was going on with the address... It felt very unorganized. I would not recommend this company to anyone who expects organization, timely drop-offs, and reliability."
"I am so completely fed up with Purolator.Like almost every other review here, multiple times I’ve not been buzzed nor have notices been left. Yesterday was the final straw.I was expecting some medication to be delivered and I chose Purolator as there are currently Canada Post disruptions. I even paid twice as much as what Canada Post would have been. And imagine that - an “attempted delivery” without my being buzzed to be let in and no notice left.I had already complained twice in the past few months alone to their social media reps and each time was given the “we have forwarded your concern to local management”. Last night, aka Friday, I started my complaint the exact same way. Their resolution? “We can have it delivered on Tuesday”I stated that wasn’t good enough because of the urgency of the package and that I will just pick it up at the depot on Kipling. They actually had the gall to say to me, “Does your notice say the package is ready to be picked up?” meaning they did not even read my original complaint where I said no notice was left. I forwarded screenshots of my previous complaints and it took them about an hour to respond with “We have let local management know and you can pick your package up.”I am letting my supplier know to no longer do business with Purolator as they do not give an iota of s*** if your package is time sensitive. The courier’s only job is to attempt to deliver a package but it seems as though they leave the depot and do everything but what their job entails. #youhadonejob"
"Terrible company to ship with. I paid for Express post to courier a document from Whitby, Ontario to Queen Street West in Toronto.I dropped it off on a Friday at about 12:00pm; the guaranteed delivery time was for Monday by end of the business day.Not only did they fail to meet that time frame, but they also have lost my parcel. After numerous calls they finally located my item and have given me an additional delivery date...which has passed and again they failed to meet.I tried to use the Live Chat option to talk with a customer service rep to find out more information. Extremely unhelpful and rude.They have had the parcel for a total of 6 Business days (8 calendar days) and have still not delivered my item."
Every time I see that a company I order from has shipped through Purolator I already anticipate the struggle it will be to get my package. Every other courier in this city seems to get into my apartment building fine but I don't ever get a slip or its obvious the driver didn't even try. The front desk is available to let them in. I am also home when my packages are trying to be delivered and I end up having to transit over an hour away to pick it up myself. It is very inconvenient for an individual who does not drive to go to an industrial area in the city to pick up expensive parcels. If I could I would pay extra on websites I order from not to ship with Purolator but sometimes courier is not mentioned in shipping costs.... Such a terrible courier service.
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!I have never left a review before as I tend to be the kind of person who shrugs things off as long as it gets done. This however is an exception. I order a package from amazon that was SUPPOSED to arrive BY 8:00PM June 5th. this package is very important and I needed it to arrive ASAP. I was waiting at home today and used my laptop to keep track of my package. no one walked in or our of my condo from 12:00pm-7:00pm. at 6:30 I refreshed my page to a notification that said my package delivery has been attempted. This was a shock to me so I called the customer service number for Purolator and told the Purolator customer service person (Jackson) my situation. All he said to me was that the delivery was attempted and that he could call me before 8:00pm and tell me when the delivery truck would be at the warehouse so that I could pick up my package from there. as that sounded like the only way I was going to get my package today I agreed. at 8:15pm I drove over to the warehouse using the address that was given AND without a phone call (seems to me Purolator's customer service reflects their delivery system). Once I arrived at the warehouse I explained my situation again to the employee and all the employee did was blame the other employee (Jackson). the employee told me that there was no way that I would be getting my package when they said they would. so when I asked what I could do he scribbled on a piece of paper and told me to come back tomorrow at 8:00pm and my package ""should"" be at the warehouse so that I can pick it up. I then walked out and looked at the paper I was handed and it had scribbles. furious, I went back into the warehouse and asked what was supposed to be on the note. the employee laughed and apologized and rewrote a number I could call. he then looked up at his computer and told me "" by the way you were right the delivery wasn't even attempted"". I asked him why I paid a delivery company to deliver my important package and they didn't even attempt to deliver it and now I have to go to the warehouse to pick it up and bring it back with me. this statement was followed by a shrug of the shoulders. I have used many delivery companies and this is my first AND MY LAST time using Purolator. The only reason I gave this disgrace of a delivery company a one star is because I had to in order to leave a review. if you are thinking about using this company PLEASE DONT. YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR PACKAGE."
I am very disappointed with the service. I ordered my laptop from Dell on December 23. It came to etobicoke depot on Jan 6th and then status showed address correction needed(it appear extra hyphen in postal code rest address is correct). Not sure where it went wrong as in my dell invoice my address is showing correct. I noticed this on Jan 14th and resolved the issue. Then I called again on Jan 18th to check the status and when this will be delivered agent mentioned that they have to create a case and it was mentioned the priority as I wanted this to deliver at the earliest.  I didn't get that laptop till 22nd then again I called to check and I got the mail asking my address again. I had given the address 3 times by now. And today is 25th no status update on the website. It still shows address correction needed. This is really frustating.
"I ordered a package through Amazon, and Purolator was the shipper the sender picked. Purolator failed to deliver the item to my door, and then lied and updated the package on Amazon as 'delivered.' I then get an automated call from Purolator saying that I can pick up my package, but get this, I have to go all the way to Etobicoke AND they will only hold my package for 2 days. I was extremely busy and didn't have 2 hours to travel there in those 2 days to pick up the item so I'm out of luck.Since they lied to Amazon about delivering the item I can't get a refund through Amazon at all.Bottom line is, I lost my shipment and can't get a refund. Terrible service."
"Purolator routinely leaves delivery notices in my lobby without ever buzzing my apartment to check if I'm home, and then the packages get sent to depot nearly 20km away despite the fact that they have a depot less than 5km from where I live, and multiple smaller locations less than 2km away.I don't have a car, which is why I'm having a package delivered. If i have to spend 3 hours making a 40km round trip on public transit anyway, what the hell is the point of delivery? Purolator is easily the worst shipping company in this country."
"Terrible customer service! Showed up pick up a package a couple minutes after closing. An employee came outside and I asked if I could pick up a package. She began to scream at me that they were closed. I tried to explain that I wasn't sure since the pick up note I received stated the location was open till 9pm. However she continued to shout and scream at me saying that they were closed. My issue is not with them being closed, my issue is the way that employee yelled at me. Terrible!"
"I'm compelled to write a review even though I don't normally do so, because of my bad experience with this company. I ordered online and waited for the the item, that I even tracked. I live in an apartment so delivery people usually buzz in . On the day expected, the phone never rung and yet when I went down to check, I saw a notice posted on the wall that no one was home. WTH! I called customer service and told them in no way will I go all the way  to Kipling just to pick up my item. The customer service staff said that she'll just have my package sent to the nearest station, which turned out to be a mobile phone and repair store in Eglinton. Then, the company I ordered from mistakenly sent a duplicate of the item I ordered, so that I have to deal with Purolator again. This time, the phone did ring at exactly at 2:05 PM, my son answered it and press the number to open the apartment lobby door for the driver. We both waited but there was no knock on the door. I asked my son if the driver ever said we were supposed to go down to pick up the item ourselves but he said nada. When we did go down and check,  guess what we found. A notice  that the driver was there at 1:50 PM and that no one was home. What a liar! I called customer service again. The person I talked to this time seemed less concerned nor sympathetic and asked me brusquely if I wanted it redelivered again or just sent to the nearby station again. I said don't bother. I'm sure the driver will lie again. Then I called the company I ordered from and told them that I will never order from them again as long as they deal with Purolator. You order online for the convenience. But with Purolator, you get nothing but stress!"
"Quick, efficient service. Never waited more than 5 minutes for a parcel. Lots of parking, courteous staff, convenient hours.Have been able to pick up a parcel in the evening when the driver has attempted delivery earlier in the day. Can't do that with UPS!"
"This is without a doubt THE WORST COMPANY I ever dealt with. I'm flabbergasted they're still in business. Every single time I get a package delivered by them I get the same issue: a note by my door suggesting to go to their depot in the middle of nowhere. No chance of getting a heads-up by the driver, no way of scheduling anything, no way of dropping it with the freaking neighbor even! It's ""we'll drop it at some point and you better be there and see us, or we'll get rid of your stuff in a few days"". I NEVER have this kind of problems with FedEX, UPS or any other company of this nature (and I do get packages all the time).Next time I shop online I'm going to inquire what delivery company they use, and if I hear they use Purolator I'll let them know that I'm not shopping there because getting my merchandise will be a nightmare.So Purolator social media guy, don't even bother, I know you have the worst job in the world trying to excuse the inexcusable, let's not pretend they give a damn about customer service. The last time I spoke to someone on the phone she had to admit they were the worst at what they do. That should tell you enough.Now I guess I'll go see if I can for the life of me decipher what the hell the driver wrote in this delivery note. Another tip for the future: Puroguys, start by hiring people that are not illiterate.  I really really really hope I never ever in a million years have to deal with you again.Good job."
"If I can leave a no star rating i would, but unfortunately I can only leave a one star. Worst courier service. Driver 'apparently attempted a delivery' was sitting 2 feet from the door. No knock or door bell. Was scheduled for redelivery on Monday. Package never showed. Waiting on Tuesday. That 2 days off from Work for this package. And they expect me. To sit waiting 8am-6pm. These people are the worst. Manager gave me assurance to give me a call Personally to let me know when  it'll Arrive so I don't have to sit around all day. Yet I got no call. I will NEVER SHIP OR RECEIVE FROM THIS COMPANY."
"Like the other reviews on here, no delivery attempt was made.  They didnt even leave a notice card in my mail slot or on my door.  I was only notified via email that they ""attempted"" delivery and no one was home.  My wife was waiting at home all day for the package.We ordered this on a 2 day delivery.  Was supposed to arrive on Friday but they dropped the ball and it was not flown out from Vancouver, BC.  Arrived on Monday and got notice on a fake delivery attempt.  Im picking this up on a Tuesday now because im not gonna risk another fake delivery attempt.  4 day transit for a 2 day delivery service.......The reviews are accurate, these guys need to get their act together and deliver on their service agreements.  Habitual ball droppers."
"As per EVERY OTHER REVIEW, I was home and nobody attempted any sort of delivery. Package is now an hour drive away from my place and I have to go waste a morning picking it up. Only ship with these dinguses if you expect your clients to enjoy not getting things delivered directly to their home/workplace. Literally every other delivery service that exists today can accomplish this task. Canada Post is 110% more reliable even on when they are on strike. There should be a zero star review option. Thanks for nothing Purolator!"
"The courier stated twice that the address was not correct.  I called the office once and confirmed my address and it was correct.  The courier had my telephone number and the second time he found that the address was not correct and he did not deliver the package.  Whenever Purolator is to deliver me a package, it is the same.  Terrible service and the driver may first go to school to understand the instructions correctly.  Awful !!!!"
0 stars. Purolator is absolutely the worst delivery company. I can see by the 2 star average rating that they are not addressing any issues to better their incompetence. I just want my package. It was here and they took it away. Faaaaaaaaar away. And no other delivery company does that. I will never be using this company again and will never recommend it to anyone ever.Edit: THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT.
"For ALL AMAZON CUSTOMERS!You can call Amazon customer service and ask them to not use Purolator when they ship packages. It's something they are more then willing to do for you. I just did and it already feels great to know I won't have to even deal with them again!They never make even the slight effort of trying to get you your package, door bells scare them, intercom systems scare them, even just a regular door scares them. It's not a hard job, but it's apparently hard to do well. I am thankful for all the delivery drivers working during this hard times but only for the ones actually working"
"I generally never give any negative feedback to any business but Purolator is special case. 90% times I had to personally go and pickup package myself from provided Purolator location. Instead of notifying through email, they leave the note on main door of the apartment building which many times gets removed by passerby’s. Also, they hardly delivered the package to our door sighting some weird reason. Even I asked Amazon NOT to ship anything with Purolator. Also, it takes ages to speak to someone on customer service !! You have to either lose your package or it will be sent to shipper back !!!"
"Management of Purolator,Your company does not care about good customer service or experience.I live in an apartment block. My ISP shipped a package using your service and the delivery man never rang me to see if I was home and just left a note. I was in my apartment at the time and provided my phone number. I could have been down to collect in 1 minute. In the end I had to travel 1 hr by public transport to pick up my package at 800 Kipling where I was told drivers dont have phones to contact people. How is delivery supposed to work in that case? Reading the reviews this happens to others also.I've also had the unpleasant experience of trying to use your tracking system.Yesterday the latest message read ""Address correction required - Incomplete/incorrect address provided"". A Contact Us link was provided which I used. I used the Chat online support agent who kindly took my address and requested the access code. They said it would be delivered the following day. I checked the tracking system and it now said ""Shipment scheduled for next business day"".I was happy, they set my expectations high. However today I checked again and the status was back to incorrect address provided. I made every attempt to contact support but everything was offline - not even a telephone hold queue. Nothing. No way to contact.I decided I just wanted my delivery so spent an hour each way on the subway to pickup my package. The staff were rude in 800 Kipling and clearly didnt care at all about me or anyone else who were customers.I will also be lodging a complaint with my internet provider in the hope they will no longer use your services.Matt"
"Really unfortunate experience. I was initially supposed to receive my package anywhere from the 26th to the 30th. I didn't, due to a ""missed delivery"" which was supposed to be reschueld for the next business day. Which again, I didn't receive within those two following business days. Then they attempt to deliver my package on the weekend, which isn't expected and I'm not home and I'm working. Granted, I realize it can be busy during the holiday, however I don't expect my package to be sent to a a shipping Centre in etobicoke that's over an hour away from where I live and now I'm expected to pickup said package, at said location within the next 5 business days. I don't understand the logic. I just want my package delivered to my home, like I asked. I understand if it's MY fault IF I missed the delivery but that's not the case. The Purolator courier missed the window in which they were supposed to deliver my package. And now it's my responsibility to pick up my package after paying for the delivery service? Absolutely unacceptable. I just want my package delievered to my home at this point. I am not making the 1 hour commute to etobicoke from my location to pick up something that was supposed to be delivered to me."
I was supposed to receive a package yesterday but I didn't receive it. When i checked the tracking information it said that a buzzer code was required? Considering I live in a condominium with 24 hour concierge service you would think the driver would drop it off with the concierge just like all the other courier companies.Update: I was on hold with customer service for 22 only to hear someone sigh and hang up on me. Still on hold trying to speak to someome
"Negligent and incompetent service!0 Stars rating if that was an option.I had a guaranteed delivery date and time for a package was addressed to the Etobicoke Depot and was marked to be picked up.  The package somehow made it onto a truck to go out for delivery (to where… I don’t know) and customer service couldn’t explain how it happened and where it was going.  To add insult to injury, Purolator denied the claim for a refund citing it was delivered on time."
"Delivery attempt with no notice given (Thursday, roughly 2 pm). Called twice to figure out how to get my package and my options were to either travel 11km to their sorting facility in Etobicoke or wait until Monday to get my package from a closer facility.Given that I don’t have a vehicle, the first option is not reasonable unless I’m going to pay for a very expensive cab or Uber. Not to mention this totally defeats the purpose of the delivery service itself.The second option is also unreasonable. It shouldn’t take 4 days for me to be able to pick up my package from a facility near me. The items are time sensitive and once again, this defeats the purpose of paying for the delivery itself.Very poor business model and I hope I never have to deal with puralator again. Offer shorter turnaround times like Canada Post does."
"If you can help it, avoid Purolator as a shipping service altogether. Two weeks of back and forth and my package still has yet to be in my hands. After having asked to have my package delivered to the nearest Purolator office to me (which was confirmed by the representative to be 800 Kipling) I expected this ordeal to be over. Yet after arriving to pick up my parcel, I was told that it was not at this location (much to my dismay but certainly not to my surprise). The representative with whom I spoke could not confirm the location of my parcel or its hours.Leave it to Purolator to take longer to deliver a package to its recipient than it takes to ship the parcel from a warehouse overseas to Canada."
"I will never order from Best Buy again now that I know they use Purolator. I never have issues with Canada Post, UPS, or Fedex but Purolator are so ridiculously incompetent I am at a loss for words.I ordered a TV from Best Buy Canada, was alerted that it would arrive as early as January 14th. To my surprise, they attempted a delivery on the 11th, did NOT knock on my door (multiple people were home, no one heard anything) and left me two notices they were at the depot. What?!?!I called the depot near Kipling and requested a redelivery - to my surprise, the gent I spoke with on my phone finds my tracking number but goes ""oh, that's so strange - it looks like a label was never made for your order, that's weird!""... doesn't exactly give me confidence that my expensive shipment is in good hands. He then reassured me that he would set up a redelivery for either the 14th or 15th, and provide instructions to knock loudly, since I do not have a doorbell.I advise my roommates to please listen for the door, even leave multiple notes on my door to knock loudly - sure enough, I call them when I'm at work, and STILL nothing.I call the depot ONCE AGAIN and speak to a very nice lady who informed me that the redelivery request was made, but was never processed?!?! It was still sitting at the depot. She was kind and helpful enough to arrange for yet ANOTHER redelivery - but looks like I'm gonna be holding my breath until I actually get my TV. The sheer incompetence of both the driver and the original person that ""helped me"" is astounding. I will NEVER order something again if I notice it will be shipped with purolator - it has been nothing but headaches. I am convinced that they don't even knock or attempt to get in contact for delivery - and just stick those things on your door. So so so unhappy and irritated - I NEVER write negative reviews for anything but I am appalled by how brutal their service is - and after reading all these reviews I see I'm not alone.DON'T use purolator if you can avoid it - stick with another mail courier service."
"Delivery guy came once.. didn't even hear him knock. Now I've gotta go to another city to get my package. This is not delivery. This ""courier company"" is terrible, they're not at all interested in delivering anything, its much easier to have everyone come to them. Not even a convenient location, just in the middle of nowhere, and far away from where it was supposed to be delivered. Two other offices much closer and actually in the SAME CITY, but nope, I'll be needing to take an hour long drive to their Etobicoke location. Will be contacting Fido(sender) about this issue and ensuring my future packages are FedEx or Canada Post."
Paid extra for shipping. “Attempted” delivery at an apartment building with 24/7 concierge... no notice left but my guess is a delivery wasn’t even attempted. Didn’t contact me when it couldn’t be delivered until I had a day to figure it out or they would send back. Customer service said she could send this location a suggestion to hold it longer but could not confirm. Disappointed.
Ordered through Amazon for expedited shipping. The night before delivery in in see the tracking page saying  incorrect address could not deliver even though my address vwas perfectly submitted. Purolator did not even contact me. I called them to tell them it was fine and to ship it on time. I had only one day off to be home to receive it. And they refused to ship it next with enough notice. Now I have to spend more money to go pick it up in some far away warehouse. And it's a big tv and heavy which cost a great deal. What's the point of me paying extra for guaranteed delivery if you can't own up to mistakes on your end and ensuring you deliver on those promises. Amazon really needs to switch to a better company becuase they consistently miss deadlines.
"I was at work when they arrived at my doorstep and left a note saying to pick it up at Kipling Avenue.  I went the same night to pick it up and within 10 minutes of walking into the location, I received my parcel. People complain about Purolator and their parcels not at the location even though they got the slip but if they weren't stupid enough to randomly go to the location that is closest to them and actually read which warehouse it was dispatched from, they wouldn't have a hard time.Great service!!"
"I was not expecting a package, and was busy and couldn't answer when they rang my buzzer. They could have left me a message but didn't. They could (and should!) have left a ticket so I knew who was at my door so I could follow up to get the package. No ticket, just an automated phone call three days later when I was nowhere near pen and paper or computer. Robotic voice very rapidly rattled off the tracking number and I had no opportunity to write it down. I was only given one business day to pick up the package, so now I have to drop everything to run and get this package. Absolutely ridiculous!"
"3 stars for the actual location service, but 0 stars for the delivery to the door. Sent a gift and they received no knock at the door and no delivery sticker, and they were HOME ALL DAY!  Insted, I only a phone call with automated ""holding your package here for 3 days"" information!!!  WHAT!?!?!  Not even clear that it was a Purolator delivery message.   I did not receive any email shipping notification for tracking or delivery notification email.  So now I have to notify the gift recipient who is at Bloor and Bathurst, that they have to bus it out to the west end!?!?!   Wow this was money well spent.  Only 1 delivery attempt made?!?!?!  Come to think of it, this same thing happened to me when a parcel was supposedly ""attempted"" to be delivered to me at my own residence. Strange how UPS doesn't seem to have a problem delivering to our address.  I would prefer to have some competition in our parcel delivery market, but please Purolator, give me something to work with here!  It's hard to argue against all these 1 star reviews being given saying the same thing over and over."
"Ordered a product for next day delivery (before the mail strike announcement was causing them much delay).  3 business days later, and still no package. They claim they came to the address 2 times and said no one was available, however people have been here everyday from 7:30am-6:30pm. I even left them explicit instructions on where to go. Not even a phone call to the number I left them. Now they're saying the best way for me to get my package is to pick it up and won't refund my shipping costs. Don't plan on using purolator anymore."
"May god help your soul if you have been trapped using this logistic “crown” funded service to receive packages this holiday season. This organization is the epitome of disenfranchising the consumer and taking away all their power and simply doing as they wish with your property/parcel. If you like being powerless as a consumer and listening to excuse after excuse about why things aren’t going as planned this is the organization for you! I was supposed to recieve a parcel November 30, and instead or receiving it I got a notification for a “missed connection”. Surprised by this I figured I would get it the next day, so I called customer service and told them I wanted the parcel to be moved to their “Depot” location at Kipling by my work. The customer service agent assured me it would be at Kipling by end of business day on Friday dec 1. I stressed how important it was that it be there and not at my home as I would not be able to recieve it and I would instead swing by after work to the “depot”. The next day, they attempted delivery at my address! I kid you not! So then I called customer service again and the agent said “ we marked it down, but we are busy so they must have still thrown it on the truck”. Well now my package is at a nearby location by my house that closes at 7, I made someone race there at full speed to get it. And they just made it on time. I have never been this motivated to write a review but this incident prompted this reaction."
"I had the same experience as everyone else pretty much. No knock at delivery, I was waiting at the door, and was told I had to go to this location which is ridiculous. When I called to ask, I was told I could request another delivery attempt but I had to guarantee that I would be home for an entire business day (all day, 9-5) which is not possible for most people. The woman on the phone was incredibly rude to me, and not helpful at all, just repeating that I had to be at home, that they cannot estimate delivery. If this wasn't an order through an online retailer, I would have never used Purolator. Drivers don't even attempt to knock, their customer service is horrendous and their locations are inaccessible. Would be zero stars if possible"
"Bad customer service.I dropped off five Express Packs and asked for more. The person there wouldn't give me any and the reason was unclear. I was told to call an 800 number and have the supplies delivered to me. As a result, I couldn't courier anything else that day and Purolator lost business."
"I have to say I am very impressed with the turnover which Purolater delivers packages! Sent a package yesterday from Toronto and it is already in Calgary.I also appreciate that the delivery guy from Purolater (older guy, always looks happy with a smile) rings the door bell as a heads up a package is here instead of just leaving it there. I really do appreciate it especially in these times of a pandemic their service to the public should be recognized. Thank you!"
"Purolator never attempts to deliver at my address. I'm in a unit with a separate entrance facing the street, which is only a block long. There are people here all day working from home. I get a message that delivery was attempted, and have to spend an hour of my day to pick something up that I paid shipping costs to have delivered.This most recent time, the tracker gives ""incorrect address"" as the reason my package wasn't delivered. This same address, verbatim, seems to never be an issue for anyone else. It conforms exactly to Canada Post guidelines. I'm beginning to doubt my packages ever go out for delivery. Given the option, I would pay extra to have something take twice as long and be held for pick up at the post office."
Amazon delivery by these guys does not guarantee A delivery.First time delivered to another house. Electronics got spoilt. Replacement didn’t arrive. Customer care Made me travel 30 km to the center. They mention there was a mechanical hub issue. Customer care asked me to go pick up the order and the center said not possible. It’s ridiculous. Poor service. Zero respect for a persons time. Would not recommend to anyone. Will not be using purolator ever.
"The worst shipping company on the face of the earth. The delivery guy came into my building and never even made an effort to get my package into my hands. No phone call, no knock on my door, nothing. Just left a delivery notice telling me I had to pick up my package in the middle of nowhere. Had to bike approximately 30km to get there and back from my place. What kind of delivery company forces people to retrieve their package themselves? Never had a problem like this with FEDEX, DHL, UPS or any other shipping company. Next time I'm ordering something online and I see that purolator handles the shipping, I will GLADLY pay extra for another company. If I could rate them 0 stars I would!"
"Worst service ever! Every time I ordered a package delivered with them I had problems. They don’t ring your door and they do not leave a door tag because I leave in an apartment building and they say they cannot fine easily a parking. So, even though you are at home do not expect to receive your package! They also do not care about the distance between their warehouse and your home and they will leave your package in east Etobicoke if you leave downtown Toronto!"
Complete garbage. Several times I have ordered packages that have come through Purolator and almost every single time I have had to go in and pick it up because they were unable to deliver. I look forward to not doing business with Purolator ever again. What's the whole point of a delivery service if I always have to pick up my package? I may as well just drive to the warehouse and pick the damn thing up myself and it would still be faster than these guys and their constant missed attempts!
"The delivery service, the multiple times I've been forced to use it through Amazon, has never... NEVER, once made it to my door. I've been home 3/4 times it was supposed to be delivered and there was no knock, no ring, and no phone call. Zero attempt to actually deliever the package causing me to take an hour out of my day to travel to this location. Not to mention the staff is usually quite rude and unpleasant. Poor delievery + poor service = 1 star."
I have never been so upset!! I picked up a package today February 7th 2017 @ 6:15pm at this Kipling location and the man who was suppose to attend to me was watching some sports on his computer and cut me off. Told me save himself and me time and find my tracking number on the computer nearby. So I did that. It was just me and him in the office (besides my 2 year old daughter) and I had to call out to him 5 times before he took his eyes off whatever he was watching to input my tracking number in the system. I had ordered diapers I didnt expect it to come in such a huge box. When it came out and he validated my identity he said here take it. But today was the day of icy rain I had my baby with me and the store which i never been to had stairs.... He was trying to push me out the door but i had one hand dragging the huge box and one hand holding my daughter trying not to slip and fall from this NOT SALTED stairway. No customer service.. pretty sure they are looking for a lawsuit!
"I ordered a piece of furniture online through Wal-Mart.This order was picked up by Purolator on Friday, February 13th, 2015. However, the product that I ordered just kept on delaying to be delivered to my home. I was told that the first time it didn’t deliver was because the order didn’t arrive in time for Purolator to be picked up. I was unhappy because I took work off to stay at home and to wait for the order to arrive. After, I found out that the weight of the parcel was 107lbs and they have a policy that it needs two staffs to be on the truck.Unfortunately, it seemed like it was extremely difficult for them to get 2 people on the truck. It was very frustrating and caused trouble to get my order delivered.Someone from the depot contacted me and told me that the only time frame they can deliver the product was on Saturday, February 21st, 2015 from 9am to 2pm. I am not available on that day. I asked to be transferred to the supervisor to see if there were other options. After speaking with the supervisor I was beyond disappointed. The customer service at Purolator from the Depot department was totally unacceptable. The supervisor that I’ve spoken to made me feel unpleasant and the attitude was just rude. I was told that I didn’t understand their rules, policies, and that my options are limited due to the weight of my parcel. I fully understand the reason why my options were limited. My concerns were why is it so difficult to get 2 people to be on the truck. I was also told that the delivering date on the tracking system doesn’t mean it will deliver on that day. It sounded as if it was my fault that I took work off and to wait for the parcel. It was very frustrating dealing with them. The supervisor was “attacking” and addressing that I have no choice to satisfy my need. Take it or leave it!  This particular individual pointed out that Walmart is already providing “free” delivery and “free” re-delivering the item on Saturday, February 21st, 2015. I recommended paying extra fees to get it delivered express since I won’t be available on that day however; the supervisor told me it was not an option. I was the given the option to:1.	Hire a mover to pick up the order and to deliver it to my home2.	Drive there myself and to pick up my orderIt was unbelievable that I was advised to hire a mover. As a shipping company they should be ashamed of their business. If I need to hire a mover I don’t need you. The 2nd option was also very inconvenient for me to travel to Kipling since I don’t own a vehicle.The supervisor at the depot rudely said to me, “Since you don’t mind paying extra money, you can hire a mover to come here and pick it up and deliver it to your home. People have done that before!” The tone of voice that was used was unfriendly and I was offended. At that point, I really don’t mind paying extra money to get it delivered. It was just very frustrating as I was waiting for my order.Luckily, I got somoene to deal with this issue. I was told that my parcel was not even considered to be overweight. It was 2 boxes and each of them was less than 74 lbs. The parcel was finally delivered on Friday, February 20th, 2015 and there was actually an option to get it delivered on another day. However, I had to go through a lot of trouble.I will not order online through Walmart again because I do not trust Purolator shipping my orders. It was not a pleasant experience. If this is an ongoing issue then most of the Walmart customers who ordered heavier items will most likely go through the same thing as me."
Worst company ever. U really don't know why they are still in business. Even if I am home as today it is always an attempted delivery. I never dealt with a driver from Purolator. I am always dealing with their notes and their call centre. Amazon or Canada post will always do their best to deliver. Purolator will do their best to leave a note as if it was an attempted delivery. We are lucky that they have been trained on how to stick notes and not to deliver goods.
"Had a package that was supposed to be overnighted to arrive  by Thursday. No update on the package until Friday afternoon by which time I received an update saying it would arrive Monday. I come home today (Saturday) only to find that it was delivered, but because I wasn’t here it had been sent to their horrible offices at Kipling which is closed on Sundays. I live down the street from a post how hard is it to have it sent there? This is why amazon is killing companies like you."
"My first experience getting a delivery from them and it's been a nightmare!! It was supposed to be here Tuesday, then Wednesday nothing now today it's says but it still says delayed? This was paid for 2 day shipping and it's 2 days late. I have to wait until 10am to show if it is being delivered today! Avoiding any orders that have this company delivering it's a total nightmare! I expect this with Canada post not with a courier company!!"
"Terrible customer service. They claim that the delivery was 'attempted' yet the buzzer was not used and no delivery slip was left behind. I was only notified by a cut-off voicemail informing me that the package was taken to Etobicoke, further than where the package was initially coming from. When I attempted to call, I was told by an automated system the wait time would be over 10 minutes...it was over 30 minutes before I hung up. I resorted to email instead. Through several interactions with customer service over email and a span of 7 days, they came to the conclusion that the package had been returned to sender and it was no longer their issue. They didn't even place a hold on the item until this issue was resolved. Worst shipping company out there!"
"I wish I could also give a zero. I see there are plenty of negative reviews here and they are rightfully so. I honestly feel bad for all the csrs at this location as it is not there fault. I am even wondering if the delivery truck drove near my location at all. It seems that regardless of the numerous complaints the service will never get better. I think even as consumers if we don’t want to use this service, we are bound by the sellers who opt to use this service."
"The delivery man call my buzzer once and I did not have my phone close to me so couldn answer quick and I figured out that it should be my package so I went down to the lobby and checked the mailbox to see if he leave the package there and then this man comes to the door to put a note full of lies he did not put the correct hour, he wrote I did not answer but I think that if he is already there he can at least try one more time or something. Now I know why in the lobby there are always note from this company saying that they couldnt deliver the package. it never happens with other companies. Terrible costumer service."
"I just had a horrible experience with Purolator.  We shipped 2 boxes with them EXPRESS as we had a tight deadline to get the package to our customer.Well one of the boxes arrived but the other did not.  After days and hours spent on the phone with purolator (and them not knowing where my package was) it was delivered over a week later, missing our customer's deadline causing us to lose the sale.I contacted them about the EXPRESS fee they charged as the package did not arrive EXPRESS.  Because they marked that there was a mechanical failure they would not give a refund or deduct any fees.WOW great customer service.  Apparently it's your customer's fault when your machines ""break down"".  We ship multiple packages a day, every day so you would think they would want to keep us happy.  This is the second major error in two weeks.  Makes me wonder if we will continue to use Purolator."
"Review is more about Purolator than this particular location.  I'm not sure why bestbuy uses this company for deliveries, like they want you to never order with them.  We've had at least 5 packages (big and small) in the past year shipped with Purolator and without exception they all tell you to pick up the package from this location, even though it's 15min driving from our house.  I've been home even a couple of those times and they just leave the notice without bothering themselves to ring the bell. I'm starting to doubt they even bring the packages with them and just carry notices.  We even put a paper saying please leave the package, no luck. They told us to get an official label from them and put on the door, still no luck.  If we didn't have a car it would be impossible to come this far and pick up the package.  For the large items it's double the hassle.  I just stopped ordering from any website that uses Purolator just to save myself from this company."
"Somehow, every other courier or delivery company finds a way to avoid asking me to make a 30km-round trip to pick up a package. Everyone has a central depot, but no one else ever asks me to go to theirs.Yes, you can call Purolator and request the package be transferred to a more convenient location; in this respect, their customer service staff are quite helpful. But this shouldn't be necessary. It should also be noted that Purolator doesn't proactively tell anyone this is possible - when you hear the automated delivery message, there are no options given except picking up the package at this incredibly inconvenient location.On top of this, the fact that Purolator doesn't leave delivery notices can make it difficult to know your tracking code, if you aren't able to jot it down when listening to the automated message.I've been going through this for years. Customer service tries to be helpful, but they've shown no signs of actually changing this infuriating & inconvenient process.It's simply absurd that Purolator can't automatically determine a more convenient location and deliver the package there. I'm going to begin telling businesses I won't be ordering from them if they use Purolator to ship."
"I see that I am not the only person who has the issue of an apparent attempted delivery with no delivery notice left and no buzz from the front door of my apartment building.  I've been following the delivery of a package and when I saw Purolator was delivering I shuttered. Yesterday afternoon I was checking the tracking details and came home early from work hoping to be here, so I do not know when the attempt was made.  Once, a driver did come into the building without buzzing me from the front door but they knocked so softly that if I hadn't been within a few feet of my front door I never would have heard the knock.  Purolator, do something about your sub-standard delivery to multi-dwelling buildings!  It seems this is a common occurrence for your drivers."
"Had a package""delivered"" to my apartment in Toronto. Was left a notice saying it's available for pickup at the depot which isn't even in the same city! They have locations in Toronto too but when I called in they said they don't use them and the woman was rude. If I could I would give them zero stars.I have a note on my Newegg account to never ship with Purolator for this very reason guess I need to have a chat with Amazon as well. Considering that there are multiple shipping companies in the area it's a damn miracle they are even in business."
"I would give 0 stars if possible. I literally watched the tracking status of my package go from ""in transit"" to ""attempted delivery"". No Buzz. No knock on the door. No package slip. Now I have to drive all they way out to their location in the middle of nowhere, to get my package. And then I will probably have to argue with them about why I don't have a package slip, as they did not leave one. The Purolator driver probably went to Burger King instead to get a Whopper on Whopper Wednesday and *boop* in the machine that he attempted delivery. They just need to get a bunch of bots to automate this job and clear out all the useless trash (people) who can't do this simple job."
This far flung location is the place you have to trek to when Purolator fails to actually try to deliver your package. More than once I have received a message from them saying they attempted a delivery when I was home even though nobody ever rang my bell. There is nothing like the terrible drive from downtown to Etobicoke to be reminded of why you should never send anything with this company if you can avoid it.
"Driver doesn't knock on the door. Just leaves a piece of paper saying collect from 30 mins away from your place.The timing on the paper says they close at 9, cx service centre says they close at 9 but when you get there, they say they close at 8! Who the hell is going to update that?!People are ordering online to get things delivered to them, not for them to go 30 mins away to collect those things!Such an unfriendly staff as well when you reach the collection point. They just leave and go in the back.REALLY BAD EXPERIENCEWOULD NEVER CHOOSE PUROLATOR AGAIN!"
"I have never experienced  customer service like this with any organization. I was expecting a delivery as per the dates mentioned and provided to me in my confirmation. I am now chasing Purolator to retrieve my package, and this is costing me money and time to go out of my way. I was told by the attend at the depot, that my ""package is across the street"" and that they would not be able to get it for me, after I had made a 2hr drive to pick it up because of the urgency of having the package. This has caused me headache and has cost me a fair amount of money due to not having the contents of the package.On top what makes it worse is that I requested to speak to a manager, but as per the attendant, she explained ""all managers leave the facility by 5-6pm"", okay thats fair, so I asked for contact information such as a business card for the manager of the location, to which she provided me a piece of paper with the name ""JESSICA.W"" and a number and extension that was out of service. Just to recap, I drove 2 hours out of my way, to pick up a package at the depot, which was to be delivered on the same day, but due to an error with the system, didn't make it on the delivery truck, and after requesting for someone at the facility to retrieve it because of going down there, to hear them say ""they are unable to do it"", and providing me incorrect contact information, which has to be the most despicable customer service I've ever experienced with any organization.I am writing this as I wait to speak to a ""supervisor"" or floor lead with customer service, I've been on hold for 4hrs in total, trying to sort this out, and still am getting no where, but the run around, being promised call backs from managers, that my package will be able to be picked up immediately, with no response or communication, and the depot now is closed until Monday. So the package I was supposed to get on Friday, is now costing me money to not have for the time I needed it and on top I have to pay extra for delaying the process for my endeavours with the content of the package. Absolute tragedy, please save yourself the headache and trouble and not use Purolator services, I am a victim of this unfortunately, and I would never recommend using Purolator for any shipping services. You're better of with the competitors like FedEX or DHL. I've used their services and can tell you from first had experience, that they are accurate to what they say, and the communication is phenomenal.Unfortunately I have to give them a 1 star to even post this here, but they deserve a 0/5 for communication and customer service. I hope this gets to the right person and has been a great insight for other individuals considering using their services."
"My package was suppose to arrive on the 22, I checked online and it said it was ready for pickup.I didn't receive a card, so I checked again to see what location it was at, instead of telling me where to pick up,  in red it stated my package was being returned to sender.I called purolator and they said it was their fault and that they would contact the warehouse. They also informed me that if my package is still there ,I would be able to pick  it up at their Kipling location. I live downtown where I am sure there are lots of drop offs.  I checked the directions and  it is going to take me upwards of forty minutes to get there.Now I am waiting for a call from them, with no time frame or guarantee that my package is even there. The women at the call centre apparently cannot call them herself.This has been a frustrating experience, if I could give them a negetative star I would. They don't even deserve a one."
"If you contact them to transfer your package to a closer location, how long would that take? I'm so eager to get mine that I will make the trek to 800 Kipling Ave on a Saturday morning. I don't want to have to call them, get them to move it to the downtown location, and then wait around until it's ready to be picked up. It would really be nice (i.e. a minimum customer service standard) for them to hold packages at the nearest location, as opposed to a place that's not convenient at all to visit. Looking at all the reviews here (and the template response from Vince, Social Media Coordinator, Customer Care Team, Go Team!) points to a common thread: we don't care how terrible our service is, we'll still have our jobs no matter what."
I have 3 boxes to pick up with 1 tracking number.Purolator at pick up location give me 1 box saying that I need tracking number (2 more) for each box separately. I waisted 2 hours trying to get 2 more tracking numbers from shipper. After 2 hours I went back to Purolator and my other 2 boxes were finally found and were given to me. What a waist of my time!!!
"Fantastic customer service, love the new scan your own label and return machine. Will drive out of my way to come to this location!Thank you!"
"Received no notice of delivery attempt (no email, no card saying they'd attempted delivery), and they don't provide their drivers with phones to make calls. So if you don't have a buzzer, you literally cannot get something delivered to you. If I hadn't checked  the online tracking number, the package would've just been returned to the sender. I cannot stress this enough - you guys need to start leaving notices of delivery...Depending on where you live (downtown Toronto in my case), if something is shipped with Purolator, it's not actually a delivery because they won't actually deliver it, you have to travel an hour to Etobicoke to an office that is open for only 5 hours total on weekends (not 5 hours each day). Most inconvenient way to get packages shipped to you. And this is all conditional on actually checking your tracking number to catch when it's available at their desk because they won't give you a notice.One final grievance - their call centre makes you say your tracking number out loud to its computer system (which, for me, gets it wrong three times in a row before getting it right), and then patches you through to a representative who then doesn't have your number, so you just have to tell it to them anyways. I asked why - the agent didn't know why and agreed it was a dumb way of doing it."
"These guys are idiots. They didnt even try to do anything to deliver my package. Didn't buzz, didn't call me, didn't leave a note and didnt even talk to any human being in the building or management office which is literally directly in front of the front door of the building. I doubt they even came by or even had the package on them.I called them and they said it would be delivered today. Checked the tracking and it is now in this place for some reason and this DELIVERY company is telling me to come by and PICK IT UP MYSELF?!! I talked to a live agent and told them the situation and they still don't have a clue whats going on. The live agent said they scheduled the delivery for tomorrow and I told them my buzz code, contact information and gave them instructions. The live agent said ""I added a note"". I have absolutely zero faith this package will come to my door or if they even have it. I will never use Purolator again for as long as I live."
"This is the second time this week I've had to pick up packages myself, from the depot.  I've been home both times and the slip has been placed on my door.  A simple knock would save me a couple hours of time just this week.If I must pickup the package that's fine; I just don't understand the thought process of showing up at my door with no intent to drop off the package.I'm disappointed with this service.  I thought maybe a knock on the door could have slipped by me.  With a guard dog... however seeing these reviews lead me to believe there is a lack of professionalism going on here.Please fix this"
"I was forced to come to this Puralotor since the drivers were not competent enough to deliver my daughter's mattress to my apartment. This location is really small, and I went on a Saturday and it was busy. I found that the employees there were nice enough, but.. had a certain aura about them. Very... strict? Not sure if I'm using the right word. They don't play around. They talk very sternly to the customers, as I observed, but they weren't being disrespectful, from what I could see. The place just seems lifeless and a bit dingy, located in a very odd area. It's easy to miss, if you're not paying attention when you're driving."
Purolator gave  my package to a third party and it took 2 weeks to get to me when it was suppose to be 3 days.  I even asked them to hold at warehouse after 2 failed deliveries. I was told 2 times it was  at the warehouse so i went and it was not there. They had  a special tracing team look for package because they had no idea where it was.
"Terrible staffs, they argue with customers a lot. Ruined my vibe to be witnessing that scene.When it was my turn I asked the staff if my other package was at the storage (I just took my chances because amazon says its still on the way) then the staff said ""well you should've told me that earlier"", with a straight face. I know it was my fault but he could've been nicer.From that time on, whenever I order at amazon I check the carrier. And if it says purolator I cancel it right away."
"First want to say that Customer service is fantastic. However, I always have a terrible experience with this location. My packages don't get delivered. No notices are left. I have a disability and don't have time to be chasing down Purolator. Will not use this location and will tell those I do business with to please not use them because of the inconvenience."
"Two days in a row they attempted to deliver to the wrong unit, even after correcting them. The second time they simply left the delivery slip in the same wrong unit door and went.Desperately wish Amazon/Best Buy stop dealing with this company. They find ways to botch up every single delivery."
"WORST.  They can't call or try other methods when not available or before delivery. UPS, Fedex etc do and I always get packages. Purlator guys just knock on the door and go away in 2 secs (long before you reach the door) leaving a note for pick up, which is 30 mins drive from Mississauga City Centre. I waste 90 minutes every time during business days. They are closed on the weekend. I tell every sender NOT to use Purlator."
"I feel sorry for businesses who use Purolator, because personally I would avoid ordering from those who use Purolator. I know Purolator will never deliver to my door, and I will always end up calling them, waiting for an hour to talk to a service rep., then ask him/her to put the shipment to a pickup location that is closest to me, finally go pick it up myself a week later.I am pretty sure they don't attempt in door delivery, not even once. I live in a condo building, and if Purolator ever try to deliver to my door, they would have to go through condo security first (who would call me before they let Purolator in). Over the past two times I was expecting a Purolator delivery, no one called me, no delivery slip was left, I was only able to find that they ""attempted"" online after the expected delivery date."
I will have to think twice if a company ships their products with Purolator.  The drivers do not leave a door tag REPEATEDLY and I have been receiving phone calls to pick up my package to places where my package is not.  They have two full days to re-deliver something.  I have wasted so much time for a parcel and have been driving around the city.  I still don't have my parcel. AWFUL.
Got my tracking number after ordering from Amazon. Called them up immediately to arrange delivery. Package arrived at the requested time. Easy peasy.Good going Purolator. I’ll use you over those other embarrassments.
This review goes to all big name courier companies not just you purolator! You are all really bad at the business of delivering packages. There are many small companies that do amazing at deliveries and maybe you should look into learning from them. If you can't handle the demand of so many deliveries then hire more couriers or couriers that can do their job in a timely fashion. No offense to the hard working couriers with purolator but all big courier companies are bad at what they do. PS. If you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen!!!
"Had a packaged delivery show up, I missed the buzzer call. The driver did NOT leave a notice slip. A week later I get an automated call leave a message saying that I only had till the next day to go pick up my package. Purolator delivery men are awful!! A month before a driver forged a signature on a package that required one. It was for a $500 laptop. He then left it outside our apartment door!!! Complained to Purolator and still haven't heard back as to what reprimand (hopefully being fired) the driver is getting. NEVER get delivery from Purolator"
I was forced to pick up my item here.. I should just bought my item in store than ordering online with this shipping company... Whats the point of ordering online to ship it to your place if you gonna ended up picking 2 hour far from your place..Really disappointed with this company. Other courier company like Canada post and UPS are better because they left your item near your place.
"I always hate it when packages are shipped through Purolator; something always goes wrong and I end up having to travel to Timbuktu to get my package. This time was no exception. The delivery guy was too lazy to bother looking in my buildings directory for my apartment number so the package was sent back. Keep in mind that this was a ""priority"" shipment from Whitby to Toronto... It took 3 days. At least the guy at the desk there was nice."
"They are located way out west near Kipling station which is really inconvenient, however with a simple phone call they were willing and able to redeliver it to an address that worked better for me - with no charge. No hassles - I had great customer service. Shame about the poor reviews here, but I wonder if they gave them a call to try to sort it out first. I also didn't have to wait on hold (I pressed #5 on the phone) which was nice."
"Ya thanks for sending my package to the farthest depot in ETOBICOKE 20km away when I live in downtown Toronto. There are 3 depots in downtown Toronto. Let's see, 2hr commute via transit or 1hr via car.Garbage company. UPS drops off at closest location to the destination. Is it delivery or pickup?!? When Amazon phases you out I'll be glad you all lose your jobs since you clearly don't do them anyway."
"Pretty much the same experience as most of the other reviews. I was literally 5feet from my door when they left the sticky. I can honestly say that the driver made no attempt to knock, or ring the doorbell at all.And then I find out the pickup location is in etobicoke! an hour+ by transit from my place downtown!! What insanity is that. I would never have even bought my stuff online if I knew this would happen. Such a waste of time. Never again will I purchase anything from anyone using Purolator."
"Can you give NO STARS?  BUYER BEWARE! Choose any other company over Purolator.  They cannot help, they do not communicate internally.  Packages have not been delivered.  When we went to pick them up they would not release the package.  No one would come on the phone to hear our circumstance.We paid for next day service and the parcel is still sitting in a warehouse.  The connection was missed, I will NEVER USE THIS COMPANY again.  I would trust a hitch hiker with my package before this horrible company"
"Purolator is just like FedEx. If you live in a house and package can fit in your mail box then they leave it there. If it won't fit, they ring the bell. I have been a delivery guy for years and I can tell you most house door bells don't work. Home owners think they do work, when they don't or occupants are busy in the basement so they leave the pickup note. If an apartment, however, they have no key unlike Canada Post. So they press the unit buzzer number. Now is here is the problem, some apartments buzzer code doesn't correspond with the the apartment unit. Let's say your apartment unit is 503, and your buzzer code is 2429, this code is not printed on the package mailing address so the driver has no choice but to press 503 and in this case the driver is buzzing someone else's unit because that code probably is for unit 302. I gave 3 stars because the pickup location is usually 800 Kipling. That's far if you live up north. I live 20 mins drive from there but it sucks if you don't drive"
"nobody really attempted to deliver at my home.nobody ever buzz, they just leave the notice that they passed by.There were 3 notices from other customers outside the door of my building. I ordered something small from amazon that could be easily fits in the mailbox, but now I have to spend more money on ttc and 2 hours to go and pick it up at kipling from north york ! I call this a scam, I payed the delivery at my home, not at kipling! never happen with other couriers.Very much disappointed."
"My package was to arrive Thursday jan 7,  tracking stated was on delivery truck at 8:16am ... I live 1km from pickup center.  Now it's on the 3rd day (sat jan 9) and still no package.  I assumed because it was in transit, I would of received it early Thursday morning , or atleast by end of night  . Should of opted for Canada post but figured purolator would be faster.Well the day isnt over yet, so we will see if it comes today."
Ordered clothes online and wasn't home to accept the package... so they left a note saying I can pick it up at a location that will take me over an hour to get to. This is especially frustrating because there are at least 3 stores within walking distance that can hold packages and parcels. It's as though Purolator refuses to exercise common sense.
"Purolator is definitely a nightmare for someone like me waiting for a very important documentation sent from the government of Ontario. They started their secret shipping on 23rd and not even one word was released to me till 29th. The guy called me on 29th and said since i wasnt home when he delivered, they will arrange another shipment next day and let me know. However the next day noon I received a voice message asking me to pick up my package from their only unique office at the east end. Hilarious! When did the second shipment happen? How come they faked the second delivery on the tracking description just one hour after the first try within the same day! It was just simply ugly getting rid of your customer and responsibility in this way! I would be most happy to write negative reviews about this joke. PLEASE STOP PLAYING JOKES ON YOUR CUSTOMER!"
"Purolator disgusts me. The driver only dropped off a notice. He did not ring my buzz code not once. He just posted the notice on the window. My superintendent said he saw the gentleman with two notices in hand and no package. I happened to be home today and I am getting the run around and told to go all the way to the Kipling location to pick up the package. I do not drive and have a young baby. I might as well have just went into the store and bought what they had instead if shopping online. This is the third time this has happened to me. I was so mad the last time the csr at purolator said that I can have it shipped to 1 Adelaide street which is closer to me, and put the package to my attention. This is what I did this time around and they still cannot get it right. The first time this happened luckily my neighbor was in the lobby and luckily he knew I was home that day. I asked the driver why he did not buzz and his excuse was that he does not want to get a ticket because they issue tickets downtown like crazy. I mean you pay for a service and cannot get service. This is ludicrous."
"0 of 5 starsUnreliable.Inconvenient.Horrible.Absolutely the worst courier company I have had to deal with.Two recent amazon purchases were done through this purolator and both were screwed up. Issues tracking the package, problems with the truck and plenty of other excuses. Called in the morning, told that the package was on the truck to be delivered. At the end of the day.... nothing. In one case the package was on the truck. The truck went to the drop off. And... nothing. The other? Worse.Do not ship, or have your items shipped, through purolator if you intend for your package to reliably get there."
"Really wish there is an option for no star. It makes no sense. I ordered a mattress on Amazon coordinate to the time when I move and expecting it to arrive on Thursday or if anything Friday. However, I hear nothing but a delay on amazon website. No one call or email me for anything. When I call purolator to ask what happened, the guy told me the latest I can get it is next Tuesday which I will no longer be in the location and where should I sleep on for the weekend. Customer service has no suggestion nor the intention to help me in any way until I ask if I can pick it up myself. Yea, I need to pick it up from a delivery service from a facility where the job is to deliver. Ironic. Apparently mattress is heavyweight package now and require two drivers to move."
"You WILL always get stuck driving to the Kipling warehouse. No notice on the door...a Friday... my wife was home (day off) .... I was home .... less than 2 hours ""on the truck"" before"" need to schedule a delivery"". I now just phone up and confirm it's in the warehouse and arrange for a van to go pick it up. Sadly some sellers don't tell you they are sticking you with Purolator. 2018 Update: happened again a few months ago; another Purolator, another drive to Kipling. It doesn't happen with other companies, just Purolator. 2019 update: actually delivered, just the WRONG address...drove over and got it."
"Choose Purolator if you want to see incompetence in action.Absolutely the worst ""delivery service."" It'd be more accurate to call them a ""come pick up your package at a remote location after we fail the delivery service.""Every time I deal with them I want to shoot myself. Everything about them is awful."
"Purolator guy didn’t even bother reading the note I left out for him or the 2 calls I made prior to him even picking up the package for delivery to correct the unit number. Just left without leaving a notice card. Was then told the package would be at the depot 12 kilometres away from me by end of day. That clearly didn’t happen. Everytime I called, wait times were over 30 minutes. Now I have to wait over the whole weekend to get an extremely vital and time sensitive package. Thanks Purolator."
"Not sure how a so-called ""courier service"" can operate when a driver drives by, takes off, doesn't leave a notice on the door, and you find out a week alter that your delivery is in Etobicoke. The exact location of warehouse is not revealed online so you spend another hour on hold with an agent to find out that it is, in fact, being held somewhere reachable by land, sea or air. Now that you have a location, you have to spend about an hour commuting to a remote warehouse to pick up the package.It'll be a great day when companies like Amazon, Google and Uber will inevitably push Purolator out of the logistics market."
"If I could give no stars I would !, Every time I see that a product will be sent through Purlator I know I will have problems, and my delivery from today, wasn't the exception. Whoever is delivering is no capable to ring a bell to let the people know they are ""here"", is easier to write that the person wasn't available or there was no access to the building. Now I have to go to the Purlator building to pick up my package bc it will the only way to make sure I will get it !!!!!! THE WORST COURIER EVER"
"Hands down one of the most inefficient and useless courier services that have managed to giant leap backwards in history to pre-pigeon service era. Did not even attempt to follow the clear delivery instructions even after two re-deliveries were scheduled and this no-signature bullshit does not help. The notice prompted me to show up at this location, which would take approximately 2 hours round trip for me to get to because sure that sounds reasonable to tell a client to do. I recommend just strapping your package to a messenger pigeon."
"This is my first experience with Purolator, because a friend of mine ordered a gift off my baby registry at Babies R Us. I would not deal with them again if I had a choice. They are very unfriendly on the phone, if you are dealing with customers you should at least pretend you enjoy your job. Also they will make no attempt to help you at all if you don't have your tracking number, so make sure you have it on hand. Now I have to haul myself at 7 months pregnant to pick up my package, with no idea how big/heavy it is."
"I too think they are a crappy service overall but to be fair a couple things need to be pointed out. Firstly, they did call my cell phone when they were unable to get into the building because the buzzer didn't work. Secondly, you can get your package moved from 800 Kipling Ave into downtown Toronto. They ended up moving mine barely 5 minutes from my place. I did this all through a live chat it took about 5 minutes.So yes service is bad but isn't as abysmal as some reviews make it out to be."
"Awful and inept, you better stay home all day to receive your packages and wait by the door (they knock once and run within 20 seconds). Even if you leave a note with signature and all tracking numbers, they still find a reason to not leave your parcels at the door. THEN instead of taking them to oh, maybe a dozen or so drop-off points within your neighbourhood, they take it alllll the way back to some godforsaken corner of the city until you call in and ask for them to reship it. The carbon footprint that Purolator alone must leave on this planet is astounding. They need to revisit their NSR (or SR - sig required) policies BIG TIME. The drivers are NOT independent thinkers, so don't expect the next one to be any better than the last."
"Terrible.  I ordered something on tuesday and was told i would have it the next day or Thursday.  Never came.  Canada day was friday so there was no shipping.   Talked to someone finally on Saturday after being on hold for 1 hour on 2 different phone trying to get through.  Finally the guy says my package was left on the truck and i should have it by tuesday.  I tried to explain that it is medication that comes by mail andi would rather pick it up monday morning and he says i cant do that.  It is on the truck already.So. Anyways. I havent have my epilepsy medication since Thursday.  I havent been able to sleep from the anxiety of having a seizure in my sleep or infront of my children again.If i dont recieve it today, i may have to switch companies and pay double for my medication.Smh"
"I love their dedication and customer service, I paid $45/- to get express delivery service for Passport, a delivery guy came to my door (when I am sitting inside my home, literally 10 feets away) and placed a sticker saying he missed me, and I have to come, pick it up from 12 Kms away!This on door personal invitation to come to visit their office is worth every penny I spent to have it delivered, that's what we call the Purolator Effect!"
"I wasn't home for a package delivery, but instead of leaving it at one of the 3 Toronto locations (the city where I live and where it was delivered to), they sent it all the way back to a location Etobicoke, and are charging me to have it sent anywhere else! Are you freaking kidding me? I also had to do some serious digging to find out the tracking number as the delivery man who left the note scribbled it out in a way that made it very difficult to read."
"Horrible service. Lazy delivery guys who do not knock, neither leave any notice on the door. Then make you travel to the other side of the city to pick up what was supposed to be delivered. I stopped using other seller companies who only ship with Purolator, and I always check before ordering online whether the item is shipped with this “delivery” company."
"Purolator is an archaic nightmare.I had two packages that never got delivered to my door.  I understand purolator's policy but the delivery person didn't even bother to leave a notice.  We had both amazon and telus reach us (my wife and I) to let us know that the packages never made it.My wife called them to re-deliver the package and customer service said they would deliver the next day.  The tracking number showed no change to status so she called again and found out that purolator was not delivering.So... purolator lied to my wife.We are now forced to pick up our packages at a pick up point that is 30 minutes away.I also spoke to Amazon to let them know that I no longer wish to have them ship my stuff via purolator.  Amazon was very helpful.Purolator, simply, does not care about customer service.I will never use purolator as a courier service again.**** Live EditFriday March 29, 2019 19:22 hoursAfter being 100 percent assured by a customer service agent that one of my packages (valued at $3,000) will be available for pick-up, the girl at the counter had to run to speak to her supervisor to find out that the package was ""left behind in the van"" by the driver ""who didn't show up to work today"".   I don't know about you but would you trust a company who  handles courier business like this?  The supervisor ""Eric McLean"" (who was reluctant to give his name so I suspect that is not even his real name) didn't even have to courtesy to speak to us.The courier Driver Route was 246 for anyone who is curious.We are now still currently on hold since around 7PM (currently 7:32PM) with the FIFTH CUSTOMER AGENT for the same order. The only response we have received from Purolator is that they will have a ""Tracking Specialist"" call us before 5pm on Monday.... what the heck is a ""tracking specialist"" ?I have Z E R O confidence in  purolator as a company.  I am now concerned that I have suffered a loss of $3K in goods.Will do a live edit.***Live Edit 7:45pmSpoke to customer care manager Michael O'Connell .  A courteous manager but delivered the news that our package might have been lost or misplaced.There you have it folks.  Unionized work at its finest.I will be speaking to the Telus regional sales manager and have her refrain from using Purolator going forward."
Incompetent and unreliable. I would give it less than No stars but that's the least I was allowed to rate it. I was called twice by Purolator that my package would be delivered on two separate days. they NEVER showed up on either days. Then I received an automated call to pick up my package in etobicoke. Really???? I thought Purolator was the delivery service.....not me. Maybe that's how they stay in business....save on gas and employees to deliver the packages they are paid to by their customers.
"Purolator straight up sucks. Their drivers do not even attempt delivery . After reading so many negative reviews I had to leave my own . Today,(Oct. 29) I as well took the day off work to ensure delivery of my package . I made sure to even go outside and look for the delivery person every 30 mins from 8:15 this morning; when they sent me a notification to await my delivery, until 3:00 this afternoon when low and behold I peek my head out the door to  see the purolator truck driving down the road coming towards me . I started waving and jumping like ""Here I am!"" And the driver did not even stop. Then at 3:44 I received a notification that delivery has been attempted and I now need to contact purolator.  It is super irritating to pay for home delivery, take time off work, and to watch the lazy driver go right by my house.  Pathetic. Should be able to give 0 stars."
Atrocious company explains why they'll never be the best have no desire to improve the brutal service they have I ordered a package from Windsor wad shipped to Toronto beauty so far then they decide to ship it too Edmonton for some reasonI get a cute apology for it. They ship it back to Toronto beauty again were now 10 days into this processdelivery guy comes all the way to my home says no buzzer code and must be confused by the giant tenant board with all the last names on it and struggles to match my last name with one on the board takes the package away got another oh my I'm sorry from someone 3 provinces away which they really could care less about me and my package the tracking system online sucks between delays misdirects and a load of empty sorries I now dont know which depot its at because their sweet online tracking says can't update location. Oh I know should be a delivery slip but can't find that either.Aug 18 to Sept 3 to get a package from Windsor to Toronto to Edmonton to Toronto to ? If anyone knows feel free to help me retrieve my package.
"Excellent customer service. I didn't have a slip because I missed my delivery, but that didn't matter.They went into the back and searched the warehouse and found my two orders.All with a smile!!"
"I wonder if Mr.Vincent is tired of copying and pasting the same response and the company not making any improvements on their delivery. Ordered home shipment, received a call this morning saying THEY RECEIVE ITEM FOR DELIVERY, and that WE HAVE TO PICK UP IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CITY! Seriously?  I live in Kitchener, my sons live in Toronto, do not have a car, THAT""S WHY I ORDERED A DELIVERY for crying out loud!"
"I went to pickup my package last evening.I saw an old women prior to me, the sales guy gave a box to her. She explained to him that there should be 4 boxes and not 1, she  asked him to read the receipt and requested him to go and check for them. Finally she got 4 boxes. I was a bit uncomfortable by seeing that.Next is my turn, I am in front of the sales guy and his desk. He SHOUTED NEXT (not greeted). I gave the receipt, it took 5 mins to come back with package. I showed him my pr card. Questions started from the sales guy, what is your name, your full address, phone number and finally he asked me where i came from ?I was shocked and What's wrong with this person. I asked him how does it matter and why should i tell you that where i came from. I told him if you have problem use my other id, showed him my DL also requested him to take a xerox copy in case if he really want to show to his manager that he is working.I will never use Purolator for sure. They never respect customers, not sure about other locations but 800 Kipling Ave is really bad.I sincerely advise to all, prepare well before you go.### Dear owner of the business, better stop replying copy paste responses to all reviews start finding mistakes at your store and talk to your employees especially with rude guys. All the best."
"I never even got a slip delivered to my door. Only a voicemail left with tracking# and pickup location. I live in downtown Toronto and I don't have a car. It is almost impossible for me to make arrangements to borrow a car all within 5 days because that's as long as they hold it for. Sorry, but it is super inconvenient for me to go all the way out to Etobicoke. When I made my order online and paid for shipping costs, I assumed that my package would be delivered to my door. Now, I have to take extra time and money out of my pocket to drive out there. The whole point of delivery/shipping was to avoid all this inconvenience."
"I'm never at home during office hours. That's why I always ask couriers to leave the packages (if they're not much expensive) by my apt door when they dial buzz code (buzz code is linked to my cell phone). However, Purolator is the ONLY courier that never does that. They don't do that even when I beg them. Then I'm the one who has to travel half the city sometime for hours to get to one of their faaaaar pickup locations to pick up small cheap packages. One time I had a package sent from downtown to midtown, few days later  I had to pick it up from Vaughan!!!!! True! The pickup location was much further than the sender location =)"
"Honestly, I live in downtown toronto and I couldn't believe that just because I wasn't there to pick up a delivery they sent it back all the way to this location. Aren't there any other locations in downtown. I spent $30+ on Ubers to make it and pick up my parcel. I don't have a car so it made it very difficult. Would have made it so much easier if it was sent to a downtown location. Not happy one bit"
"Without fail, Purolator makes no attempt whatsoever to buzz up to your apartments to let you know there is a delivery downstairs.  Two days in a row I waited for a package from Purolator, I was home all day both days.  Purolator came and went without buzzing up to my apartment.  The first day they didn't even bother leaving a notice so can't even be sure that they actually came to my apartment or not.  If I want my package, I have to travel 1.5 hours (including a twenty minute walk from Kipling subway to the depot) for a total of 3 hours travel time to retrieve a parcel that could have been delivered if the Purolator courier had bothered to buzz up to my apartment.  Worst courier in the city for residential packages.  I will make a point of asking any company that is planning on sending me a package not to use Purolator!!!  This is standard practise for Purolator, as they do this every single time.  Canada Post is much more reliable for residential deliveries.  If you are a company reading this, don't use Purolator for residential deliveries as the service is the worst in the city."
The worst ever period. My son is confined to his apartment unit 24-7 YET purolator could not even take the time to buzz his apartment. They did email almost 3 full days later to say there was no answer at his place. He sent me an email with all the attached information BUT the worst company in this business would not allow me to pick it up even though I had 3 pieces of government ID's. He does not drive and lives 40 minutes from the Kipling pick up. We contacted New Egg and requested that they NEVER ship anything to us again via this crap company.
Thanks Purolator for delivering my cell phone to  the middle of nowhere during COVID season. IF I GET COVID FROM PICKING UP MY PACKAGE AND IF IT PASSES ONTO MY PARENTS IM SUING YOUR COMPANY. Twice I waited on hold for over an hour for nothing... Just so they could tell me I would have to wait another week if I wanted them to deliver it TO A HOUSE!!!! worst company ever...
"worst service ever...they do not have proper internal communication. I have been requesting my important document but they are not delivering it. try to call customer care, They said it will delivered to you tomorrow. I stay home all day, no one came. I request to hold it at nearest purolator store, I went there. They said we do not have your shipment. Its at other location. then I went next day, They said its with driver for delivery while I requested to hold at store. its my passport..i been waiting for it to deliver since last 4 days. Have visited there store 2 times but no luck. they just don't care about customer and they do not have importance of time. I am not going to use purolator service in life and I request all you the same....Try to warn your friends and family not to use there service.Purolator is worst shipping company. I wish I can get them zero star"
"Awful awful service. My gramma paid for express shipping. I was home for 2 days. No knock on the door. I called to complain they said they'd deliver it tomorrow.The next day I get a knock on the door, I run over, no one is there. So I run down the hall and hear the elevator doors close. I went downstairs and caught him outside. Told him I just missed him and wanted my package. He said he didn't have anything and couldn't deliver packages outside. I told him - that's funny cause they called yesterday to say they'd delivery the package today. And he said if he has it he'll come back later. But I work later so I won't be home. Such a mess!!!!"
"Purolator is the worst delivery service ever.They never deliver anything on time.They have excuses regarding the address all the time.I called them last time and gave them suggestions about fixing their issues, the lady i spoke to told me that I'm the only one who complains and othere customers are all happy.However when i checked online reviews i saw that actually 90% of the customers are not happy.So close the business or listen and bring  changes."
"I will say that this was one of my first times using Purolator and I very much enjoyed it, I had a package that required a signature that was sent back to the office, had a bit of miscommunication via the Purolator chat, but when i did arrive in the office the woman at the front was beyond lovely and was able to clear everything up, and was able to make sure I received my packages the same day. Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews about ""i had to travel because i wasn't home for my package delivery"", it's common sense that that's how deliveries work, not to mention there are options to schedule a re-delivery as opposed to picking up the package in person."
"I avoid using Purolator because I have nothing but issues with them. However, this time I didn't have a say in the carrier chosen. I missed a package delivery despite my door being wide open and two people being at home. The door knocker left on my door said the package would be ready at 6:30pm. Went to pick it up at 6:30 and was told the truck hasn't arrived yet. They had no way of checking apparently, since the person said they don't communicate with that department! I was casually told to come back, as if the depot is anywhere near my neighborhood. My issue is, why say the package will be available at 6:30 if there needs to be processing time at the depot? This should be accounted for in the time given to the customer."
"This location was ideal, since I was eating lunch in the area!  Purolator was the only option for an Amazon return.  I wasn’t a fan of this courier in the past, but I’m relieved to see some changes in place.  I was a bit nervous, since I feel that I’m responsible for the items, and other companies provide some sort of paper receipt.  I didn’t need any packaging, except the barcode emailed to me.  I still wrapped the items in a waterproof bag, with the order info inside, and my return address label on the outside.The staff member showed me the bar code once it was packaged up, and I took a photo.  I received the refund from Amazon a few days later."
U guys are getting some bad reviews on lately. And yet u don't do anything about it.   Same thing happened to me. . My dad is home all day. Didn't hear a knock.Don't do business with Purolator. Go DHL or FedEx. These guys obviously don't care about their customers.
"REPEAT ISSUE:Two months back I selected pickup and drop service, for pickup they came outside building and call me so I can handover docx but at the time of delivery they claimed they attempted and receiver is inaccessible. HOW’S THAT POSSIBLE. Then I have to go and pickup from this location. Although, I paid for drop service as well.NOW, Today I specially took day off to receive parcel. I contacted(2:15PM) customer service to provide my buzzer number again and verify that they have every information to deliver parcel. SAME HAPPENED AGAIN, Around 5PM I tracked my parcel(AGAIN RECEIVER INACCESSIBLE) no one has ever buzzed or call me so I can go and receive parcel . Which means they lie every time.SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST DELIVERY TEAM, they are not doing there part well. I can even send screenshots to prove that I contacted purolator and person over call she said we have all information but then why not delivered. I have to go to location at 8:25PM for PICKUP.VERY BAD SERVICE"
"Tracking number DZS000039677, I have requested a preferrence to pick up from location ""Photofast in Warden Av"". I don t know why, the status in H&M page for tracking number says ""refusal by recipient"". This is a joke. Refusal by recipient is completely lie and unrelevant to ""I choose to pick up from Photofast- warden av."" My package currently is in Silver Start Boulevard location waits there for me to come and pick it up?? another joke. Who is responsible for this? the driver? I have received more than 100 packages the last 3 years from H&M and I have excellent relationships when people bring it to me. But oh my gssss with Purolator the last 3 packages with you were nighmare and still is. I have started thinking that the driver is doing it by purpose. I will wait to see finally are you gonna bring it to the right location. I will contact H&M too, it s too much from you, wish they stopped send packages with you. Canada Post works excellent with H&M till now."
"Purolator always "" claimed "" they attempted to have delivered but never actually delivered . They use this tactic because they are too lazy or want to force you to pick it up at one of their locations that are not at a convenient location- then what's the point. Do better Purolator.  There are elderly people who rely on delivery services."
"Not for the first time I am forced to pick up my own parcel because Purolator is one if not the most inept delivery service. They always claim they ""attempted"" to deliver my packages and yet no one has ever buzzed or call to bring up the package. Which means they lie every time I am forced to use their services. Worst of the worst! As for this location? A big bigger might be better since Purolator hardly ever delivers."
I am at my home and my delivery guy left me a note on the door that nobody is home and now I have to pick my document from the Purolator office. I paid for premium delivery at home.Are your delivery guys even trying to deliver the parcel. I am waiting for my document eagerly and this is what you do.I signed up for notifications via SMS but didn't receive any.
Starting to really hate this service. Second time I've ordered something that came by purolator and again the delivery driver didn't call or even leave a tag attempting to make a delivery..I live in a building where the intercom is connected to my cellphone and I haven't received a call from the front door either of times. It is very inconvenient to have to drive 30 minutes from home to pick up a package because there are no pick up locations in the neighborhoods.
"Very bad service, i ordered airpods from amazon, they are supposed to deliver my order before 2 days but they held it for pickup, i don’t understand what is this..? If i have to go for pickup then i would have buyed it from store itself…! Very ridiculous situation and very bad service..! I cant even connect with them properly…! Hope by seeing this review they might deliver my product soon…!##Amazon"
Time and time again they never deliver! They never leave a notice at my door for missing my delivery or even call! I always need to pick up my delivery in person after paying for shipping. Some of the items are heavy hence why I paid extra in the first place! When you call the office you either have to wait 30+ minutes or the line is busy. Thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with the way things are run at this facility.
"The delivery guy dint even call me while delivering my package and left me a note saying we missed you. And the package was almost 20km away from my home. I need to drive there to pickup my package even when I paid extra money for delivery. When I went to pick up my package from their breach I dropped off a package for return to Amazon. The lady at the counter took my package and told me It’s all done. However, on my Amazon account it still shows the drop off is still pending. I tried calling the branch but they don’t have any number listed. The only number listed is customer service number which is taking me forever to get connected. This is not at all professional. How can I trust this company when I can’t even reach someone when required. Any one going to this branch Please make sure they scan your return items in front of you."
"It is so hard to get my package back, they robbed my package and inspected me like a police ask all kinds of ID and address, now I not surprised  so many 1 start complains here for this shop at 90 Silver star rd, once your are not in home, be ready for your frustration to take your package  back, you have to pay extra efforts, time, gas to fight for you own belongs."
"Am I missing something here 🤔, I wasn't home on Sunday when my delivery arrived,  on the note left behind, was stated that the package will be ready for pickup on Monday at the Scarborough silverstar location,  so drove there Monday to get the package,  lady informes me that the driver was just at my house and again no one was there.  So my question to you is why did you make me drive over for nothing? Why didn't the notice say that the package is going to be re delivered ?? This is obviously a very confusing question as the lady at the location could only tell me that she's very sorry for that, I just need an answer here..."
"I came here almost ever week. Since Amazon chose not to work with Canada post anymore. Every time I come, different clerks. But all of them are super nice! Best location ever! But for their service, can’t gave too much info. Because,l lost my iPhone when I was living in downtown many years before using their service. I swear I’ll not come back again. But I have to return my Amazon.🤣🤣🤣"
"The front desk officer was excellent. But this is the third time, I was at home all day but they left a sticker that they didn't find me. They didn't even call me or knock at the door. Their delivery people are just Irresponsible. As a result I have to find time to go to their distribution center to pick up the package. Why? Their delivery people didn't make the effort to deliver the package properly. It is bad"
"Package was finally delivered 2 weeks after the scheduled date. Called customer service and went in person multiple times to resolve the delay, each time being fed false promises of resolution. Once the package was actually delivered, it was immediately noticeable that it was completely destroyed. Wouldn't trust these guys to deliver a bag of s***!"
"Unfortunately this is the closest Purolator shipping center to me, and it isn't good. I've got to pick up or return Amazon orders and staff are always in a hurry and perform haphazard. I ask for receipts and tracking because I always leave unsure if my parcel has actually been prepared and mailed properly.  I'm not asking for a 10 minute conversation,  but if I ask a question, I shouldn't have my item snatched from my hands and a bored ""uh huh"" as my only answer. They assume I know exactly what they're doing, but I don't.  I've yet to have an ok experience, and it's why I don't use this shipping company unless I have to."
The overall experience was great for a return package. I did not get an acknowledgment receipt or email after giving the return item.Date: 2022-09-16Time between 5:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
"Worst service ever, they have a printer there but she refused to print the label and showed me the signboard for a printing shop beside the office to go and print there. When i went that shop they asked me $5 to print the label. I think the receptionist and the shop are mutually beneficial about it.Went there to drop off a Amazon return, first there was no one in the reception, after waiting sometimes the lady came and was was so rude. Not sure why this kind of people can work there. Avoid this place if you can."
"No genuine attempt of delivery at the door. For most of the packages shipped through them, those end up getting picked up from pickup location. Seems like it's a common occurrence of leaving the pickup notice on the door a without actually putting some effort to deliver the package at the door! You can see this from other reviews. I'll probably request my merchant not to use Purolator for any package delivery of mine next time!"
"The driver didn't even come to my door but said there was a delivery attempt. They didn't ring the doorbell or leave a notice. I scheduled a redelivery for both my packages for the next day but only one of them came. I proceeded to spend the next 5 business days trying to track down my other package. Turns out they got the tracking numbers messed up. They continued to track the package I already got and started to count it as my missing package instead of the one that was actually missing. I was in quarantine at the time so I was definitely home and couldn't leave to get the package. Customer service was nice but they didn't get any results at the end of the day. CS tried calling the location (no answer) and tried to schedule redelivery 3 times. Still nothing. Now that my quarantine is over, I can go pick it up but what if it wasn't? I would be without my package AND have wasted hours on the phone with multiple representatives. I hope I can get my package tonight. It is the last day before it gets sent back. What a horrible experience."
There is a reason why we order things online. To be delivered!! Without an attempt they leave a notice that I missed the delivery. I work from home and I was home all day. No one knocked or called edited my delivery preference to call me so I can directly pick up downstairs. No one called! Purolators truck drivers are so lazy to do their job! When they don’t feel like delivering they just write a note no one is home and it’s been like this with company and no one seems to care. Now I have to go further than the actual store to get my package. Worst company
"Worst postal location imaginable. Avoid the torture at all costs if you can. Worth the travel to any other location. The staff here are uneducated and oblivious to any rules stated on the website. Picking up packages at this location takes half an hour or longer every time with a guaranteed hassle by the young female employees. Hopefully Purolator steps up and educates their employees in company policy along with customer service skills. For the price they charge, customer service should be more than non existent."
"Fast, easy and well mannered. Very smooth transaction.The online and the phone service was a waste of time and energy consuming. The text assistant was fast. Took my phone number for scheduling a pickup. No one ever called me back. Also the questions to improve there tech assistant service had so many questions. I just gave up and drove straight to the Purolator Service Center in Scarborough and the job was done under 4 mins. Satisfaction guaranteed only at the service center. Thank you"
I would have 0 stars if possible. I haven’t seen this type of terrible service they are providing.The driver came at my home to drop off the parcel and claims that he knocked the door and tried to call on the given cell number but nobody responded to it.The weird part is I haven’t received any call from unknown calls neither missed any call.Also I don’t think so that he knocked the door or not.Very bad service.NEVER EVER CONSIDERING THIS COURIER SERVICE AGAIN AND WILL RECOMMEND OTHERS TOO TO NOT USE IT.
"They need to start giving receipts for Amazon returns. I was asked to leave the box and told to that since Amazon gives receipts on app, we don't need to give you one. But what if they lost of damaged the product? How do I prove to Amazon that I did my job? This is rediculous and they need to start providing receipts.Response to Vanessa's comment: the person who took the box from me didn't give me that info, they just said you don't get any receipt. The point is that we want some proof that you got the box from us at xyz time, we don't want to track it."
"Got there at 8:20pm so 10 minutes before it closes. Had all my ids ready and there wasn't anyone else there. Presented my tracking number and id's, received my package after 2 minutes or so. Overall great experience. Obviously it depends how busy it is but people need to have more patience and make sure they bring all required information.Also don't show up there untill your tracking number says it is ready to pick up!! They can't give you something that is not there."
This is the 2nd time now that Purolator rang my doorbell and immediately left the 'we've missed you' note without waiting for me. Both times I was at home and they drove off without even waiting a single second. I have a camera on my front door and proof of them doing this. I think they just have those notes ready and leave em to save time and meet their qouta. Purolator must have the worse delivery service compared to the other known companies. Purolator needs to have this checked ASAP because it seems like this is happening to a lot of people.
"I had a very positive experience at this location!Both Michelle and Nicole helped me with my package which didn't arrive on the time stated on my door. No problem. They were outlined a few scenarios of what could have happened and very politely carried a conversation on with me (while stopping, of course to attend other customers)The package in question was something I needed for work, so it was important for me to have it by today - and they got it to me only a few moments later. I enjoyed the positive and friendly interaction I had with both of them. Thanks for the great experience.-Richard"
This is s humble respect.. Please call the person once or send a text at least before you come to deliver. Some people are not at home for the whole day because they got full time jobs. A little notice would actually help a lot so that we will make sure we stay at home rather than getting those pick up slips each and every time which is extremely frustrating!!!
I was being patience and I was waiting for them to come to my house. So they came over and they couldn't wait 15 seconds for me to come to the front door. When I got to the front door I saw a package on the ground but no one was there. At first I thought everything was fine but after I saw the slip on my front door my mood changed. I would be okay if the person left all my packages. But no he only left 1 of my packages. Then I had to waste my time traveling to the office just to pick up my other package. What a great way to ruin someone's day. I think one day we all need to buy an outdoor bench and wait outside in the cold just to make sure that we receive our packages. Cuz they walk away so fast that even if you try to reach them is like chasing a rat on the street.
"The worst service ever... I had 2 packages being delivered with this company. Both packages were picked up by purolator on the same day from the supplier. However they brought only 1 package to my home. When i checked the status of the other package it said ""recipient unavailable"". I was home all day. As to why they separated the package is beyond me. The contents of the package were the same just in 2 separate envelope. I tried calling their customer service. No one answered. I listened that annoying music for 2 hours. I tried using the chat option. That didnt work either. This is the second time i had things shipped to me using their service and no one came or called however they updated it to ""recipient unavailable"" and no notice was left at my door saying that someone came. After which they returned my things to the merchant..... UNACCEPTABLE SERVICE."
"Absolutely avoid if you can. A worker from here called me to schedule a delivery attempt. We agreed on a date and so, someone would be at home to receive my package. Purolator come at an earlier date we did NOT discuss and claim they left my package at my door. I didn't check the delivery status until the agreed upon date because it was end of day and I still got no package. FYI:  the person I spoke to said that the delivery driver will not come up into building residences without buzzers. So how did they get up on a completely different day and leave my package there?My package was NEVER received, it was lost/stolen. Opened up a case and all they can tell me is that it was ""delivered."" They refuse to do anything else... Horrible, horrible service all around from drivers, to customer support and service. There is a reason so many 1 star reviews exist."
My parcel is didnt delievered at home address and it seems far away from my home and i paid the premium fees for that and they didnt call me even for my parcel on my given numberNot satisfied with this kind of service.
"Purolator is not a delivery company. They invented a new business that they hire people to drive around town with tons of packages in their trucks. In the process they pick a few lucky customers to leave a pick up notes. I won lotto free play tickets more than received any package that actually DELIVERED by Purolator. Not even a note. NOT ONCE. I envy those lucky customers who at least get something. I always have to manually track down my package and pick it up at facility. Mankind now have the ability to explore Mars, but Purolator drivers still can't ring a bell, call a buzzer or make a phone call. The one star is solely for the service in Scarborough area. I recall the service was better when I lived in York region."
"One of the worse shipping services I have experienced ever . Horrible service , if you have a choice DO NOT choose them to deliver your package. I paid express shipping to get it the next business day after they got the item . Did not get it the day after.Called to change it so that I could pick it up the next business day since it wasn’t delivered they said that was fine ,they gave me a reference number for the change. Since it was a sensitive issue and I needed to catch my flight I went ahead and went to pick up at 10:30 the Monday morning - package wasn’t there. They sent the package out with a driver when I already called and said I would pick up. Rushed back home before it arrived - if they did and I wasn’t home they would not leave the package cause it is sensitive material . Called to track the driver , they left a note to the driver but there is no guarantee that I get it . Plus they lied and said when I called they said it was no guarantee for the pickup . This was never discussed and I asked several times if I can pick it up , Monday at 10am. Ended up missing my flight."
"Purolator is a complete and utter disaster.  It should be shut down. It took them a week to get a package from Mississauga to Scarborough, and then they refused to deliver it. The tracker says ""Address incomplete or incorrect"". There is nothing incomplete, incorrect or ambiguous about my address. It is a house, the only house with that number on the only street with that name. The number is on the wall of the house in 10-inch high black numbers. I called at 6:30 am to ""correct"" the perfectly correct addess. They told me it would take some time to ""process"" the correction and that it was too late to make it on the truck for delivery that day. Total complete failure of a joke of a nightmare. Farcical really."
"Worst experience at Purolator in Canada ever, will never go to this location again. The front desk admin is very disrespectful and unprofessinal. I arraived at the parking lot almost at the same time with a gentleman and I walked to the drop off office before him. Apparently this is first time to go to this location for both him and myself, we stepped into an ""employee only entrance"" at the same time again. One employee came out and pointed us to the correct direction, this time that gentleman was one step ahead of me but we were literally walking to the office together. The gentleman is nice, he opened and held the door for me, I said thank you then I stepped in and standing before him.  When the front desk admin came out from the inside office, she said to my face directly ""he is ahead of you"". I was surprised and asked ""what?"", she repeated herself and this time I understood she wants to help that gentleman first. I did not argue since I am running out of time in the morning so I asked the man to go first. Honestly, the whole drop off process for both him and myself only took less than 2 mins in total. When is my turn, she said "" I don't know what happend, but he came in first"". As a professinal employee who represents for Puralator,  IF YOU DO NOT KNOW OR COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE WHOLE STORY, PLEASE SHOW SOME RESPECT TO OTHERS AND STAY QUIET. You made me like a person who cut off the line and you did not even ask before criticizing me. If I cut off the line, he will said it to my face instead of you. You have no right to criticize me in front of others especially when you admitted ""I do not know what happened between you"". I just became angrier and angrier after this happened and you ruined my day. Puralator may not care for one tiny customer like me, but please, AT LEAST show some repsect to others and do not judge or comment withought knowing the whole story."
These guys can’t call themselves a courier service. The package that was supposed to be delivered from Marks Work Warehouse was brought to a pickup center over 20 km from the shipping address. The customer service line couldn’t answer why the delivery was unsuccessful. I never received an email notification or delivery notice at my door. I refuse to pick up something that I paid shipping for. This is unbelievable and unacceptable.
"The delivery team failed to get the package to me because they refuse to call or notify you in advance since they supposedly don’t carry work phones. The package was too far for pick up, so I asked support to move it closer. The customer support supposedly moved the package closer for pick up. However, upon arriving on the date it was scheduled to be there, the package was no where to be seen. Then I contacted customer support once again. I was told that there was some error, then it was supposedly moved again. Hours later I get an email telling me that the wrong area had received it.  Haven’t seen a distributor with such an awful chain of communication. Your package will simply be tossed around like a pinball all over the place and never reach its proper destination.  I pray for everyone’s sake that you don’t get them as your carrier."
"There is an obnoxious braided blondie Karen there. She is quite scary, rude and condescending. She needs to have some strong cuppa tea or coffee or even a good amount of ice-cream, for she is too grumpy and sour of attitude. If you are an immigrant and you go there, shame on ye but hey, if you are in her line, you might as well just leave. 😂🤣 That is all i will say because there is no point explaining the details here. What happened today is known to me, God and one other good and polite employee but thanks to that rotten apple, nay, egg of an employee that is said braided blondie Karen, i will choose a much closer Purolator henceforth than this, should I require Purolator for amazon returns.I hope, amazon would resume giving options for good ol' Canada Post and UPS, just as it used to in the good ol' simpler days."
"Got a message from Purolator telling me they have a package for me and the driver couldn't deliver it, please call.When I called, they said there was ""an issue with the address"" (I knew there wasn't) and I would have to be home between 8am and 8pm to receive it when they re-deliver. I mentioned if they deliver anytime after 2pm my building has a concierge to drop it off with. They didn't care. The other options I was informed of were that I would have to either pick it up from the nearest location (2 hours round trip on the bus from me) or they would send it back as I couldn't guarantee I'd be home when they delivered.Since it's 2016 and it's a totally ridiculous notion to sit at home for 12 hours waiting for a package to be delivered, I opted to waste just the 2 hours and go pick it up.When I got there I asked the lady serving me once more ""why was this package not delivered?"" She looked into the computer and said ""because the driver didn't have a buzzer code"".  I said ""well, that's ridiculous"" (because I knew that the buzzers were listed alphabetically by NAME) and sure enough... didn't the lady, with absolutely zero emotion look at me and say ""why, was it your name?"" She said again with zero emotion, ""I hear that all the time, you can call and complain if you want to"". That was it. No empathy, no apology, no ""we'll speak to the drivers about that."" Just yep, basically our drivers don't care and we know this because it happens all the time but clearly we don't care either because nobody is doing anything about this.So here I am, the SIXTY-SEVENTH NEGATIVE REVIEW of this awful business. But remember, she told me I can call and complain... as if I'd be so eager to waste even more of my time with these people.I'll pass on that, but what I will do is contact the huge company I ordered my package from and share this review so they can see what Purolator thinks of their business and its customers.What a miserable company to do business with!!!"
Completely useless. My item was shipped without the unit number so it was undeliverable. Yet they tried to deliver it 2 days in a row. Called the customer service line multiple times and got a different answer every time. Some said they would change the address some said they couldn't. Employees definitely need training. An employee told me I need to contact the company that shipped the item in order to change the address. They even offered to give me the phone number to the company....except they gave me a number for a completely different company.
"Purolator are by far the worst shipping company I've ever dealt with. They absolutely refuse scheduled delivery even though I work 9-5 and literally cannot be home when they deliver. There are times when I HAVE been home and they didn't attempt a delivery, just left a slip. Once they never notified me at all that they had my package, no email or call or delivery slip. I only found out by checking my tracking email from the vendor that they'd already had my package for 5 days and returned it to sender!! They sent it back without even notifying me that they had it. Absolutely piss poor service. Oh and once I asked them to send my package to a drop off point closer to me since their main location is extremely far from me by public transit. When I picked up my package it had been completely smashed, their secondary location had it piled under other much heavier boxes. Never again will I buy from a vendor that ships via Purolator. Amazon, FedEx, UPS, and even Canada Post are all far superior."
"I was home when they attempted delivery, June 19 9:17 am, no buzzer, no knock on the door and no notes, tried calling the customer service disconnected after 15 minutes of waiting, so I called the customer service I bought my product from, and they said it will be shipped on Monday. Which is tomorrow, now I received an email saying my product is ready for pickup, but tracking doesn’t say where.“ the worst shipping service in Canada”"
"Hello,    Please, i have had an extremely terrible experience with my order to be delivered. It was very late and also i had to arrange a car go and pick it up from far away from Purolator branch. It was never delivered to me and never recieved any calls or sticker left at my door. I do not appreciate this after paying to be delivered at my door. As it is very frustrating to go through all this to go and get my parcel myself. If i wanted to go out i would have just gone to the store to buy my stuff. After my on chat with customer service they assured me that the will  deliver it to me next day for that i have them full stars n everything as they asked review right away bit in real it was poor as there was no help. which was never done instead i kept recieving emails that my package will be returned if i don't pickup soon from a further away purolator office. Risking my life i extra to uber back n forth for that. Worst experience ever."
"Terrible service! The people and system are extremely unorganized.1) They do not ask for the apartment buzzer code and then show up on the day of delivery and leave. Do not even look up your name in the list, nor contact you with the provided cell phone number.2) I updated my buzzer code and set a new delivery date, then stayed home all day, and they didn’t show up again! Reason: my information was not updated in their system!!3) After everything, I had to pick up the parcel myself. Went on a Sunday because their Google Maps info clearly showed they were open. Reached there, they were closed.Overall, extremely dissatisfied with the service. Would not recommend"
"Just had the most horrendous experience today with this location like wow! Had to walk out, could NOT deal with the incompetence level. So the driver could NOT find My place and then they did NOT scan the box when they returned and their answer was, ""Sorry we can't find Your package but You can call a 1888--- number to but a trace on it"", Are You freaking kidding Me, so one of the driver's/employee can't scan a package and now it's My problem? I think NOT.... I would give zero stars if I could, this place needs an overhaul badly....I would NOT recommend this place unless You want a lost package...."
This is the only delivery company whose package almost never reaches my place. They are not bothered about delivering the package or have any customer empathy. They do not make an honest attempt to ever deliver any package.  I had to return my amazon ordered items a few times now since these guys did'nt have it delivered. Never had any issue with any other delivery company. Worst delivery service.
"Was home all day and the driver left the package at my door without ringing the doorbell or knocking. Didn't even realize the package was sitting out front, while it was raining, until my brother left the house later in the afternoon. Thankfully the package wasn't damaged in the rain.Had to pick up another package at this location. I got there an hour after they opened and had to wait 10 minutes, even though I was the only person there, just because the employees were busy chatting with each other."
"I took the day off expecting to receive my order as per their tracking system. They decided in the afternoon that my order was “undeliverable” because it’s too heavy. Makes me wonder how this company operates. Had they not known there was a “heavy” item going out for delivery when they loaded it onto the truck? So should they not have made arrangements accordingly? It’s very disappointing that they didn’t try to contact me about it either, no knock on the door or phone call so I just made myself available for the delivery all day for nothing.I then contacted this location in regards to my order and they asked me to pick it up myself. I personally chose to have my package delivered to my home so I can avoid driving out myself to pick it up. So now they’ve arranged for a 2 men delivery truck this Friday to make the delivery. Let’s hope they actually try to deliver it this time around."
The delivery man just put a notice on the door without trying to deliver the item. It weighs 50 pounds and it must be too heavy for him. There was no attempt for second delivery and I was requested to go to the store for pick-up. I live in Markham and at the end I have to drive 40 minutes to Scarborough. After I picked up the item an email was sent confirming they delivered  it.  What a joke!  The customer has to do everything and they actually have the work ethics claiming the credit.
"Customer service at this location is friendly but they're usually having technical problems and can't find the package. My biggest problem is with the delivery drivers. They will make absolutely no attempt to enter the condo using the buzzer code. Every other delivery driver from Amazon doesn't have a problem, only Purolator. I have to come to this pickup location everytime. If your package is being delivered by Purolator, expect delays and running around wasting your time."
"Not sure why this courier does not rearrange delivery if they failed to deliver. No one will be at home on weekdays if you work full-time. What is the point of online shopping if the courier cannot deliver heavy items to your door? Now I have to ask my friend to drive me for pick-up since I don't drive. Also I will never do online shopping as long as they use this courier. Simply the worst. Plus I noticed that ""local guide"" left some ""good review"" here but needless to say they get paid or incentive to write good reviews so don't trust them."
This place does not have the best location and they have a small parking area.Nonetheless they have pleasant front counter staff who are very helpful and respectful. Despite the company do not offer a top-notch customer service it was a pleasant experience.My major issue is with the delivery service as the delivery guys come to your door and leave notices rather than knocking or pressing your doorbell. I find this practice to be unprofessional and I is causing a huge inconvenience to several customers who all complain about being home all day and being surprise to find a notice of delivery guy passing.I think the delivery service needs to be improved because it's causing a huge inconvenience and even when the drivers return your package to the location  the items are left on the trucks rather than being offload in the warehouse. Due to this practice customers have to wait for a long period of time to get their items
Worst customer service ever experienced with Purolator. Suppose get a shipment on Thursday and the date changed to Friday. Later found out delivery attempt made and went to check any notice but there was none. Checked my security camera and there was no attempt made. Just lied.. call customer service and took 1 hour still no luck. Now it’s unavailable to deliver. Receiver closed. What nonsense. Called so many times to customer service and they don’t know what’s happening either. Today is Tuesday and still no luck. All they said was keep checking ur tracking and after few days it will say ready to pick up. I am really confused. They don’t even know what they r doing!!Just unacceptable.
"I would give this a minus star if it were available.  I ordered a large item from Best Buy, who uses Purolator as their delivery service.  I called them 5 times to schedule an evening delivery (as per instructions from an employee at their depot), and each time the driver showed up between noon and 2pm.  I rushed home from work to ensure I'd be there for the delivery and again, there was a notice.I called their customer service yesterday and was told that they would contact the driver and the depot to set up another delivery date.  No one called.  I called again today to find out there is no delivery scheduled for today.  They gave me a reference number to escalate this if the depot didn't call me to and again, no call.  I was also informed that the depot is probably putting the package on a delivery truck where the driver only works days.I've gotten so frustrated with Purolator time and time again that my husband and I have decided that we will not place an online order if the delivery service will be Purolator.  You'd think that with so many negative reviews, something would be done to better train the employees and drivers..."
"Package was supposed to be delivered on Friday. They came by and left a note saying it was taken back to the facility, with a date written on it for when I can go pick it up. The date said the next morning, Saturday, at 9 am. We show up to the Scarborough location, as noted on the slip, and turns out they were closed for the whole weekend. Wasted my time and gas to drive there for nothing and now I still won't have my package until probably Tuesday or Wednesday. The whole thing is extremely frustrating."
"So I was expected to receive my packages two weeks ago, but due to the operating hours of my business (evening), Purolator doesn't seem to deliver that late.  As an alternative, I requested an address change to my home address on June 22nd.  The CSR assured that it will probably take a day or two to arrive.  When that day passed I called again, they said it should arrive the following day.On June 25th, I contacted their customer service line a 3rd time.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  The gentleman I spoke to said that he will look into the case personally and said that I should expect to receive the parcel on June 26th, but no later than today (June 29th).Well, I am checking the status of my shipment and I see no updates since Thursday.  I try calling today, but I keep getting disconnected.  I resort to live chat and was told that they will get to it as soon as possible.  Really frustrating...if they were more forthcoming and said that we have absolutely no clue when this will come, I would have sooner told them to leave it at the depot and I pick it up.Now my order is currently in limbo with no ETA on when I should be getting it.  If I request pick-up, apparently there is no guarantee that I can even pick it up today either....terrible customer service."
ALWAYS have an issue with delivery of my packages.   My name and Apt # are on the buzzer.   Yet no one buzzes and they say incomplete address.My products have been sitting in the heat for 4 days at a depot 30 minutes from my house.  Customer service really wants to help but the depots are the ones that need the help.   I will be going today to speak to a depot manager again!   This is ridiculous.  I also never get door tags so I have no idea what's going on if I cant log on and look online.   Brutal delivery service
"Today is the third situation with Purolator. I had an issue with them just few weeks ago. Then, with the current package I am waiting for and after two weeks, they told me they returned back to the sender as they came and nobody although I called them 3 days ago to pick up,  but they told me that they will deliver in 1 to 2 days. Anyway,  I filed a complaint with them, but I don't expect much from a negligent courier company. If the company doesn't care for customers,  don't expect much from them."
"Spoke to several representatives who all stated that delivery would be Monday at the earliest. Requested them to hold package and was told due to covid they wouldn’t be able to hold, pull, or locate package to due back log. Found a notice on my door later that afternoon stating they had attempted delivery and they would now be holding package for 5 days, called back and was told that now delivery would be Wednesday-Thursday at the earliest. Only delivery company requiring a signature at this time and the lack of information after multiple calls is infuriating. Avoid Purolator at all costs if you’d like to receive your package in a timely manner."
"Worst carrier! Bad experience with 2 packages.First box from walmart was totally broken and i had to throw away the baby food inside because it fell out and looks dirty. I don't feel safe to feed that to my baby.For the second package, the driver never attempted to ring the bell or knock and left the note at the door saying no one is home, while my ENTIRE family, 5 PEOPLE are all inside the house!!!!   I have to drive half an hour in this pandemic to pick it up when there is vulnerable people in the household and the whole reason that i shop online was to avoid going out!Next time before i shop I will ask what carrier they use and will NEVER put an order if they use purolator."
"Fantastic service, reliable and predictable.  My best business partner and could not function without  them.My regular driver, Rob is super, he accommodates my requests and always has a big smile !The staff at this location are the best.  They work so hard and always maintain their composure no matter what the clients throw at them.This location, which is a warehouse and open later than the usual drop  off points."
"After a failed ""delivery attempt"" (which was baffling to begin with since I was home all day and I have dog that barks anytime someone approaches the house, these Purolator delivery drivers must be ninjas), I was forced to go to this Purolator location.The disorganization here is incredible to behold, especially for a company that prides themselves with logistics. The lady at the front desk took my slip and had to ask what size the package was so that the lady ""rooting through the bins"" would be able to find it. I am not making this up... It's as if they have no system in place to organize and sort parcel pick-up.25 minutes later, I am still waiting in my car for my package. Gave me enough time to write a review, at least.Do NOT use Purolator for any delivery in the Scarborough area."
"The worst delivery company in Canada, period. Delivery drivers always lie saying the address is incorrect, buzzer code unavailable, no one to sign and a whole host of other reasons to ensure they don't deliver packages. Specially the case for large packages. I receive packages from Canada post, FedEx and uber flex with no issues at all to my address and the buzzer code for the building is clearly stated in the vestibule if they even bothered to look. I guess they don't even come into the building with the package so of course they would not notice the plaque with the buzzer info."
"The  whole city is locked down and you tell me nobody at home. Well done and thanks to you that people have to go out facing  the virus.Simply drop the box might save my life and Purolator choose to disagree government suggestion.I feel  so sorry to those pick up point clerks that they have no masks to wear, your  company 's notice- delivery-only drivers put you all in danger."
"The courier arrived at our door and my sister being the only one at home at the time was in the washroom. She rushed out as soon as she could but the courier didn't even bother to wait a few moments. Now, just like most of these other reviews – I will have to make the long and unnecessary trip to their warehouse just because the courier didn't show a lick of patience. What are your policies regarding multiple delivery attempts – even Canada Post tries at least 2-3 times before leaving it at an outlet for pick up ...Shame, there's no option for 0 stars.Edit: This review and rating only applies to that horrible driver. The staff at the shipping office were very kind and helpful. Keep up the good work!"
"One of the most pathetic delivery services I have ever experienced.1. Without any intimation, the delivery was randomly attempted at my apartment. Though I was home throughout the day, I did not get any call, no buzzer ring, no delivery attempt note was even left in the mailbox or with building security etc. When I checked the status a few days later, it mentioned ""Receiver not available"".2. So I messaged on their Live Chat - the agent could only show me the same note ""Receiver not available"" and told me that their delivery agents do not have phones to contact the Receiver. And I kept wondering as to how that's possible in today's world.3. Called the Contact Centre to check - got some very rude responses as to - ""There is no buzzer code on your file"", ""There are no delivery instructions on your file"", ""We don't give cellphones to our agents"", ""Any delivery issues need to be managed between the shipper and the receiver"" etc. Again, I am thinking all the other delivery agencies - never faced any issues ever with anyone at all.Only saving grace, they said that they can attempt re-delivery - but I decided I will pick up myself.I will also contact the online portal from where I had made the purchase to let them know of feedback and that they should look into their business relationship with Purolator."
"I hate how they get to where you are and they don't even leave a note, you have to discover that they attempted to deliver by tracking online, or receiving a call from them saying they tried to deliver but there was no one. I would recommend other companies not to even try to use them, the customer service also they need to learn English and give straight answers, I had to call like 3 times to get one answer to a question. they need to either hire English fluent or train their customer service. even the 1 star they don't deserve it. I went through hell to get my package, yet even to pick up your package you have to wait for their phone call to go pick it up.. I would never ever deal with them again."
"My dissatisfaction for this company is very high. My package was scheduled to arrive on a Tuesday, and I even checked my tracking # online to be sure that I had the right date. I patiently sat in my living room, waiting for my doorbell to ring. The online tracking # showed that my package left the warehouse at 8AM for delivery and it was going to arrive anytime on that same day. When the clock hit 5PM and my package has still not arrived, I checked my tracking # again and it states: ATTEMPTED DELIVERY - RECEIVER UNAVAILABLE. Well, let's see.. uhm I was home the entire day. Literally, the door was three metres away from where I was sitting. I didn't hear my doorbell ring. I didn't hear anyone knock. What the hell happened? It was like the Purolator driver did not make any attempt to deliver my package! As proof, if he did attempt to deliver my shipment, he would've left a note. BUT, guess what, he did not. There was no doorbell, no knock, no note. As if my house address is totally nonexistent. I talked to the online corresponder on chat and she was very nice to me and filed a complaint on my behalf.  She said I would receive a call regarding my complaint but I never did. This happened around two weeks ago. Is my complaint just brushed under the rug? Very disappointing."
"AVOID IF YOU CAN! Lost a package, twice. But online they claimed it was ""delivered"". I've had hundred of packages through Canada Post delivered fine. If you called them to figure out where the package is they'll make you wait 25-45 minutes to tell you they will call you back with more information, which they never would! A scam of a delivery service!"
"I HATE YOU GUYS WITH A PASSION!!!!!!!Today, Feb 25, I was suppose to have a re-delivery because I had abdominal surgery on Monday, Feb 23, 2015 and was expecting a package for Tuesday, Feb 24. 2015. Yesterday, Feb 24, 2015, I put a note on the door, informing the driver that ""I am home, please, be patient with me, I had surgery, I'm on my couch, please don't leave."" On Feb 24, the driver was knocking, and I called out to the driver to please wait, trying my best to make it to the front door... WRONG! By the time I got to the door, he left a FREAKING 'WE MISS YOU NOTE!'So, I immediately called Purolator (at 10am) and requested for a re-delivery, which was supposed to be done today, Wednesday, Feb 25, 2015. Now, I am sitting in my kitchen, in immense pain, waiting for the driver to delivery my package, which I was told that the driver will be delivering this morning. WRONG! I looked up on my tracking number, and the depot STILL HAS THE REQUEST FOR ME TO PICK UP!I just called customer service, I found out that the depot didn't even process the order, my request for re-delivery was never done! I spoke to a supervisor, and she told me that there was nothing she can do because the driver is already out on the road, and his orders for today had already been processed! And I have another day for the driver to re-deliver a package that was supposed to be delivered now! So, after sitting in pain for two hours, waiting, ripping my stitches, and I have spoken to a supervisor, nothing can be done until tomorrow. The supervisor told me that a complaint on this lazy ass depot will be filed, but I don't believe it! And what the driver did to me yesterday, do you honestly believe that your driver will deliver my package, since he didn't wait when I called out to him????You Asswipes are ridiculous!  I DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS REQUIRED (BY YOUR COMPANY) ON MY END, AT LEAST YOU CAN DO YOUR FREAKING JOBS! Save your fake apologies for someone else, because I'm not having it!"
Got a voicemail from this number asking me to provide additional information needed to deliver my package. I was asked to call back Purolator customer support centre.At first I hoped they would call me again. But nope. No further calls.So I start calling myself. With couple of calls each more than an hour waiting time  each I am still not able to reach Purolator representatives..I tried to track the package with the number they provide me but do not see anything.No idea what is the package they call me about. Probably I would never learn this.
"The worst company ever to deliver a package. Driver knocked once and only once ( knock), I ran to the door and the driver took off and saw me running after the truck. I paid for their service of delivery ($40) and I will still have to pick up the pacakage from a depot. I feel like I flushed my money down the drain. I called three times today to get a track on weather or not the driver will be back and was told that they attempted to page him and they will not know if he will be back to get my package. I am furious, I am led to believe that the driver did not want to deliver the package from the start as the pacakage weighs 49lbs. Simply the worst service from a multi billion dollar company whose sole purpose is to deliver pacakages, what a waste of time. I was told that someone from the shipping depot will get back to me in 48 hours. Avoid at all cost honestly avoid at all cost because they cannot fulfill their end of the agreement but will take your money in addition all their positive feedback is fake, no one with good service takes the time to let the world know how good a service is people who feel wronged will do anything to stop other from being wronged, this is a horrible company."
"Absolutely terrible service. I received a lot of packages by Canada Post and FedEx, but only Purolator lies about wrong address and other problems to not deliver packages. Even no notice about pick up. They force you to call them and find out where your package is by yourself. And then they want you to go to their office that is situated far-far away to get your parcel by yourself. Will never use their services again!"
"I would not recommend this company to anyone. I have missed a delivery attempt from them due to the time of the shipment  (12pm on a weekday) Who is home at that time? So I requested a 2nd delivery. Their poor customer service made me wait 48 hours for this. Most private carriers arrange a 2nd delivery on the next business day without hassle. I will never ever rely on this courier going forward. Have had great experiences with UPS, Fedex, Loomis and Canpar."
"Very lazy & incompetent package delivery driver (June 23, 2020 Amazon delivery)My buzzer is currently out of order so i wrote a note saying to please call my cell upon arrival so i can open the lobby door on a bright orange sticky pad and placed it right next to the buzzer console.The driver ignored it and placed a note next to the console saying ""Sorry we missed you"".So now i have to waste my time and gas to go all the way to the Purolator pick center to get my package.Wasted a whole day waiting.Very bad customer service."
"gonna post this everywhere i can so no one makes the same mistake i madeI have been told to never talk trash about anybody because they are good people who made mistakes, so I never make a review on google maps because I never have anything good to say, so I keep my mouth shut but never in my life have I been played so badly that I wanna do something. I am beyond outraged that this thing you call a company lost my package, and it is not any other package. it was a keyboard I saved up for. I had to save my lunch money (i go to high school) for 3 months just to get this keyboard and mouse combo. I even paid for 2-day shipping and told everyone that I was gonna upgrade for once. but oh boy was a wrong. at first, it took 3 days to get my package shipped and I was okay with that. then it takes the package a day to get onboard a plane/get to an airport. fine with that sure, takes two days to get to Toronto, I was mad and upset but at last, it was in Toronto I said to my self (oh boy was I wrong) then after a day guess what? rescheduled for the next business day! I was even more upset but I was okay with that sure, then rescheduled for the next business day. I cried that day, not sleeping just to get my package on time. after a week it ""On vehicle for delivery"" and after a day it arrived... after that, I never heard about it again and it was lost forever in storage. I learned something though, never ship with Purolator and tell the shipper to never use Purolator again. so right now I don't mind if you help me because I still want my package but aside from that I would never recommend this service and even to the people I hate the most."
"Absolutely terrible delivery service for the 4th time, always an inconvenience. I was home all day waiting for my package no one called nor did I  even see any delivery trucks out, even checked my security camera's to see if i had missed it but nothing. It's always ends cost you more to go out of your way to a delivery center that the hours are not convenient."
"I have only been to one of their facilities in Scarborough, Toronto, ON Canada. Service was fast. Social distancing is properly maintained. Hand sanitizer was present. Lines were maintained.Two improvement areas: one, a new comer can't find where the main office door is aa there is no clear sign for customer entryTwo, once they give you the baggage with the wheeled carrier, you don't know where to park/ place it after you have successfully put your baggage on your vehicle. So it gets confusing, for someone who has no personal vehicle."
"I there was nothing I liked about the service,  they said they tried to deliver on 12/17 they left a slip saying where it can be picked up so I called so they can deliver again on December 24 they said not a problem gave me a confirmation number. Today December 24 I called @ 230 just to confirm it is on a truck to be delivered.  NOPE they did not put it on a truck to be delivered.  They say there is nothing they can do about it.  They could deliver December 29 but that is after Christmas.  No compensation or anything except,  We can't do anything about it!!  Talk about Great customer service!!!!"
Am I the only one that has had a great experience? I missed my delivery of a TV I bought from BestBuy. I expected to have to go and pick it up. Later on during the same day my doorbell rang and the driver came back. He said he was at the end of his rounds and thought he would try again. He wanted to make sure I had my TV for the weekend.
"The most awful experience with delivery services!!! Do not ever use it!!! I have scheduled the re delivery for today, took a day off and it never came!!! And it wouldn't come tomorrow because it's weekend and there is no re-delivery service on the weekend. So now I would probably need to stay at home for another day! Customer service Joey was polite on the phone and tried to help but mentioned that he can not tell me the exact delivery day. What reliable logistics company can not track the package??? - PUROLATOR, except it is not reliable at all! So disappointing and frustrating!!! My $2000 package just in the middle of nowhere."
"Terrible service from PurolatorFirst of all, all the deliveries Amazon, Can Post, DHL, Fedex all shipper leave the item in the porch. Purolator left a note to pick up the item, Called last night, was advised to pick this from pickup location. I went this morning 90 Silverstar Blvd, scarb (the location), the item is not there. what is the point of shipping when they fail to deliver basic service?No other shipping company in Canada gave me that trouble ever."
"The moment I got notification from canadaluggagedepot.ca it's purolator, my heard sinked, they shipped two packages in total, and none of them are delivered on-time, so I have to schedule a pick up which is 16km away- First package was marked with wrong address, correction made and no delivery attempt again, as well as not available for pick up- Second package was attempted for delivery, the problem is i was starring at my door for entire day without any luck seeing them. By EOD, my wife came in and see a notice ... fine, I called them immeimdately and schedule for another delivery, the service rep wrote down the note, guess what next day? it's available for pick upDespite both packages were marked as no signature required, none of them have been delivered yet, it takes them days to schedule something to pick up from store even, I just don't get it... if I were working like this in any company, I would have been fired"
"Order something from Amazon, they ship it with these clowns. I was home all day on the day I was suppose to get the delivery, but delivery never came. I contact Amazon after 3 days and they tell me that Purolator tried to deliver but I wasn't home. I check when they said they attempted, what do you know, of course I was home. The lazy ass driver didn't want to do his/her/it's job so he/she/it never bothered to even show up at my building. If an attempt had been made and I wasn't home then he/she/it would have left a note saying he/she/it missed me with an instruction for a pickup location.And to top it off, this is the 5th time this had happened to me. I guess I have to avoid them by not buying stuff from vendors who ship through them.Wish vendors would stop using them or a big company like Amazon cancel their contract so they can clean up their act."
"There is obviously something wrong with this company judging by the POOR reviews. I was told they would redeliver my package the following day. I asked them if they could give me a time frame of a few hours and they said they couldn't and that it could be anywhere from morning to evening (like, seriously?). Regardless, I stayed home. AND NOTHING CAME. On top of it all, the guy on the phone wasn't pleasant to talk to. I was warned about the poor customer service and delivery service and it was unfortunately proven true by this recent experience. Make sure you ask companies in advance if they will be using Purolator to deliver because if that's the case, try to get out of it. You might end up having to trek across the city to pick up your package or having to wait around all day for nothing."
Please try to avoid any services from purolator as they are the most irresponsible company in this industry. I paid for the pick up and drop off and when the driver came he just knocked the door and left me an the to pick up the package from their location. When I called them they told me that the driver don’t have the provision to call the customer. Since we paid for a service we have to receive it.
Awful service and rude staff. This location sucks. Purolator in general is the worst. My address on my package clearly said the buzzer code number yet when I check online to track my shipment it says driver didn't have entry code. This company is full of inefficient staff. Drivers are lazy and liars. Don't even attempt to make the delivery. When you call to complain they make it seems like it's the customers fault somehow. Never had a good experience dealing with Purolator. If I could I would rate them zero.
"Unbelievably terrible service. I had a parcel on express for the 15th of July, and it was delayed to next Monday. It would have been guaranteed for the 15th, but the company decided to lift its guarantee due to increased volume, as a result of potential Canada Post strikes. The guarantee was also suspended more than two weeks before I was to receive my package. One would like to think if a company is expecting increased volume, they would increase service. I called to see if I could pick up the package in person, since this was meant to be a gift, and the tracking had stated it was delayed in Toronto. After over an hour on hold, I was told it was inaccessible because they didn't know which truck it was on. How do you not know what you have on each truck? Either your process for shipping is terribly inefficient, or you are just lazy."
I will give no star if I can. Just because the package is heavy(89lb) they try their everything not to deliver it. Customer service is useless. A woman said they will call in the next day but no one did that. Another guy his name is mike said that the only way to deliver it is I pick up the phone and arrange the time. So people have no cell phone are not qualified to use their “service”. He said they will call in 24 to 48 hours so I have to focus on the phone for that long. No specific time no other way to contact them. Now I have to rent a truck and pick it up by myself. It’s been two weeks! Two weeks!  I strongly recommend bestbuy do not work with them. Shame on u purolator.
"I paid for express shipping when I purchased my item and was checking the status every 30 minutes.  When I placed the order, I specifically included my buzzer, cell number and a note saying they can leave it with concierge downstairs.  At 14:00 I click update and I notice the driver tried to deliver at 13:36 and 13:40 and was unable to reach me.  I quickly called Purolator and told them I've been waiting all day for this package.  The lady on the phone (Joanne) was not sympathetic at all.In fact, she said the company that prepared the way-bill did not leave a buzzer number or a note to leave the package with concierge downstairs. I was obviously upset and all she said was ""go pick up the package from our depot after 6PM""...I have received SEVERAL packages and never had this type of a problem.  She was actually quite condescending and explained that their drivers don't carry phones and don't call customers. If she had just apologized and offered me some options, I probably would have been happy.I will NEVER EVER use Purolator."
"I've never had a good experience with Purolator and believe me, I never pick them by choice. I've had to go pick it up my packages myself every time because the courier has always had some excuse or other. The specific instance that caused me to write this review is that the driver chose to decline delivery due to a lack of entry code even though he had my name and the directory was RIGHT THERE IN THE LOBBY. I've never had to explicitly provide an entry code to any other shipping company and they still manage to look me up. So much for free shipping when I have to take time and resources to go pick it up myself even though my package was probably less than a couple hundred feet from me this morning."
"Horrible, completely unprofessional company. I waited all day for a delivery and they left the note on the door. So I go to the location in Markham it said to pick it up just to be told the driver screwed up and sent it to the Scarborough depot (I live nowhere near Scarborough). They told me they'll ""try"" to deliver it 4 days from now and the only way they ""might"" leave my package at my door is if I write a long ass note authorizing the driver to do so. If not I have to go to Scarborough."
Staff are sweet and caring.One of them (she had blonde hair) actually picked up my package and put it in my car after I casually told the other staff that I had an injury to my back and I wanted to know how heavy my package was. Thank you so much for going the extra mile!!
"It was horrible nobody came to my apartment.  There was no buzzing, nobody came to deliver it upstairs and no one left a note for me to take to them either. All I got was a voicemail mentioning my parcel is waiting for me at the nearest purolator location. Because of that I had to wait over the weekend for my package.  And no one called me ever again to ask if I wanted another delivery attempt.They are unprofessional unwelcoming and rude on the phone.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who needs university textbooks delivered by them."
They did not deliver to my house because they were too lazy to walk 50 meters or they were too dumb to use a GPS to find the address. Then they told me they would re-deliver the next day and did not. Now my package is stuck in purolator purgatory and they will not even answer my calls. STAY AWAY! If you're buying goods from a company that ships with them ask for alternatives!
Their workers are very lazy and it is the worse i have ever experience.Imagine i ordered a stroller from babies r us and it was to be delivered at my place after sitting at home looking out my window and miss my appointment and my baby will be here any day now. No one shows up when i call they are saying someone came and I was not home the lies those lazy workers tell it's amazing.
Very quick and friendly location. I missed the delivery driver and took the notice without checking the date. We went in and we were told that it wasn't available till the next day as it shows on the slip. The staff was nice about it and even suggested it could come in later tonight after the driver is done with his route. She told us to track it and we could pick it up once it says it's back. We went and ate at the plaza near Midland and finch. After I was done I tracked it and it said it was at the Purolator office so i picked it up. Thanks for the advice!
"I have had such bad experiences in the past with Purolator and inappropriate responses. Every single time a package is heavy, I would not be surprised to notice ""undelivered"" on the tracking system with no knock on the door. Reasons are address change, person not available.While the same address works flawlessly for smaller packages. That's funny !Upon enquiring, my security guard informed that ""whenever the package is heavy, they take it back - indicating person was not available, or no access - because they do not want to deliver it to the door""I hate it when amazon sends my packages through Purolator, because I have to call - hold the package - visit the terminal - pick it up myself. EVERY SINGLE TIME !I WILL NOT RECOMMEND PUROLATOR TO ANYONE !"
"Purolator didn't deliver my package because they said they needed an entry code. My building doesn't have an entry code, one simply needs to use their hands and pull open the door. I then called their call centre to fix the matter and the employee was rude and acted as if it was my fault and said there should be a note on the door stating the building doesn't have an entry code, which doesn't make sense to me. I later complained to a manager about her attitude. Very unimpressed with this ordeal and am simply driving to the location to get my package because they are obviously incompetent."
"Being home the whole day (flu), I can say for certain that i would notice if someone knocked on my door. Purolator however, stated that not only they tried delivering it once, but twice! Of course they said i ""unavailable""  for both of those times. This delivery were for RAM sticks so it was small enough to fit inside the apartment's mail slots but instead they decided to make it available to pick up. So instead of getting the service i paid for, I had to trudge my way here to pick up something that could've been delivered if they actually did their job. The greatest part is that they don't even try to compensate for their performance. Thanks for the ""service""."
"Absolutely hands down the worst experience I have ever had with a delivery company.  I get delivries every single day from all the major delivery companies.  Purolator is the only one run and staffed by a bunch of morons, who not only can't follow instructions, but don't know their own company policies from  a hole in the wall.They have been jerking me around for over a week now. First they show up to deliver a package, don't ring the buzzer, even though I requested that, and now want me to go to the depot to pick up the package.  I don't drive and your depot is not centrally located or easily accessible for those without a car.Then I call to have my package redirected to my work address. First I'm told that there will be a fee.  So I need to pay a second 'delivery' fee on top of the one I paid to have the package delivered originally.  This fee is because it is two different delivery areas.  Then I'm told I don't need to pay a fee.  Then I'm told once again that I do need to pay a fee.  Make up your freaking me.  I will pay the damned fee if I have to, I just want my package.  Then you have to sit around and wait for the depot to call you after CS sends a message to them about the re-direction.  Tried calling the depot to pay the fee, but their phone system doesn't allow you to connect to an actual person to do.Seriously, how is Purolator still in business with these BS business practices and zero customer service?  Even though I am still waiting for my package, god knows when it will finally be delivered, I have the following tips for delivery.Always, and I mean always get whatever you are having delivered sent to your work address where anyone can sign for it.  Otherwise, you will get the run around and be waiting weeks for a package that you paid for next day delivery.  Also, if you live in an apartment or outside of the downtown core, do not, under any circumstances use Purolator."
"I placed an order from Bestbuy and it was supposed to be shipped by Purolator. As soon as I got the shipping information, I noticed that my unit number was missing, although it was on my online account. I called Bestbuy to inform them and they asked me to call Purolator when I got the tracking number. I got the tracking number the day after  they came to my house. I called Purolator and explained the situation. They rescheduled my order for 3 times, everytime they didn't show up. They are incompetent and unreliable. If there was an option to give less than 1 star I would."
"Nothing against this location, I had good service here by the staff.But for some reason Purolator delivery struggled finding my address 3 times and then I had to go pick up instead at their warehouse... I thought Canada Post owned this company... And they can't find an address? C'mon, are you serious? I moved in to a new construction and Purolator, a large courier company cannot find the address lol... Let me say this, All other delivery companies I ordered stuff from found my address."
"Every shipment I've had from Purolator has missed me, making me travel to pick up my package. Even when I called and notified them that my hours are open from 10am-8pm, they failed to deliver the package.This is a delivery service. I should NEVER have been asked to come and pick up my parcel at your warehouse. This is terrible service and I'll request alternate delivery methods until ratings from others have improved it."
"Ordered 2 car seats from Toys R' Us. The truck came to my door. They rang the bell, but did not knock. My car was parked in front of the house. By the time I got to the door they were driving away. When I called for another delivery, I was told that I would have to pay another shipping fee for the next delivery. When I go to someone's door and ring the bell I don't leave without knocking. And I had paid for shipping to my door. I was at home when they came. Terrible ""service""."
Very unimpressed. Had on of my employees go to the location to pick up a package. The tracking number we had was missing one number. The lady there gave was completely inflexible in trying to find our package and was completely uncooperative and rude. Can a company be so inefficient that they can only find package based on tracking number! USELESS!
One attempt made to deliver the package. No notice left. Called and waited on hold for over an hour to find out what is going on and now have to drive half an hour each way to pick up the package.Horrible service. Absolutely terrible.
"If an ""attempted delivery"" was made at 5:31pm...but the ""we missed you"" notice timestamp was 6:00pm and I was home the whole time and did not once hear the doorbell... What else am I to assume that an attempt wasn't actually made and the only attempt was a poor one at covering your laziness?This follows another delivery made by Purolator where my item was left on my front door (for who knows how long) available to people passing by.So in the span of one week, I had to go out of my way to retrieve one item and my other delivery was shown absolutely no care.  Both times I paid for delivery - and did not get the service I expected.Purolator needs to consider what kind of business they are running - or review their standards for those they hire."
"The customer service rep at this location was decent. Purolator gets ZERO star! If you decide to ship things using Purolator, be ready to get frustrated! The wait time to speak to a rep over the phone was about 20 mins on a Tuesday morning. In the end, the rep was not helpful at all. I decided to drive 35 mins (one way) out of my way to pick up my parcel just so that I don't have to deal with them anymore."
"First the mouth breather that was supposed to deliver my package didn't even knock (I know because I was home waiting for it) then when I went to pick it up the next business day which was a Saturday over an hour before it was supposed to close turns out they felt like closing early. Traveled all that way for nothing, terrible shipping company will do my best not to shop with companies that use purolator from now on"
"What a joke of a company. First of all my apartment has no buzzer. They just come in the lobby and leave a little note. We are supposed to get it delivered to our door. Canada post delivers all my packages to my door and knocks loudly. Second of all, they only have like 1 place to pick up the package 90 Silverstar blvd.. which is pretty far from me, and I don't drive. I Hate this company with a passion. Every time I get a package with them its a big hassle for me. I do not recommend anyone to use this company and to stay far away from it. I recommend FedEx, UPS or Canada Post. Canada Post is 10x better than this pile of heap. Purolator should just go out of business and save us all some trouble dear god."
Very frustrating! I'm sitting at the front of my front window from where I get a clear view of my front door. Working on my laptop. I get to hear every sound so even if the door moves I know. GUESS WHAT? I'M WAITING TO RECIEVE MY SHIPMENT AND IN TURN PURALATOR DECIDES TO GIVE ME A FAKE DELIVERY ATTEMPT! LIKE I WOULDN'T KNOW. GET BETTER DRIVERS YOU GUYS! AND DON'T TURN A BLIND EYE ON OTHER REVIEWS WHEN THEY SAY THAT YOUR NEED BETTER DRIVERS AND YOUR DRIVERS DO FAKE DELIVERY ATTEMPTS AND REPORTINGS! IMPROVISE AND GET NEW DRIVERS!!!
"Pathetic service. The noment i learnt that my Zara order was being delivered by Purolator, i knew i will have to go and pick it myself as they will show attempted delivery without actually making any effort to deliver, this is what they do to save themselves from working. I was not wrong despite being at home waiting and tracking online continuously, all of a sudden tracking started showing attempted to delivery. I did not get any call no one knocked on the door, no notice left on the door either, perhaps like the last time Purolator threw the notice at the ground floor of my building and went away without making any effort to deliver it to my door. I would certainly avoid these lazy guys if i could in this case i had bo choice as they were choosen by Zara."
"Would have given 0 star if possible. Horrible communication and tracking of shipping. Asked yesterday for it to be ready for pick up in North York, confirmed over live chat this morning, was just told that nobody recorded this request and it will not be there.Unacceptably horrifying customer service attitude as well."
"I will now actively avoid companies that use Purolator. Out of the 3 packages sent to me this year I have received a total of 0 when there's someone at home WAITING for the package. The last straw was when I didn't even get a delivery slip instead of an automated phone call telling me to pick up the package from a neighbouring city. I have to drive more than 10km each way to pick up every package from Purolator, and wait in the cold for 30+ minutes because the line-up was so long it extends out of the office doors. Seriously?"
"Driver failed to leave delivery notice on door. The Amazon order system failed to provide Purolator with unit number. Driver did not attempt to call phone number on package for entry. The warehouse was not computerized and the attendant on the phone had to write my address to find my package. Had to rent a car to pick up the package from the distribution warehouse. Use UPS, Canada Post or Amazon courier next time."
"I've had nothing but problems with Puralator since the company that's send my packages uses their service(or lack there of). I live in a apartment building which does not have a buzzer code. Knowing this I'd rather wait for a bit in the lobby compared to the hour bus ride to the depot. I was in the lobby waiting and I witnessed the Purolator truck go past and pull over, so I go out and speak to the driver(who us still in the driver seat) and I asked him if he has a package for my apartment number. He tells me no there's no package and perhaps it's on the other truck. He drives off and in a few minutes I checked the Purolator app to find that driver did have my package and he punched into the system that the address is wrong because there's no buzzer code. This man did not even get out of the truck and on top of that he lied straight to my face. Over the next few hours my annoyance continued to rise as the ""customer service reps"" had no solution to my problem, from one manager telling me it's my word against the drivers, the depot was then contacted and told to contact me with a ETA for the package. All three managers i spoke to told me the best option is for me to wait out in the cold for the driver to return. No call from anyone and the driver did not return with my package. I waited all day until I decided to contact Purolator for the 6th time at 7pm to find my package is at the depot. I've had nothing but problems with Puralators drivers. In my many hours wasted waiting for packages from Purolator I've seen many other shipping companies come to the door and wait to see if anyone will open the building door so they can make their delivery's and do their jobs. At the end of the day this is how Purolator treats their customers they won't be around for much longer."
"Horrible service. I have been waiting for my package by the door all day long. I have been refreshing the tracking page continuously every 30 mins and even talked to the online Chat they ensured me that I would receive my package before 6pm.5 mins ago I got the following update in tracking status:""	Local Time	City	DescriptionJun 6, 2018	5:26 p.m.	Toronto (east/est), ON	Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible""This is false since they did not even leave a delivery note, and no one knocked on my unit. I can't believe this company is still in business. Retailers need to STOP USING PUROLATOR TO DELIVER THEIR PACKAGES IMMEDIATELY.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SERVICE. NOW I HAVE TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO CONTACT SOMEONE FROM PUROLATOR TO PICK UP THE PACKAGE MYSELF!I tried to talk to a manager and escalate the issue online in chat and the woman didn't try to help me at all and just cancelled the chat. Absolute horrible service. And you are all supposed to be in Customer Service Business? I am shocked that I was treated like this. (See screenshot below)"
"No greetings when I entered.  I must have inconvenient the 2 staff's on going gossip.  No  eye contact and just gave me an machine while I continued to listen their gossip, and that i am supposed to sign for receiving the goods, while I feel completely ignored.  I am certain the behaviour is unacceptable to any standard, but perhaps when it comes to Purolator, there is no such thing as customer service."
"I have a 24hr concierge at my condo, the driver must had to sneak past my concierge twice, follow people in to by-pass security in order to leave me a pick-up slip at my  unit door. They make me pick it up at the location 20min away rather than the one 5 min away. Total fail. When I pick it up, then the lady tells me I could have called to tell them to try again and leave it at concierge next time. Is that not what they're suppose to do in the first place? Never heard of a delivery guy trying to sneak past security."
This looks like a shipment centre so the area is quite sketchy. I would not recommend coming here when it is dark outside. The service is very slow and they ship unusually large items to this location. This makes the process even longer when they try to help customers because every item is huge and hard to carry outside the narrow door. Do not recommend for future shipments.
"Had my pacage sitting for 2 days. Said they need 2 people to move it, they never arranged anything with me never got one phone call after 2 escalations. Ended up having to hire my own pick up and delivery person. Called best buy who has an agreement with these fools. Said all they can do is escalate to head office. I would never use aby service that uses this purolator office again. That's why they only have 1.5 stars"
Arrived right at opening on Saturday 9 am and picked up package in less than 5 minutes. Friendly staff. Only negative comment is that the delivery notice said to pick up at York Mills location but when I checked online it said available for pick up here. Make sure to call ahead to confirm that your package is available for pickup at the right location.
"Purolator is synonymous with shipping in Canada, yet the Scarborough side of things need better support.The location feels isolated but there are ample signboards to get you there.If you are coming to pick up a package, call before you come to ensure that you don't waste a lot of time."
"Horrible service. The delivery man called me to say there is a delivery i told him i will be downstairs in a second. When i came out he was already gone. Didn't  even left a notice nor my package. However , when i checked tracking status it said that ""receiver was unavailable"". Lazy asses!! and liars! Dont do anything and get paid for that"
"My Gf ordered a product for me on amazon at the same time as another product for herself which arrived on time as many have before through various couriers which may include purilator. but in this particular instance my product being shipped by purolator somehow had issues with the address which is automatically set by an amazon account, upon resolving this issue on Friday with purolator we were told it could be be next Thursday before receiving the package due to Thanksgiving holiday on Monday, yet Google claims they are open Saturday and Sunday, assuming that is the case, i don't think i or anyone should be required to wait almost an extra week with no compensation for a delivery that was guaranteed on a certain date due to a mistake that was clearly not made during the order."
"If only I could give negative ratings.They attempted to deliver through my garage instead of my front door (opposite ends of the house). Honestly shocked to see how unproffessional this company was. Absolutely no bell was rung, just a notice slapped onto my garage door. Every other company (ups, FedEx) actually delivered to my front door and rung the bell.Thanks to their unproffessional nature, I have to drive out to Scarborough to get my package.Honestly don't even risk using this company. I'm surprised that clothing companies would use this."
"I was so impressed with the staff when I had to pick up an envelope from the customer service as we were out at the time of the original deliveryThe lady behind the counter stopped the customer before me as he didn’t have the proper ID matching the delivery address and his wife’s correct nameShe said we have policies in place to protect the customer and Purolator, so if you don’t have correct ID a package can not be releasedNice to see loyalty and dedication by employeesPaul SandsUnionville"
"Worst delivery service. I've had them say they had attempted to deliver my products on several occasions, but there is always someone home and there has never ever been a knock on my door or even a call to my cell. Canada posts all the way!!!!! Even tho I paid for delivery I alway have to take time out of my day to drive 30 mins away to pick up my products. DON'T USE PURALATOR!!!!!!!!!"
"i just returned to home .i feel mad and disappointed for purolator courier which located at 90 silver star blvd scarborough ON M1V 4V8, i was move to hamilton which is my new house, and i got a notice from my old address shows i had a package on hold cause no one in the house. then i was driving for two hours to be arrived the location to pick up the shipment , but it was bad weather today , so we got traffic problem anywhere. then i got late for 15 mins, then i saw three women in the office , one chinese women was counting money , a blond hair women was laughing and talking to a women who in black hair with white skin. and it was raining and my 6months old baby was in the car and the door was lock , they saw me but they just cross the hand to me which means they are closed. and i said :"" please help cause i was driving for 2 hours from hamilton to here."" they smile to each other but no one is open the door for me, and i said: ""plz, if i can get it today so i dont have to stay in scarborough for overnight"" but still, no one is open the door , i kept knocking on the door, they was start to ignore me , my baby was crying , i was knocking on the door in the rain. they still laughing and talking to each other.... then a deliver saw me stay in the rain with helpless , he was trying to help me , his name is jerry. he took away my notice and he told me he will try to get my shipment to me , and told me to drive the car to the side door then wait for him , 5 mins later a chinese women who was counting money was coming out , then knocking on my door and blame to me with a rude attitude , then i said : ""ok , could you bring me back my notice? "", she said : ""dont belived jerry , he cant help you, and he wont give any notice to you "" , til here , i dont think the women was understand what i mean to the notice , i tried to explain to her, but she was on mad and totally shut me up. i sit in the car with helpless and my baby was crying, and she was return to her office. my mind told me i should report them . not report for i cant get my shipment tonight , not report for they let me stay in the rain. But it for the attitude the women treat me.. so i turned back to the office's door and knock on the door and said:"" i need your name and your ID number, three of you."" they still ignore me and block me outside of the office. i told them"" i am not gonna get my shipment now , i just need your name , three of you. "" but still, there was over 3 people pass the office and saw me stay in the rain , but no one would like to help . such a cold blood company!!!"
"The too bad service I have ever seen. I had a very bad experience by two times. I ordered some toys for my kids from toys r us. the sent me one item by canada post and canada post guys delivered it to my home at right time, but purolator guy called me that thay will deliverd me on Friday (2016/01/20).I waited all day long in my home but the guy didn't call me even didn't buzzing. Today I saw a notice on the main door of my appartment that have to pick up from their office.  so I called their office about that,  the agent behaviour wasn't good as well."
"I think i'm going to write a book of how many orders will it take that Purolator will actually deliver to my place.Do you guys even try to deliver or you pre-write up the ""we missed you"" notice before you leave the facility.Do I need like a glowing neon sign that says please come in, someones home with an auto sensor the fires off a flare?1 star for pretending to deliver.5 stars for the kind and helpful staff that work here that I pick up my orders from.Place is small with only 2 counters, so be patient. Usually a lineup that goes outside. Wonder if those lining up have the same ill fate as my packages."
"Wow... so after reading the reviews, I realize that this is a systemic problem.    I was home ALL day waiting for the package (super important package too btw).  Apparently, they ""attempted"" to deliver... but there was no notice taped to my door.  So I called purolator.  They said they were unable to get to my house.  Ummmm.... I live in a house (not an apartment), on the quietest street in Toronto (not really, but it's super quiet), where you can ALWAYS get a parking spot.  There is nothing, NOTHING that could obstruct them from delivering my package.  No excuse!  Just laziness I guess, maybe wanted off early for the day?  Now I have to drive at least 1/2 hour to pick up myself.  Total joke."
I left a note on both doors to our building saying to leave it over our gate to our backyard..  I seen them driving out the parking lot.. they didnt leave a notice .. called purolator driver said customer not accessible. Um maybe read the note for where to leave it.. now I have to go pick it up or.. wait for next week to be delivered.. idoit!!
"Another story of how purolator service is utter crap comparing to competition.  IMHO, Save your money and time, use a reputable courier company not this amateur hour run  show.Had a packaged scheduled to be delivered on a Tuesday but called ahead the day before and informed purplator that I won't be home. I was told the purolator can't change the date of first delivery( even if you call well ahead the time ) but sure no problem call on Tuesday to schedule a delivery for Wednesday.So called the Purolator on Tuesday evening about rescheduling but ,surprise surprise, they told me sorry we can't schedule it for Wednesday because you called too late( it was around 7 pm). At this point I'm baffled because when I asked over the phone why I wasn't told that there is cut off time, the response I got was "" because we don't want to confuse our customers here at Purolator so we don't give out all the information""   (hint hint: indirectly insulating the customer intelligence)So  at this point I just wanted my damn package to be delivered and this nightmare to be over with. So I scheduled the delivery for Friday of the same week because I couldn't receive the package on Thursday.One would believe/expect after all this everything should go smoothly ( I mean what else can go wrong!!! ), On Friday morning I get a recorded phone call from Purolator that my package is at depot and ready for pick up by customer. What da heck happened??!?Now I'm seriously pissed off because when I checked on-line ( hint hint, the driver never leaves a  note or anything like that so the only way of knowing where your package is checking it on-line )  I see the Purolator tried to deliver it on Thursday.So I called them and now even the Purlator itself was confuse as well, since they were like according to our system it is scheduled for delivery today but we can see the local depot made an attempt yesterday and is not going to be shipped today. We are ""sorry"" do you want it to be delivered next week instead?  After talking to 3 different managers , the last one finally promised to do something since the first 2 managers had gone silent. After a lot of back and fourth , I got them to deliver the package on the day it was supposed to come at the first place."
"I’ve have first hand experience the past 2 months with having contacted (for my employer) over two hundred people that did not receive a Purolator delivery to their residential address, mostly in apartment buildings, condo towers or townhouse developments.Many of the one star ratings was reflective of what I heard first hand from 90+ percent of my callers.  Not glowing at best however I will not let it influence this review.I also had a Purolator delivery this past Saturday to my own door at 3:40pm.  In all fairness, I was out of town and was not expecting this package.  The driver did however leave a notice on the door giving details to pick up my shipment at this Purolator depot today, hence my visit here.With the notice in hand and government issued personal identification, counter staff provided courteous and quick service.If I had been home during the Purolator driver attempt to deliver my package, my rating would still be 4 stars because he/she successfully came up to my floor & door."
We are home waiting for the delivery of my camera at home today and somebody buzz our number I answer the phone but no body answer so I punch to open the door 1:58 so we waited for 3mins enough time to go up in elevator from ground to second floor. After three mins I went down to the main entrance and found the note that posted on the wall from PUROLATOR saying that we did not answer the buzzer. I look outside to look for the truck but to no avail no sign of truck. I called them to call the truck driver to tell him to get back but the operator said that they cannot call the driver. My the very worst delivery so far in the whole Canada.
"Ordered it to my Girlfriends house as I am not living with my parents any more, and They just left a slip on the inner door, Which means they entered the house, when I was in the kitchen cooking at 11am to 1pm. Both doorbells work and yet none were pressed, all that was done was a simple little note was left on the inner door saying they were at my home. Purolator has done this too many times to me where I've had to go pick up my package when I've taken time off work to wait for it.Unfortunately many of the companies I buy products from ship with Purolator when shipping within Canada and it is frustrating. I would give a zero stars but it isn't an option."
"They said, no one was at home to receive the delivery. Our house was full, my brother in law saw the purolator guy and didn't know I was waiting for a delivery.No notice was left. No one even knocked or rung the bell to our house."
worst service i have ever had in my entire life the phone support is a joke and would not give me a timeline even though i was guaranteed that i would get my shipment that day by a previous employee . they could not contact the the place where i was supposed to pick it up.i am going to advise every company shipping things in canada to not use this serviceterrible terrible terrible
"A slip was left on my door indicating to come to this Purolator location for pickup. My name, address, or tracking number wasn't left on the slip so of course they couldn't find the package at this pickup.We waited there for 20 minutes while all the staff hid in the back, not assisting or giving us any updates. I eventually left my address and number, they said they would get back to me, yet they haven't given me any updates since. Horrible organization and staff."
"I guess I'm not the only one. Every shipment from Purolator is not a delivery service. It's more like a pickup service. I have to drive all the way to their warehouse everytime. Even when my mother was at home, I saw a note outside the door saying ""Attempted delivery. No answer"" What? Completely hate Purolator but no idea why other companies are still using them and not UPS or Canada Post. Maybe if we all boycott companies that use Purolator, it might force them to change their shipping agent. Just maybe..."
"Please Avoid this company at any cause, its complete peace of crap. i bought something on NCIX, i was totally at home and for some reason they want me to come to this place out of no where to pick up. i used to complain about canadapost, now i think canada post is complete bless, so nice to pick stuff up at local shoppers drug mart instead of this sheitty place"
"0/10I live in a Bungalow. The driver didn't even ring the bell or knock on the door. Just left the notice straight out from his truck.I heard if they don't see a car in the driveway, they write the notice event before get down from the truck!! Freaking!!And look at their pick up location!! All the way to north to a desert in Toronto."
"Three times they have delivered parcels.  Each time they have not even rung the doorbell to deliver.  Just filled out the slip and slapped it on the door, and we have to go pick it up.  I am writing the companies who use them as their primary delivery company to tell them that, due to such poor delivery service, I am not able to order from them on-line in future."
"I am a medical marijuana user and unfortunately both my licensed producers use Purolator which means I have never actually gotten a delivery because drivers don't wanna go up an elevator because that is too much work. The last order I made, there was an option to tell Purolator not to deliver the package and just keep it at the depot. I woke up in the morning to find out it has been loaded onto a truck. Like what the hell! So instead of being able to go pick up my package on Friday like I had intended to, I have to wait till Monday because their Saturday hours are garbage. Either stay open all day or don't open at all. I have contacted both my LPs and I hope they drop whatever contract they have with Purolator because I, as the person who needs to travel an hour and a half just to walk 20 minutes both ways to the depot, am done with Purolator, and if my LP continues to use this company, I will go elsewhere and run the risk of being charged because this is absolutely disgusting. Like why can't the drivers just call me, ""hey I'm down in the lobby are you home?"" And I can say ""yes I am, let me come downstairs and get the package"""
"They are OK with their service, but to be honest, they do what they can.As consumers, we expect perfection, but forget that it is not always possible to be pefect and things beyond our control can impact the outcome.Something similar happened in my case, i want to blame purulator, but no, i realize they did their best to their ability and always try to enhance themselves. Thanks Purulator."
I went out for 30 minutes and that is when Purolator decided to deliver my package. I got a notice for pick up and they gave me this location though I am closest to York Mills location. I bought something online to save the trip and this is what I get. I should have bought my stuff in the store instead as it is VERY inconvenient for me to travel all the way to Scarborough. Very disappointed.
"Amazon Could Soon Be The World's Biggest Shipping Company, and after dealing with Poor or later on several occasions I can see why.Get a pencil, some paper, call Jeff and take notes."
"AWFUL.Six days, no delivery, two calls to customer service. They will not deliver to my recipient's address, despite having delivered there before.Live chat staff useless and very very rude."
"I missed yesterday without received any call Purolator . then I follow the instruction to pick my package. But when I reach the branch for pick up, the reception people told me that delivery guy gave me the wrong branch address, wrong pick up number and no pick up available date.......wtf !  Then after I picked from another branch today, I received a mistake call from Purolator seems they confused my phone number with others....DON'T CHOOSE PUROLATOR,U'LL BE REGRET!"
Purolator deliver has never been helpful at all. Delivery man consistently leave notice without actual delivery.This location has absolutely snail speed
"I got the email at 9 am telling me , it's  on the truck for today's delivery,I waited all day it seems I was the last delivery of the day, at 4.30  when I was in the washroom,I missed him by 7 minutes.If it tells me it was in transit at 9 am,I shouldn't  have  to  wait until  4.30 and miss him,they told me to pick it up. I was here  the rest of the day and night.they deliver until 8 pm"
So the driver put a notice on my door that the package is available to pick up at 5pm so I went 5pm still not available then I came back 7pm still not available I went the next day still not available what a inconvenient  I went 3 times Friday and Saturday and Sunday is closed and Monday is holiday so wasted 4 days to get the package gonna be on Tuesday
"I have repeatedly had Purolator truck come to my door with a note saying they missed me - no ring or knock, no package in hand. in other words, no intention of trying to give me my package, and I had to go fetch it at this location. I'm not sure if it's fair to give this location only one star, because I don't know where the driver is from... my direct experience with this location has been good, but they couldn't do anything about the drivers in question when I complained."
"Since Christmas this store/dropoff location no longer gives receipts when you drop off your packages. So, if your parcel is not scanned it will be untrackable thus the customer will have no proof that they dropped off their parcel. The excuse I was given as to why there is NO MORE RECEIPTS, 'the paper is too expensive'.  Really Purolator, I'm sure you can afford it with what you charge or maybe you should ask Canada Post for a paper loan!!!!!!!!!!!!Vanessa, you obviously did not read the post correctly. I am talking about PROOF OF DROP OFF. Having the shipping label is no good if it is NOT scanned. So here is the scenario: I drop off 2 packages, I leave the store, later on I look in the system for the tracking updates and only see one. Can't find the other. I go back to the store the next day and show the clerk my two tracking numbers but he/she can only find one in the system, but I dropped off two packages, they say 'Sorry Ma'am but we only have the one, are you sure you brought in two packages?'. There has to be a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT for the Customer before they leave the store. Clerks get busy,  parcels can be put in the wrong place or they think they scanned them but they have not been scanned and are passed through. The parcel should be scanned in front of the Customer and a PROOF OF DROP OFF RECEIPT provided before the Customer leaves the store. Mistakes happen and I know they do, WHY, I have had 25 years in the Postal business, I worked in many departments including the plants, so I know what I'm talking about. I will no longer use Purolator for this reason, I agree you need to cut costs, but cutting a Customer's PROOF and CONFIDENCE is not one of them and definitely not good business practice when the Customer and their merchandise is supposed to be your #1 number one priority."
"Does anyone know how this company is still in business today? I read the reviews and I'm just surprised because I also met very bad service. I do not know how they delivered my package, but for several weeks the delivery person did not call me even once. If you live in an apartment building, avoid this company. They are incapable of calling people to deliver a package.Separately, I want to say about the customer service. Generally rude and indifferent people work there. They called me three times, and I explained all three times that the delivery man would call me upon arrival. I would go downstairs and pick it up myself. The driver does not even have to climb to the top floor. But it was all useless. These are irresponsible people who do their job very badly. I requested that my package be returned to the sender and we will use another courier company to send my package.No more Purolator."
"First, package was delayed by a day because my building was “inaccessible” although I live in a high rise on a Main Street, next day it was taken out of the delivery vehicle because they had too many deliveries, on top of that I got all these information from a customer service representative in a “ non apologetic deal with it” attitude. Very frustrating experience, two days past the deadline and still no delivery, and this is a 1-2 business days express delivery. Unbelievable."
Ordered an item that was being delivered by purolator. They have me a delivery date. I had someone home all day. Purolator claimed my house was inaccessible. When I contacted them to find out why I got no answer. My house was accessible all day and someone was home. Sounds like the driver was lazy and wanted to end their day early. However I have them a new address. Then they claimed the area was incorrect. It is not incorrect. Tried contacting to find out and all the agents stated was they had no information. I requested to talk to manager to find out what is going on. And all the agents ended the chat. Not impressed. I'm paying for express delivery and they can't even tell me what the problem is.
"Staff was polite and knowledgeable at location.   I could not pick up an envelope for my spouse, they  needed her signature- only hers.  Asked for re delivery.  Tracking shows envelope put on truck and then dropped back at the counter 1 hr later!  No delivery attempt!  Called for another re delivery.  This time the driver tossed the envelope on the porch- under the mail box!- rang bell and left- no signature with an exposed envelope to potentially blow away in the wind!! Envelope clearly states ""Do not leave- signature required"". Horrible driver!"
"Bad experience, i was at waiting to receive a laptop for my work at home on Friday morning, they updated the status as went out for delivery in the morning,  after 6 they updated as no one at home. But no one came. I called the support center and told no one came to deliver, now they updated like this,  then i requested to deliver to the neary purolator center on next day, when i went there no use, again on Monday they updated as went to deliver, in the evening updated as my address is not there. Then i asked how come on Friday they updated as no one at home, now they updated like this then they escalated. Finally on Tuesday i went in person and received the laptop"
"5 minutes agoNEWI haven’t dealt with this location yet BUT i will most likely have to tomorrow. I’ve been awake since 8 am and so have all of my 4 other roommates, apparently they made an attempt to deliver my package but some how none of us heard them even though I was on the main floor beside the door reading while waiting. The note they left on the door contradicts what they said on the website, one says the attempt was made at 9:45 and the other says 9:25… and then when I told them about my situation (what happened and why I need it today because it was already delayed so it’s Been 2 weeks since I was supposed to revive it) they said they’ll let the driver know to come back if there is time but no guarantee and the website won’t update if they are Gonna come back and they can’t let me know. So I just have to sit here and wait for my package even though I don’t think it is going to come considering they couldn’t even make the initial delivery. This is a terrible delivery company and just like the reviews below many people I have spoken to in person say that purolator is known for this. Very upset and stressed about this"
"""ZERO RATING ONLY IF I CAN RATE IN NEGATIVE"".... Pathetic service... If you want your package to be safe never ever use PUROLATOR... they never left a note saying that they attempted delivery and unless I asked on chat there was no update on this. Their customer service is also pathetic no one really gives any proper answers and they are taking more than a week now to actually make my package available for pickup still no update. At this point I think that they don't even attempt any delivery and just say that they did so customer can pickup.. WORST DELIVERY SERVICE EVER!!!!"
"TOTALLY SERIOUSLY BAD SERVICE NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!I totally have the same problem that the delivery guy is too lazy that they did not even reach us even when we were at home the entire day. I did not receive any notice from the building, email or phone. If I did not contact them and check the order status online, they will just leave my 84 lbs bed in their pick up spot and ask me to pick up."
I had a pickup scheduled for yesterday morning and no on one ever showed up. Mind you it is a test that is mandatory I called multiple times. Just to be told the driver marked it as picked up. How are you guys telling me my package is picked up but it’s right in front of my face. I can’t keep putting my package in and out of the fridge. Plus to get into the building you must be buzzed in so how did you pick up my package if I never buzzed you in. And you can’t even file a complaint it tells you to go to the virtual assistant.
I’m writing this as more of a review of the entire company.I was expecting 3 very expensive packages on the day of delivery I noticed the company (not puraltor) had made a mistake of the address of one of my packages. I called and spoke with 2 very helpful team members. They contacted the driver and corrected the mistake and all my packages were dropped off safely. I’m beyond happy and the staff went above and beyond to correct a mistake they did NOT make!
"I dropped off two packages for a return, and only 1/2 got shipped. It’s been 2 days now and I am VERY CONCERNED!!! How did the other package just disappear? And now I’m on the phone trying to get a hold of a customer service agent and I’ve been on hold for over 25 minutes. This is ridiculous and there is no phone number for this exact location either. So I can’t even call the location that lost the package, I have to jump through hoops"
"Zero star.We were 4 person at home, We had three different parcel for three different person. The delivery person didn’t knock the door, didn’t even call the single person to inform he is outside. He just put all the notes on door saying delivery attempted receiver unavailable and left. It seems like Purolator thinks they are working for free. I have seen so many times Purolator always leave notes at the front of my building and that is the reason for less star."
"As I sit in my living room, reading the updates on the tracking page I'm laughing at the blatant stupidity of an excuse as to why my delivery of an infant car seat and stroller were not delivered AGAIN- as being a natural disaster in Ottawa today, May 26, 2022. A drop of rain does not a disaster make, especially since your lazy driver left a note Wednesday saying to pick it up at another location- then called twice today and got two different reasons!!! For the love of god, I wish you people would stop lying and making excuses and start working. I've never encountered such useless couriers with no pride in work performance!"
"your service is horrible and you guys are liars  and fraud worst service ever.. my brand new iPhone which was supposed to be delivered was never received however, apparently the purolator facility located at 1400 clyde ave gave it to someone without checking any proof of identification or customer signature and front desk guy apparently didn’t have any clue what he was doing i called customer support and the agent said well that’s life no sign of empathy or follow agent took my email id and said he gonna send me an email but nothing has been received looks like you guys are scammers"
"This has been an extremely frustrating experience trying to receive my package. My package was supposed to arrive last week but I received notification that there was a problem with the address. I checked with Purolator who confirmed that the address was correct and I was informed that I would need to have the packaged redirected to Penguin pick up, as the workers knew it would be a hassle to get it delivered. Despite having the package redirected, 2 more delivery attempts were made at my apartment. I have been home this entire time and I can confirm no attempts have been made. I called Purolator again to ensure I could pick up the package. Now my package has been in the city for over a week and I still do not have it due to their complete incompetence. I could have walked over to Purolator myself to get the package in far less time than it has taken for their delivery. I still have not received my package which is over a week late. Worst delivery service I have ever used."
I would give 0 star if I could. This delivery company simply can’t deliver any item. I ordered an item on Amazon and the item was hold on their hand for 6 days. This company said that I gave them the “ incorrect address” and can not deliver. The fun fact was that my friend who lives in the same apartment received her pickup notice. and I told them I would pick the item up myself then one day later the item was shipped to seller without my permission.
"They don't even try to deliver. I'm always home and the day I got the notice I had received no knock, no doorbell ring, no call, nothing...I literally was waiting to get my package that day and yet they dropped off a notice in silence.And when you go to pick up the line up is massive and you're looking at waiting in line for at least 1 hour before getting your package. The service has gone from hero to zero for this company."
"Worst courier for Amazon, these guys are pathetic, shouldn't even be in the business, if item is too heavy , lazy delivery person won't even attempt to deliver, they should pay for my Amazon Prime membership because of the gross inconvenience.FEDEX lady delivered 2 of the boxes these clowns REFUSED to deliver, maybe they should get her to show their employees how to USE A BUZZER and lift HEAVY packages."
"Where to begin? The package was not delivered after waiting 2 weeks for it. They charged 3 times for the same shipment. The first attempt was made when no one was home, but no information was left. The second attempt said that the address was incomplete (which begs the question how did the first attempt figure out we weren't home?) Attempts to resolve by phone didn't result in the package being delivered. No slip with information about where to find it was ever given. The ONLY phone number available was the 1-888- number which I sat on hold for hours at a time. I can't say enough about how BAD this service is."
"Worst delivery service I ever dealt with!Edit:You say you focus on providing ""better"" customer service..The first time the guy did not even knock he just left a sticker. I then go to the location to pick up the package (25 min drive by the way) after needing to borrow a car from my father in law just to find that it was not there at the time it was suppose to be. I asked for it to be re-delivered. They then delivered it to a store rather than my house. I then had to re-borrow the car again to get the package.Wow amazing customer service you guys have. Truly you focus on customer service and customer satisfaction. A+ (sarcasm by the way in case you were unsure..)"
"Very bad service.No buzzer ring, no NOTICE SLIPS(because the delivery guy is out of slips- not once but multiple times) and delayed updates.The whole point of getting it shipped to home is to avoid visiting a store and these people are making us visit their store multiple times due to delayed update of delivery preferences."
"Paid for ~1 day shipping for an emergency/rush order for a customer up North. Package bounced from Ottawa to Montreal to Toronto (2 days) then finally up north. After picking up the package (they wouldn't deliver to his house) he found that not only was the outside damaged, but the goods were completely destroyed. Purolator somehow managed to hit the package so hard that 2 inches of padding + bubble wrap wasn't enough to protect the product. I've yet to hear from them about a refund. Great service guys."
What is this neglect?There is nothing worse than this company. Is it reasonable for the postman to leave me a receipt to receive my parcel and not call me knowing that I am waiting for it empty-handed and when I went to the center the next day I did not receive it because the postman left him with him in his car.
"I’m not sure who’s in charge of delivering packages in my Nepean area with Purolator, but they NEVER attempt to deliver my package and always say that an attempt was made. I am always home at the time of the “attempt”, my shipments are never large, never require a signature and can easily be left at the door or brought up to my apartment. They have all of my info (name, address, buzzer, apartment number, phone number) and not once have I ever had a shipment delivered successfully by Purolator. As someone who doesn’t drive, it is extremely frustrating to have to constantly pick up my packages that I’ve had shipped to my house for a reason, ESPECIALLY when I’ve paid for expedited shipping. Given the other reviews, this experience is obviously not unique and something needs to be done. When I see my packages are being shipped by Purolator, I automatically know that it won’t get delivered. There is absolutely no excuse."
Bad customer service. They just called me with a single option to get my package cause they won't be able to delivery as I don't have a buzz number in my apartment. The woman in the phone was close to disrespectful with me. Now I'll have to pickup a package 6 days after buying with Amazon prime and 2 days delivery service! Good way to impress the customer Amazon and Purolator!
"Ordered something from Michaels Canada and was told it would be delivered between October 5-9. Well, October 9 comes around and I don’t have my package. I track my package and what do I find out? My package said that a “delivery was attempted” at 2pm on October 6 which DIDNT HAPPEN because my roommates and I were all home and no one came by. Then it said it’s been at the purolator pick up since October 6, and I have 5 business days to get my package. No email, no notification it was ready to be picked up, no delivery attempt. I’m getting really sick of lazy delivery workers right now especially when I don’t want to be going out in public. Just disappointing and unprofessional."
"The WORST customer service I’ve experienced in a long time from the girls working the front desk. I will make sure I never order anything that will be delivered through purolator again. I can’t believe how rude they were, over the phone when I was simply looking to track my package; and in person when I went to pick it up. You need to look for better staff ASAP, or you will just keep losing customers! HORRIBLE dealing with them! It’s now 3 days later and my blood is still boiling from the experience!"
"I was waiting for my package during weekend. I got a call and answered, without answering my reply the delivery man cancel the call, I got an email in a few minutes says Delivery attempted, sorry we missed you! not even put a note that where is my package! Why even this service is running!  How to avoid the packages go through this courier when we shop from Amazon? every time I have to go down to one of their offices!"
"Worst carrier ever!I didn't receive my order yet Purolator changed the status to ""Delivered"".They claimed to have attempted to deliver on July 15th but nobody came (my wife and I were at home the entire day). Due to their claim, I rescheduled for July 17th. The tracking info was totally erratic.I was notified that I should be picking up my shipment and when I was there, a woman told me that my shipment was separated for delivery between 17th and July 18th.I didn't receive and they changed the status to ""delivered"" and I can't even track the number anymore!"
"3 dubble thumbs down!! Absolute terrible delivery service. So many times have I had a notice on my door when I was at home waiting for it, or a quick one ring on the doorbell and leave a notice, or nothing and then send an email saying it’s delivered at the depot due to unsuccessful delivery attempt. The old “go-get-it-yourself” method.The website does not update, at all, so you can’t actually properly track your package. Calling customer service, doesn’t do much good either. Just got off the phone with customer service, nice lady, not her fault, but she couldn’t see or do anything for me. Been waiting for a package since Monday (Wednesday 7pm now), she couldn’t see where the driver is, if he’s done for the day, if the package is still coming, or what. Complete mystery. She tried calling the depot and the driver, no answer off course. I don’t yell at the customer service lady, cause there’s nothing she can do about it, it’s just PUROLATOR that PURE SUCKS!!!!I know they can all be bad, but PUROLATOR sucks the most off all of them. Wow you guys are over the top inefficient. Next time, I’m driving 10hrs to pick up the item ordered."
"Was supposed to get my package on Monday, delivery dude came left without any notice. Second day Same thing, third day I scheduled a pickup and bussed 3hrs round trip and when I got there they lady there said they didn't have my package There!!!😠. Now I'm back to waiting for the delivery!!!Pls don't waste your time and find someone else."
"Worst customer service, my package was supposed to arrive on tuesday and i didn't get it, then today there was an attempted delivery which i missed because there's no buzzer in the building, along with no slip being left, I called and was told they don't leave them in apartment building's anymore, it would have been nice to been made aware of that before i tried for delivery with this service, now i have no idea I will know when the package is to be delivered again! Last time i use this service"
A delivery attempt was supposedly made but no delivery card was left at my house. In the end I had to pick it up at this location. Happens every time. Wish I could request Canada Post.Update: I was awaiting another package. No delivery card left at my house. I got a call a couple days later that the package was waiting for me at Purolator. No doubt there was no delivery attempt. Such bad delivery service.
"Very poor service! They never really deliver your item, only give you a notice that asks you to pick it up by yourself! Always delay delivery! Don’t use the company anymoreUpdate on Sep 2019————-I brought a item from Amazon, it showed would be delivered by Amazon, but actually was delivered by the Purolator, my item has been delayed more than one week and it shows the item has delivered one week age, Amazon said the Purolator said it’s scan error, but I haven’t seen my item until today! Trust me! Don’t use the company anymore!"
"OMGG I read the reviews and I was like, I've been to a puraltor before (not this one) how bad can it be? first of all... if your delivery slip says to pick up the next day at a certain time, don't do it. it won't be there. second, I told them to redeliver considering its a table which I cant pick up and take with me on the bus. did they? NO. they dropped it off at ANOTHER location and I had to call them to confirm it was actually there!!! why does Best Buy use these people??? according to puralator they use a third party to delivery packages and they have no control over whether they ring your doorbell or not. why would a delivery company not have any delivery people themselves/????"
"I’d give a zero.I’m always home, no bell ring, no phone ring, no knock on door. Just left an unreadable note. Questions are:1. Where is my package now?!2. Are you coming back tomorrow again or not?!3. If not, where and when do I pick up by myself?!4. I really don’t want to call you guys because it never go through!!I mean, seriously guys? You cannot do this to your customers.. I’d rather drive all the way from Ottawa to Toronto, pick up my new phone, than wait for your fake service.. ridiculous..."
If I could give a 0 star I would. Had to have a package sent to my parents because I couldn’t be delivered to my P.O. Box. Wouldn’t let me have my package even though my name matched up and explained my situation.I have to now to have a parent escort me into the store to be able to receive my package. Like come on.
"One star just because can't offer less. I was treated in a very despicable way, abusive attitude, as if I went to beg at their door.I had a miss delivery at 8pm and a note sending me to get my item from the Hawthorne office.I arrived at the   above mentioned location, timely manner, to find out that...I have to get it from Clyde Ave. location.Well, there you go! I have got my lesson from the worker from behind the counter just because I dared  to say that I would appreciate next time to be notified with the right address.NEVER again Purolator, I will avoid any company which deal with these guys.When on Hawthorne, I received a document  specifying location, order nr., etc. The worker from Clyde location, refused to return it to me, refused telling her name, having a DESPICABLE (can not stress enough!) behaviour.  What an unpleasant experience!"
"I waited all day long then finally had to go out at 4:30 pm.  A few minutes ago I went online to see if the package was ever delivered.  The online track showed they attempted to deliver it at 3:30.  B****!  I sat close to the phone buzzer all day waiting, so I know the delivery person did NOT bother to buzz me.  So, that means I'll have to take 2 buses halfway across town to pick it up myself within 5 days.  If Canada Post owns Purolator, why couldn't the driver have put my package in a very safe and convenient Canada Post 'drop box' which is located in the lobby of my apartment building?"
"There was a mis-labbeling on a package.  Called in and got it fixed.  Packaged my stuff for me.Staff usually very helpful.  They don't seem happy, but so far they've been helpful.And the location!!!! So convenient!!!  Here's hoping I never get a package through UPS."
"Usually all package were drop before my door, but this time I got a notice... I have 5 days to pick up and I literally have no time as I have to travel. That's why I order online. There is no way to contact purulator as I was directed to an automate voice and no way to reach a representative. The website always ask me to register as a company to schedule a pick up, but I'm no company to register. Need an answer. I can just cancel my package an purulator would lose their job"
"Very very bad! Three attempts no success, drivers don't call and don't even care. I'm wondering how are they hired. The first attempt was a wrong address so I called to correct it so they tried again the next day but, guess what, it hasn't been corrected on the package. We tried again the second attempt where I maid a request to get called the cell phone number; no succes. Third attempt; I was waiting at the door for 5 hours and guess what, on the website it says "" attention receiver doesn't respond at 11:54"" I was at the door fixing my car from 8:40 to 1 pm. Now I have to go to pick it up 40 km away...disappointing."
"I was expecting a bulky package from Purolator on Tuesday. I took the day off from work and stayed at home for four business days until Friday and every day I got an online update that there is a missed delivery due to high volume of freight. In the meanwhile, I contacted purolator's customer service twice with two case numbers. Some tracing specialist was also keeping track of the item. After two days I got an update that package is ready to pick up at this Purolator center. It is absolutely nonsense especially that I have been available all the time and I did not receive any single notice of miss delivery at my place. In fact, they never attempted delivering my box. I contacted them many times and they kept saying they are sorry for that with no action. This is absolutely unacceptable under any standards. When they don't bother to attemp delivering your item, what is the point in doing online shopping? Instead of picking up the item at Purolator, I could buy the item at store!"
"My buzzer connected with my phone, but there was no one buzzed me for my package, and I didn't even get a notification from Purlator at the front door of my building after four days my package had been arriving and accepted by Sue, the lady worked as the receiptionist in Purlator. It was lucky that I had suddenly remembered that I bought something online yesterday, otherwise they would be returned to the seller tomorrow!To make things worse, I made a complaint to the receiptionist Sue after I drove 10 mins to pick up my package. Instead of saying something politically correct like ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"", she blamed it on me, Lol!  I lived in a apartment and I clearly included my apt number in my delievery address, which was the number to buzz me of course. But Sue insisted that I should have written down something specifically like ""Buzz Code 101"" in the address to ""avoid any confusion"". Oh really? I honestly think a simple ""sorry we were just getting lazy that day"" will literally do better than this.Purolator is terrible."
"If I could chose who ships my item. I would pick Canada Post since there just beside my house. Sadly i cant when i order stuff online. Its a mix bag of service I feel. Im not angry, just have to go around my work schedule to get it by the 5 day limit.....why not 10. It a bit difficult for me to get to any of the location on buss since I have to transfer and the busses are not frequent. i call and ask if hold item on day im off work and they said no. I cant go in the morning since with buss i would be late for work. Then afternoon the place would be closed when im finish work. Just wish the hours or ease of access was better vs canada post hold package for twe weeks."
"Purolators drivers are not professional and dishonest. They don't do their job efficiently. They simply don't deliver some packages and instead they mark it online as "" attempted delivery..receiver unavailable""..They are simply PUROliars.And when you call their customer service you'll find that they're even worse than the drivers. They back up their drivers and try to make you look like you're lying...Shame on you Purolators...I'll never again do business with them."
"Not 1 time but 2 times I was expecting a very important item in the mail, both times I was at HOME because I signed up for delivery confirmation , and 1 time the parcel was sent back , and this time I had to go pick it up... very poor service in my opinion... smarten up!! The drivers are just lazy in my opinion!!!! Don't want to be bothered!!"
I cannot even get back my parcel with my ID and 2 pieces of receipts. They want me to show a document with my name and the address on the package. I'm now living in my friend's house. So they can be rude to me and refuse to give my parcel back while I was there to pick up? Please never use purolator service if your parcel address is not your home address. They won't give it to you anyways.
"They delivered $200 gift cards to the wrong address! Had redeemed $200 worth of gift cards from Scotiabank sent out by these guys. Long story short, I was able to find out that they delivered it to the same unit but on the street before mine. Spent the next few weeks calling back and forth and in the end they refuse to take my word, basically labelled me as a liar, and repeatedly told me to look at the signature on the tracking info saying it did get delivered to my address, which doesn't make sense as i'm the only person living in my house and it was signed by another person. Never trust Purolator. If anything goes wrong they won't take resposnbility for it."
I'm going to give two stars because I've had some *okay* experiences with this particular location but I am getting close to not using Purolator period. It must be a tough job to work because some of the people there are absolutely miserable and needlessly rude to customers. There's a very good reason this place has poor reviews.
"Everytime I see that Purolator is going to be handling my package, I sigh because I know that it's going be an extra week or two of dealing with their bs before I get whatever I ordered. I wish I could choose which company would be delivering my packages so I could avoid Purolator everytime.Purolator is just sooooo baaaad.Intelcom, UPS, and Canada Post are all waaaaay better."
"Horrible service, packages left in front of my apartment without notice, and now they've holding a package and not delivering without leaving a pickup notice or using my buzzer.I'd recommend using anywhere other than here"
"Once again,purolator fails to deliver.if i had a choice i would never use them.I've been waiting for a week for an item and the last update was 4 days ago.what's worse is,we've been waiting at home held captive waiting to see if and when they show up.Home all day today and receive an email saying they attempted to deliver but nobody was home.Nobody attempted anything;nobody knocked, they didn't ring the doorbell,and my 2 dogs would've let us know if anyone was within 20 ft of the door.This seems to happen all the time with them and now it'll probably be another week or so if i'm lucky."
"If could give it 0 stars I would. Worst experience I’ve had trying to ship something. I got there before about 15 people but received very little help before they dealt with anyone else. Had to reenter shipping info 3 times in the computer before it actually worked. All the info was already on a label I made but I had to make their label for some reason. And for whatever reason the employees couldn’t do ship it themselves when everything there. Should have taken 2 minutes but it was 30+ minute ordeal. Lady on the phone said that it should take the package 2 days, but when I got to the centre they said 3. The call was placed within 20 minutes of me getting to the centre. Flight leaves Monday night either way so the system they use is not reliable."
"I’m yet to receive a package from Purolator on time. When I buy something online that is expensive and I find out they used Purolator to ship it I become very anxious and worried because on top of delivering my packages late, the driver doesn’t even bother ringing the bell after they dump the package outside for anyone to steal. Everything became clear and started making sense when I learnt that they are owned by Canada Post. I now call merchants before hand and ask if they have different shipping options, and if they only ship with Purolator then I don’t buy from them 🤷‍♂️"
I was waiting for my parcel since morning and the delivery driver left a note at the apartment's main door that the receiver was not at home. My phone number and buzzer code was on my shipping address. I didn't received any call or buzzer. Just received a email and I immediately went down to check a note was there. I paid 20 dollars for shipment. When I called them they said they can re-deliver it on Monday ( today is Friday) or I can pick it up from their shipping centre which is 7 KM apart. Why I paid 20CAD if I was going to pick it up.
"Does anyone know how this company is still on the market today? I read the reviews and I'm just surprised because I also met very bad service. I do not know how they delivered my package, but for several weeks the delivery person did not call me even once. If you live in an apartment building, avoid this company. They are incapable of calling people to deliver a package.Separately, I want to say about the customer service. Generally rude and indifferent people work there. They called me three times, and I explained all three times that the delivery man would call me upon arrival. I would go downstairs and pick it up myself. The driver does not even have to climb to the top floor. But it was all useless. These are irresponsible people who do their job very badly. I requested that my package be returned to the sender and we will use another courier company to send my package.No more Purolator."
"Your driver has a lack of respect for people's private property in Half Moon Bay. This is not the first time that they use our driveway to turn around rather than go around the street (1 min detour). He drives over our land and this damaged the edge of our driveway. Now that I have a cam, I will keep all future proofs and send you the bill if he keeps doing this."
The staff are efficient & helpful but that's not the problem. The problem is that this location is ridiculously out of the way & difficult to reach for someone who lives in the city & doesn't have a car. Yet Purolator expects you to go there to collect packages in case of missed delivery or to get assistance with shipping products not available at their third-party partners/agents. It takes a 3 busses each way and a couple of hours of commute time just to get back and forth. Why not allow your agents/partners to offer these services on your behalf and make it easier for the customer if you are unable to open a more central location?
"2 ""Purolator deliveries"" from same company to the same location & NEITHER TIME attempted to actually deliver the packages.  Are you not a delivery company???  Why do I have to drive across town to pick up my deliveries?  Both times I was home, no log of buzzer attempted, no phone log of call, no delivery notification.  I would give a ""0"" if possible.  Absolutely pathetic.  I will know not deal w any company that uses Purolator as a delivery company.  BRUTAL..."
I recently had to return a Bell DVR. A horrible experience on their website to arrange a pickup. I gave up.I was heading over that way so I decided to drop by. It was Wednesday afternoon around 2:00 p.m. From start to finish I was in the building less than five minutes! I walked in the door with my box and the chap called me over and started taping it as I handed him the pre-paid label. He took it out of my hands and said he'd look after it. He ensured I had the tracking number and he wished me a good afternoon.I would have given them five stars if the website was even navigable.
"A real joke, it can’t be serious !!! Drivers are coming home w/o knocking/ringing the bell and straight up leaving “the missing ticket on the door” like client are pieces of s***tThe senders are wasting money engaging such unprofessional company like you, and the client who’s me is just watching our package played by unprofessional drivers like yours.This company should NEVER EVER EXISTED in 2023."
"Unreliable service. Or, no service, actually. On a number of occasions, i have received a text telling me my package was ready to be picked up way out at Hawthorne when absolutely no attempt was made to deliver it to me. So, now, if a merchant uses Purolator for shipping, I try to find another merchant to buy from, it’s that simple. Purolator has had problems with their service for some time now."
"Staff were very helpful with parcel pickup from automated locked boxes outdoors in dark, cold and rainy conditions.Low marks to driver who left a ""sorry we missed you"" note when I was home and waiting for delivery and had left a large note on door saying to ring bell and wait as it takes me some time to get to door!! Not good. It was a long drive in miserable weather to pick up parcel after 5pm. 6pm by time I got there. Purolator driver could have waited as instructed. Yes doorbell works!"
It's pretty far away. I wished they had closer locations. Having one worker at the front is really unfair. I felt bad for the lone person working the front because there were a lot of people and people don't order small packages with Purolator. There was a gigantic tv she had to lift by herself and a bunch of others while the line up was getting packed. Not cool
"I went in to retrieve my package and was told that I needed a security code that was texted to me. I explained that my phone was broken (the package is the replacement phone) and therefore I didn't have the code. They advised me to call my phone company and have them send the code to a different cell phone that I did have access to. After messing around for over an hour with my phone company, we realized that this was completely inaccurate information and that Purolator was responsible for issuing the text message, not the individual phone carrier. So I went back to Purolator that evening (Wednesday) and explained the situation. I was told that the only option would be to have the phone re-delivered to my residence. I said that was fine and they assured me it would arrive the next day. I waited around all day the next day (Thursday) and the following (Friday). Friday evening I called Purolator (spent an hour waiting on hold) and asked where the phone was. They said they had only issued the re-delivery on Thursday night and that it should have arrived Friday (a day later than I was told) but ""for some reason"" it wasn't loaded on the truck. Now it's the weekend and I have to wait until Monday."
I live at West end and as always we miss our shipment and are forced to drive 30 minutes east to pick up. Why not pick up at Clyde location? Add more locations??Busy location. Not worth doing business here. - at least they were friendly to me and I didn't wait as long as I thought.
"INCOMPETENCE EXPERIENCED Every step of an expected delivery was botched. Too many mistakes to type in a review. The highlight of this Kafkaesque comic tragedy was when I went to their depot (as they instructed) after a ""failed delivery"" ( we were home they never rang the doorbell) and they couldn't find the package . I asked the service agent at the front desk for his name OR Employee ID number so I could document this moment in the overall whole experience in  a complaint.He refused and told me his employee ID number is his ""personal info"". Right then a food delivery man shows up with his lunch and asks him to confirm his name - which he complied with. At Least somebody got their package delivered.Don't bother sending an auto  response to contact customer service."
Pretty awful service. I put an order in from a company in ottawa and then they sent a Purolator it was 1 envelope! And then they said I wasn't there for drop off so they brought it back to there pick up center ! Which is 1 hour drive from my house. How does that make any sense I could've just went to the store I ordered it from and picked it up. Very disappointed and when I called it was a 3 hour wait for a Purolator person.
Horrendous service. I don’t think their drivers actually get out of their vehicles on “deliveries”. They don’t see a light on so they keep driving. Then they send you and email saying they’ve left your a slip with a pick up location when in fact there was NO SLIP.Try calling their customer service line! Lol 30min before you’re connected to someone who has no idea what’s going on.How are companies still using this organization for deliveries?? How is this company still in business??
"i join with others in my frustration with purolator policy. i get no notice that something is being delivered to me let alone what it is. people can have more than one purchase they've made recently. why don't they email us that a delivery is coming and confirm address? when they fail to deliver when i was home, they call later saying they need more info eg ring number. that's something that they could have taken care of before-they're a shipping company-they should anticipate this. they tell me they'll be by the next day, i am there all morn but no one comes so i go to shop locally at noon thinking its the least likely time purolator will show up-wrong! they did and then i get the robo call-'your item is now half way across the city at one of only two pickup locations'. i have health issues and for my to go out for 3hrs there and back at 7.50 dollars bus fare when i've already paid for shipping is beyond inconvenient. why do companies like this maintain policies that are obviously turning off 'customers'?Nov. 18/22  this time its amazon using purolator-not my choosing! and again, purolator can't deliver after 3'attempts'-they don't know how to use the buzzer the way amazon delivery people have every month. of course, they can call me to tell me to go across the city to pick up from them but naturally they can't call me to tell me the item is in the lobby nor ask someone to open the door for them nor have a customer service line you can actually get through to talk to someone. I was able to get thru with the chat agent eventually to confirm my address and still delivery failed."
"I haven’t dealt with this location yet BUT i will most likely have to tomorrow. I’ve been awake since 8 am and so have all of my 4 other roommates, apparently they made an attempt to deliver my package but some how none of us heard them even though I was on the main floor beside the door reading while waiting. The note they left on the door contradicts what they said on the website, one says the attempt was made at 9:45 and the other says 9:25… and then when I told them about my situation (what happened and why I need it today because it was already delayed so it’s Been 2 weeks since I was supposed to revive it) they said they’ll let the driver know to come back if there is time but no guarantee and the website won’t update if they are Gonna come back and they can’t let me know. So I just have to sit here and wait for my package even though I don’t think it is going to come considering they couldn’t even make the initial delivery. This is a terrible delivery company and just like the reviews below many people I have spoken to in person say that purolator is known for this. Very upset and stressed about this"
They have great customer service!! I will definitely use Purolator more often 🙂Edit: The folks at the shipping center go above and beyond to try to help ... It's rare to see that level of dedication...Kudos!!**I did however have a bad experience with a delivery where the driver didn't even attempt to deliver my package because I didn't have a buzzer in the address... There was a phone number so they could have called or even looked at the buzzer list my name is literally the first name.... anyways I won't change my rating because my experience at the shipping center made-up for it ...kinda 🙃
"Ordered an item and paid extra to have it shipped next day. The item never arrived. The day after I get an email from the seller with my tracking number. I check it and it said they attempted delivery, knocked but wasn't home. They didn't even attempt to leave me a sticker. Issue was I was home at the time and no foot points apart from my own were at my door. So basically the driver was lying. I called Purolator and the best they can do is deliver it again Friday... Or I can go pick it up at their depot... I mean I paid extra for next day shipping and they failed at that. Why should I have to waste my own time and gas to pick it up? Customer service is non exisistent there. No apologies or any attempt to resolve this amicably."
"This is definitely the WORST delivery company in Canada. If they ever close their doors no one will ever miss them. Good luck with receiving your package  its a nightmare.I gave them benefit of the doubt few times but nope,never good service,always need to run around for your package, call 100 times...incredible, never have these issues with other companies.  Will avoid ordering anything delivered by them.Update: still horrible service, they never ring the door call or try to contact customer any way, just stick theire paper at the door and leave, the worst of worst..please Purolator close your buissnes or hire people who will do their job."
"Friendly, helpful and speedy service. You dont have to print your return label before going their. Can be generated for you.The location is about 12 minutes to the bustop so might not be easily accessible for some. Especially during winter. The pick up option might be a better alternative"
"Called in to customer support after the driver left w/out knocking. Waited for 20 minutes to be told by the customer service person that people say this all the time and usually they missed hearing it.I was told it would be redelivered the next day. I was not confident this would be done as the person on the phone did not seem to care much but I took my chances.  As I was waiting for my package, I received a notification that it was ready for pick-up. The pick up location is over 15 minutes away, the main reason why I asked for a re-delivery. I went it got it myself as I didn't want to wait for a promise of re-delivery once again. One unhappy customer."
"They can’t even be bothered to deliver a package. I have 3 dogs at home and they didn’t make a sound, so I know he didn’t try to knock. I’ve been sitting across from the door all morning waiting! The best part is that customer service is almost as bad as the delivery! If I wanted to have to pick up my package, I would have chose that option. Sad that they get paid 2x more than minimum wage and they can’t even be bothered to do their jobs!! Thanks Purolator! 👍🏻Update to add: They just sent an email notification saying my package was out for delivery… an hour after “try to deliver”. What top notch service!"
"May,  2023 update: service has VASTLY  improved.  In and out in 5min despite some technical issues.2018 review:Rude, rude, rude staff!  Item arrived with a 6 inch hole in the box and when I pointed that out staff said ""Do you accept it or not?!""  Is this supposed to be customer service?  Did not advise me of other options - just accept broken box or not."
The Purolator office on Hawthorne has great customer service.If you have a large volume of waybills to make on their website the postal codes are a major pain.Billing can not give me an answer on the cost of over 800 deliveries. They say you have to put in the postal code for each delivery. Really? Wow.
"I had a package I ordered which i paid extra to next day delivery. It never arrived so I checked the tracking number and it said ""attempted delivery, client not home"" which was a lie. I work from home since Covid started and didn't see anyone attempt to come to my place on that day and time. Especially didn't see foot prints or tire tracks in snow. Also I didn't get the attempted delivery knocker on my door so it's all lies. I contacted head office and they were useless. They said they would get the depot manager to call me back and to expect it on Friday (got my package on Wednesday). Well surprise surprise... I didn't hear back from them. I called back Monday and it seems the depot used the excuse of ""too busy, will call when we have the time). So the head office sent another message insisting to call me back. I did finally hear back from a Brandi who was extremely unhelpful, useless and unapologetic. Instead of trying to help out the customer, she proceeded to only try to give me excuses why the driver didn't attempt the delivery (even though he clearly lied on his notes) and abruptly hung up the phone. I asked head office to speak to the regional manager.  The next day someone from head office called me back stating the regional manager wasn't going to call me back because it was beneath her to do so. Someone named Carolyn Hardie... I mean if you're too lazy to do anything then why keep working there?Avoid this company  there's a reason why Purolator isn't doing good and it's mostly due to poor customer relations. I've been reading other complaints about this depot and they all seem constant. I mean, what kind of idiot leaves a $1,000 laptop in plain sight to be stolen and forge a signature?"
"I have ordered several things shipped through Purolator and had a terrible experience. They always say no one was home, but we are always home on the delivery days and they literally do not even knock or try in any way to see if someone is home. I then have to drive out to this very inconvenient location. Packages I have brought here to return to Amazon somehow take weeks to over a month to be delivered. Avoid Purolator if you can."
"Have been Waiting for internet modem to be delivered for 3 days.Monday - the tracker says that my address needs to be changed because they couldn't get in my building (which is fine, makes sense). So Monday evening i called AND texted through chat telling them to make a note on my file to have the delivery driver call my cell on arrival so I could meet at the entrance.Tuesday - nothing. Called again and confirmed the delivery driver would call my cell, 100%.Wednesday - delivery driver leaves with my package in the morning, track the package all morning and before noon it says the package was undelivered because ""receiver unavailable"". THE DRIVER NEVER CALLED MY CELL PHONE.Pure laziness and incompetence.Tomorrow I have decided I will waste my own time to pick up my package from the facility.. I have a feeling it won't even be there and I will be stuck using phone data once again. Waste of time, effort, and money."
"Whatever bad review you read here Is just the truth. Want to confirm? Read every review  for purolator  for every city and I can guarantee you that it’s the same complaint over and over again. If I wanted to pick up a 65in tv with my car, I would never have opted for delivery. This is the worst delivery company I have ever come across. No regard for how urgent you need your items delivered. What exactly is the point of express shipping? I honestly feel during orientation (if they have any) the delivery personnel’s are told “do not knock, do not buzz, just slap the sorry we missed you sticker and keep it moving” .Not once, not twice  but more than 3 times they they slapped that sticker on my buzzer  and the most annoying thing is , I work from home . I made sure my phone was not silent just so I could recieve my package. I feel so sad when I see a company use purolator because I know I’d have to drive to a location to pick it up. If I wanted to drive, I would have gone to the store to buy the item directly. Imagine the people who have to bus to your location just because your delivery persons are incompetent.Then there’s the part where you reach the pickup location after two days and you’re told your package is still with the driver. And apparently , the drivers aren’t given a phone to call so there’s no way to contact them . I’m just so angry right now. It’s too much incompetencies. Honestly please just close down the whole delivery business and make it a pick up company because it’s useless."
"I don't understand the decision to move this facility to the middle of nowhere. I rented a car to drive out here to pick up my package, per the directions on my slip, only to be told that they decided to try to deliver it again, and that I ""wasn't home"" (which i was) and that I would have to come back.Whenever I get a notification that something I ordered will be delivered by Purolator I honestly just assume I won't get it because most of their drivers are too lazy to actually deliver anything. They just leave a slip and drive your package to the middle of nowhere and if you don't own a car, you're screwed. Most if the time I just tell them to send it back and hope next time it'll be delivered by a better company."
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. They are so inconsiderate! They don't even bother to ring your intercom and say they ""attempted delivery"". The worst part of it all is that after 1 ""attempt"", they bring your package to the most RANDOM location that is far from my house. I don't own a car so now I have to chose between an hour and a half bus ride or a 20 dollar Uber just to get there to pick up my stuff. So much for ""free shipping""! Outrageous. This is not the first time this happened to me. I've purchased from Zara and Best Buy and had the same experience with Purolator. I will from now on never order anything online without knowing for sure they don't use Purolator. The only thing is that the people that work at the pickup location are fine, it's just this whole experience that ends up being stressful, time consuming and expensive."
"I wish I could give less than 1 star to this company. They always fail to deliver. We are two people in the house and working from home, yet never received any package at home which is delivering by Purolator. I always had to go to pickup location. Their drivers don't even bother to ring a bell or contact like other delivery services do. Also when we went to pick up our package the lady over there was so unresponsive. Thanks to your poor service,  now we have decided to cancel all our order if we see its coming through Purolator."
"I cleared my schedule the day my package was supposed to be delivered so that I could be there to sign for it when they showed up. We'll I waited all day and then got a notification saying missed delivery even though they never came. This is a really expensive package and I didn't want to risk anything so I called them and changed the delivery to a pickup location right by me. The next day I get home in the evening and there's a missed delivery notification on my door and it says they've tried to deliver it but have now re-directed this package to a pick up location across town. I called again to see if this was a mistake and I was assured that I needed to ignore this, they were still delivering it to the location I selected beside me. I wake up the next day to check the shipping and they STILL delivered it to the pickup location across town. This is a 30 minute drive one way for me, and not the 1at time this has happened. Terrible service and communication. Get your customer service and local dispatchers on the same page!!"
"Has got to be the worst delivery service I have ever used. I wasn't home so they didn't drop off the package. Same thing the next day. Then I get a note saying I can't pick up my package for two more days. Four days of waiting because they won't drop off a package like every other company on the planet. Won't answer the phone, been on hold FOR AN HOUR, so I can find my item. The worst of all the delivery companies."
"The service at Hathorn rd 3330 was excellent, but I had to go there, because the delivery person did not bother to ring the doorbell the day before.Then I called purolator right away, and agreed on redelivery, which was not kept.Skipping details: their internal communications is shoddy.Also, when complaining today I got nothing but cynical BS from a supervisor.I saw it simpler and safer just to pick this 45 lbs item up myself, and cut the struggle short.I did get flowless service from them earlier in recent month's, but today's and yesterday's experience put their reliability in a serious doubt."
"If I could give 0 I would.Worst service everVery lazy delivery people, they came to the apartment without noticing neither par email, call or sms, than just sent a message to tell us know we missed the shipment... A SHIPMENT THAT WE HAD NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL ARRIVE, they think we do not have nothing special to do in our lives.I called back to have that delivery same day, they send a message letting me know that I have to go pick it up at their warehouse wish is 1 hour from my home.Never will do any business with that no responsible or professional company"
"I have been waiting for a package since Friday. Friday it said “delivery scheduled for next business day”, Monday came, and of course nothing. Tuesday I received an email that say “out for delivery” so I made sure we stayed home all day, not to miss it and nothing once again.Today, it still has the same “out for delivery” scan from Yesterday, so I don’t know if it will or won’t come.Calling customer service did not help at all, they appeared more clueless than me. This company expects you to wait around for a package all day for three days, but their driver won’t even wait a few minutes after knocking to hand you a package.Worst service, unprofessional and unreliable."
"My experience pretty much echoes everything that's been written here...Monday - attempted delivery, no slip left but I happened to find the tracker online through the website I ordered with.Tuesday - called to arrange a re-delivery since, as lots of people mentioned in other reviews, their depot is very out of the way and hard to get to if you don't have a car. The person I reached on the phone arranged for re-delivery on Wednesday from 8AM to 8PM.Wednesday - arranged to work from home so that I could wait for the package. Called at 3PM that day to confirm that it was still coming - the person on the phone confirmed that it would arrive by 8PM. It never came.Thursday - called again to say that my package wasn't delivered on Wednesday and was told that it would be delivered today ""from 8AM to 8PM""... and it never came...I imagine I'll have to find some way to get to the depot at some point to pick it up. I realize it's a busy season for them, but they're a courier company... you'd think they'd anticipate the increased workload and have worked out some of these kinks by now..."
"The staff at the Depot we're extremely helpful, kind and patient when I came by to try to pick up something that wasn't even set for pick up!They made the effort to find the needle in the haystack for me, which I'm sure they didn't have to, and they didn't make me feel bad for the extra work I caused them."
"They have the worst driver in the entire country. I canceled my Amazon Prime for shipping with them. I told AP the only reason I buy off Amazon because you send these local delivery people. That they have never failed to deliver. One time they send a package with Purolator ""of course it didn't arrive"" I told AP, anyone do business with Purolator, I cut them off my life. Despite I have been working from home for the last 16 months, I have never ever received a package by Purolator or Canada post. I have to go pick it up myself. And if I order something online and I see Purolator or Canada post, I immediately stop the order."
"My package was not delivered to my apartment, the courier did not call the number provided, leave a notice, or attempt to call me through the directory. I had to use my tracking number online to find out my package was at the depot and they were not going to attempt to deliver it again. I showed up at the depot to watch the employee at the front desk repeatedly go into the warehouse to pressure their personnel to look for a package for a child's birthday for the lady in front of me in line. They said it was there but ""inaccessible"" and the customer would have to return at the end of the week. This is all absolutely unacceptable."
"Bad location, difficult to access by public transit. The lady at the service desk was very presumptuous when my girlfriend told her that she was picking up a package that wasn’t hers. She immediately said that she couldn’t do it before even hearing that my girlfriend had all the necessary documentation and that we could in fact pick up the package. I think just a little more patience with the customer would be nice, especially after we took an hour and a half long triple-transfer bus ride to get there."
"Rude and incompetent employees working here.  I have never had as much problems picking up a parcel anywhere in my life as I have at this place.  Avoid going to this location, you probably won't get your package there especially if Purolator refuses to deliver the package and instead sneak up and stick a sticker on the door just so they don't have to carry anything more then a piece of paper.  Use FedEx or Canada Post.  Warning on Canada Post as they like to send parcels back and forth over the border just to make money(1 international charge each time it crosses the border)"
"They came to my apartment and left a note without delivering the package. They didn't even care to give me a call or even to press the buzzer. The note said that I need to pick up the package from a location which is very far from Ottawa (surrounded by highways and nothing else). I had to take an hour long bus from Ottawa city centre and get off at the last stop, and then walk in minus 6 degree centigrade for three quarter a kilometer to reach the destination. When I reached the place the lady in the front desk told me that from next time onward if I give them a call,  they will keep my package in a location which is more accessible by bus. Great. They are pretty much sure that same thing will happen with my next package as well. And if it happens they would not even bother to rearrange the delivery. I took an Uber to get back to my place because there were no direct bus route back. My question is, what is the point of ordering a stuff online if I have to go through so much hassle? I wounder why companies like Amazon still uses their service!!When I got back to my apartment, guess what happened?There was another note from the same company for someone else. So you can pretty much guess what is going on. I would avoid this company in any possible way."
"Delivery driver never rang doorbell. Waiting for a package that has been in town for over a week. Status hasn't even been updated online. Can't get through to anyone. Told to go pick up package all the way across town when there's a purolator location 3 minutes away. Driver left notice when we were home. No knock on door. No doorbell ring. Unable to find out any information on the package. Was told it wouldn't be delivered on the weekend, and the driver did a fake drop off at 10 am on a Sunday when we were home. What is this? What kind of service quality is this? Poor delivery. Poor Service. Zero follow up. Zero updates. Whoever the driver is, and whoever manages the Hawthorne location should be fired. This is more than just an excess of deliveries during the holiday season, this is a complete slap in the face to people who value their time and need their deliveries. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT deal with them if you don't have too. This has been incredibly frustrating, with absolutely zero customer service to help deal with this. They are the least reliable delivery service in Ottawa. I would be ashamed to treat anyone with the same amount of disrespect. You have zero accountability and purolator should be embarrassed that this is how their company is being represented."
"I wish I could give 0 stars and sadly can't. This company cannot do anything simple for some reason. I order stuff regularly and there is never any problem delivering from other shipping companys. Purolator has lazy workers that just leave slips taking the convenience of my amazon prime away. First I get a location to pick up my package that is an hour away. I decide to call and when finally connected to an agent after 30 min, they say they will rearrange the delivery and it will arrive in 2 days. I had no problem with that. I wait and the package still doesn't arrive after the 2 days. I decide to call the next day, waiting on the phone for another 30 min and get told the package will be delivered tomorrow. I still haven't received the package and I am fuming. I decided to call again and now they don't know until the agent with my package responds and it might take another 1-2 business days. My package is already over a week late and will now take longer. Most unreliable, slow and horrible company I have dealt with. I wish e-shopping places like Amazon would tell who would deliver the package as I would have never ordered if I knew Purolator would deliver."
"Was expecting a package for about a week and since day one the tracking system says ""rescheduled for the next business day"".  I would have happily gone and picked it up myself but they said you can't do that yet. after three days calling and waiting in line for 30min and getting the response ""it's been delayed and rescheduled for the next business day"" like I cannot read, they updated the tracking as ""delayed due to missed delivery"" I checked everywhere and didn't find a notice of missed delivery at the door. And now it's Saturday noon and gotta wait until Monday to see what's going on. Took three days off work last week waiting for that ""next business day"" at home so there wouldn't be a missed delivery but now..."
"Got a notification mentioning the following: ""Attempted delivery - receiver inaccessible"" - Which is totally not true since I was at home all day urgently waiting for this package. Called Customer Service, had to listen to music for 45 minutes, finally got an agent and she mentioned she would call the dispatcher to get the driver to re-attempt the delivery. Got a notification 4 hours later saying that the package was ready to be picked up at Spic and Span Ottawa on Richmond Road.  Opening hours are 9:30 to 3:30 and since I got the notification at 3:36PM, I wasn't able to get my package. Called Customer support again... Finally spoke to another useless agent after a 42 minutes wait. The agent agreed that it was unacceptable but didn't have any resolution and said he would have someone call me in the morning.... Still waiting for the call.  Went to pick up my package at Spic and Span at 9:45AM the next morning and was greeted by a piece of paper stating that they would be back at 11AM. Unreal!  Even the pickup locations are not managed properly.  I didn't have a choice this time, but will certainly keep selecting a true shipping/logistic company in the future (Fedex, UPS and DHL are soooo much better) and will avoid dealing with these clowns at Purolator."
"Waited on hold for 25 minutes after getting a notice my package was here, very excited because I had been checking every five minutes for it! Needless to say extremely disappointed when I saw a notice that I had to go to Purolator the next day because they didn’t even make an effort to deliver it and just left the note there. And then I couldn’t speak to an actual human about it, very unreliable delivery."
"Attempted delivery, no slip was left for pick up, called customer service twice. Once they had no idea where the package was. The second I was supposed to get an email for pick up, got 0 email.Always so complicated to get your mail from this company. If I was the shipper, would never recommend. Always inconvenient for the receiver."
"So my parents had sent me this really important package that's had to come the next morning (today) going from Barrie to Ottawa in Ontario. Im in an apartment building so we left them with my phone number and told them to call when they got there if they couldn't get into my building. So I wake up at 7am, go outside every 30 min to an hour to check if they've arrived, I check again at 9am and this paper was stuck on my mailbox from INSIDE my building saying they got there at 8:45am and MISSED ME. If they got into my building they could have easily knocked but they just stuck the paper and left. No phone calls, no knock, NO NOTICE. The package was extremely important, the drivers have to treat every package to be the most important thing to that customer. No care was given for my package and me receiving it. I called customer service and said the driver could bring it to me tomorrow? I definitely need it today so I have to pick it up later today even when I payed extra for it to get here in the morning. I get it, the driver's tired, but when you get to your destination the most important part of your job is to make sure it gets in the customers hands, so the easiest thing to do is, knock. Now I have to miss really important events to pick up my package later today. So this is quite unfortunate."
"Highly disappointed by the delivery service. On usual days if buzzer code is not available, delivery would be attempted next day, because they don’t care to call person on phone as FedEx or DHL does. On the other days, when complete address with buzzer code is mentioned, the delivery guys don’t even attempt to enter buzzer code, n schedule it for next day, without even getting out of the truck. Had to request them to make it a pickup. Very poor service, highly unreliable."
"One of the worst shipping service ..!!!I called call centre and after wasting 30 min the customer rep told me to that it’s at warehouse and i can pick up the package from there. I drove 55 min to just get there and i have told by warehouse employees that “Unfortunately they don’t have packages..!!!! It’s still with driver.!!I asked for Warehouse in-charge/ Manager name , She strictly denied and she said she can’t give Manager/ Person in-charge name.So basically i waste my 3 hours and 2 hours drive for NOTHING..!!I STILL DON’T HAVE MY PACKAGE..!!"
"I went in on Saturday to return two packages from Amazon. I never use Purolator but Amazon has a new thing where if you choose Purolator or UPS you do not have to package your own items they'll package them for you. So there's a Canada Post very close to me but knowing that I don't have to package my own items I took the trip out to Purolator for this specific reason. As soon as I got to the counter, I gave her the items, and the the first thing she said was ""did you not keep the boxes in the packaging materials""? I told her literally the only reason I came to Purolator is because with Amazon you don't have to repackage in the original Box which I already recycled. She said ""okay ill go find some packaging"" 🧐 it was not worth the gas to go to this Purolator, bad location, next time I'll keep the packaging materials and judt go to the Canada Post closer to me."
I was waiting for a small package for a few days. It said the delivery would be on Dec 3 but when I checked the tracker on the 3rd it showed the last check in as Toronto (I’m in Ottawa). I wasn’t so fussed about this as I know during the holidays things are busy. Yesterday on Dec 5 I was home all day until about 8pm. Today I check my mail room and I found a delivery slip that says they attempted to deliver my package at 6:38pm. There was no call nor attempt to deliver to me. I now have to go to their branch over an hour bus ride to pick up my package. This is unacceptable service. I work every day 9-6 and I don’t have 2 hours to spare to bus out there because their delivery driver couldn’t be bothered to take the elevator and knock on my door or even call me. I am totally furious. Worse I tried to call Purolator and after waiting on the phone for 30 minutes the call was dropped.
This company is the worst!! Said Item was out for delivery. Check the status again it says attempted delivery receiver inaccessible. I took day off work to be here to receive my package. I live in a apt builing on a main street. Called customer service was on hold for 49 min when i hung up thinking maybe a glitch. Call back on hold for another 38 min. Unacceptable period!!!! Still no package! So frustrated and out a days pay for nothing!!! Funny how another courier was able to deliver another package to my front door no hassle no problem but Purolator couldnt deliver my package an hour earlier!
"Purolator hates apartment buildings and has made it company policy that their drivers shouldn't attempt a delivery unless your door code is written in three-foot high letters taped to the truck's front windshield, even if it's something mind-numbingly obvious like, say, your apartment number, and there's a perfectly functioning directory in the front entry of your building. Seriously this is just the worst company around, it's hard to even call them a courier since they don't try to deliver anything. Their customer service line is friendly and nice at the very least, but also completely worthless since the drivers and the depot just ignore them in their crusade to never get a package to where it's going on time."
"I can genuinely say that I have NEVER had a good experience from Purolator. Every single delivery I've ever had has been butchered by their team.The delivery drivers have on three separate occasions made claims that they attempted to deliver my boxes.For two of these instances I was either at home on a day off or working from home during Covid. (So I wasn't going anywhere)The first package was time sensitive and needed for work.The drivers make no attempt to contact you or knock at your door.They simply walk up to the door and leave.Most recently was a package to be delivered on Friday, for another piece I need for MY JOB.It was marked urgent and I WORK FROM HOME,I was here all day.At 10:30 am on Friday I went and checked the Purolator tracking and it said there was already a delivery attempt and that the package would have to be pushed back to Monday.I was unable to reach someone in office or pick up the package that day so I was completely screwed over.Let me add that there is a buzzer in my building for my unit as well as my email and number on the account for delivery with no contact.I'm always under the belief that if you are going to offer a service, you are there to fulfil this service.By that logic, Purolator needs a huge reform.If you're delivering something to friends or family over the holidays, and you want them to get it in time for Christmas, use any other service than Purolator."
"I got an automated phone call that they attempted to deliver, but my apartment buzzer goes directly to my phone, which was in front of me all day and I had no missed calls so the driver never buzzed. Now my item is in the middle of nowhere and I can't come get it because their location is inaccessible without a car. If they had rung the buzzer I could have buzzed them in and saved myself an hour and half ride each way or just never getting my packageUpdate: I complained to Amazon, they said they'd request it be redelivered, again I received an automated voice call saying my package is being held for pick up, again no attempt to buzz me was made because I have my phone in front of me waiting for them and I do not have any missed calls from my buzzer or otherwise"
"I really wanted to give Purolator the benefit of the doubt but I've now had 3 major issues with delivery with them, before, during and after the recent Canada Post strike, so I don't think it has anything to do with that.I don't have a car and love utilizing Amazon Prime, but every time something is shipped through Purolator it either doesn't come or they ""attempt delivery"" and then make me bus over an hour to get my package at their Hawthorne location.I ordered a large package and left a note on the front door of my complex with my buzz number and also made sure to put in on my shipping address. I get a message at 11pm that night stating they attempted delivery earlier, when in reality they didn't even bother to try and bring it into the building and didn't leave it at the door of my apartment like I had asked (I made sure to leave a nice message on the entryway door of my apartment complex as I wasn't too sure when the package would arrive). I now have to bus over an hour and then walk 15 minutes to the pick up spot and then pay for an Uber XL, which will be over $20, to get this package home because I don't own a vehicle. I will also need someone to help me as this package is heavy and don't own a dolly.I also have had a package that was supposed to be delivered on November 15th that has not arrived yet and every day I receive emails from their tracking/tracing specialists stating that they're going to make sure it comes soon. It's ridiculous, this has been almost 3 weeks and every day the tracking information updates to delivery rescheduled for next day. The people have been polite in their emails, but unfortunately nothing has come out of it.Other times they have put down a message that they missed me when in reality I have been home all day and didn't get a knock on the door -- they just don't want to bring it up to my apartment. I honestly don't even mind coming downstairs to grab it for them as I understand they probably have a lot of deliveries, but this would require them to buzz me or call me so that I can come downstairs.I can understand if the package is a day or two late as I know Cyber Monday and Black Friday plus holiday shopping has caused an influx of orders. But the lack of communication and not even attempting to deliver the product is what really bothers me.I am going to start cancelling my Prime orders if I see they are being shipped by Purolator and maybe this will push Amazon to start using a different delivery company."
"Was supposed to have next day delivery with Amazon Prime. Admittedly my location isn't one where you could just leave a package because I live on a busy street and I don't have a buzzer. However, I was home all day on 2 occasions and instead of calling to notify me that they had arrived I received an email of a delivery attempt. They claimed they couldn't find my address though I've never had this issue with any other carrier service. Finally, at the end of a week I received a notification that it had been delivered though it wasn't to my place. After calling Amazon (for the second time regarding this issue)I learned that they left it at a drop off location nearby (obviously without leaving me with this information be it through email or delivery notice). They just dropped the ball all over the place."
"After staying home from work all day to receive my package that was listed as out for delivery, I did not receive my package. The driver listed the delivery as attempted- meanwhile our buzzer was never rung and no attempt was made to see if anyone was home. The company's solution to this is to tell you they can attempt delivery the next day (but not even give you a window of delivery time so you can try to be home or ensure your package is the first to be delivered that day so you can just leave for work later), pick it up at the depot on the other side of the city, or- and this is only offered as an option if you tell them you are unable to go to the depot- send it to a slightly closer location. The last option being the most preferable but still means that depending on the size and weight of your package you are stuck paying extra to either bus or cab to and from the location- and of course, taking more time out of your day after already losing an entire day waiting for this incompetent company."
"I've noticed whenever my package is over sized, the drivers don't seem to bother delivering it to your door, they just slap an attempt delivery notice. Don't bother complaining to the company it's useless. Thankfully the concierge at our building often catches him leaving attempt delivery notice and notifies him the tenants our home. Best thing you can do is complain to amazon customer support, and hopefully amazon rethinks it's relation with this specific location down the line."
"Too bad I cannot give them Zero Rating, between all the mail delivering companies they are the company that loses packages the most. I will never use them, too bad that the companies that I order items from use them to deliver my packages and every second time they lose my package.Called three times and went to their warehouse in Ottawa, they have no idea where is the package, it has not been delivered to wrong address either, based on their tracking number it is still in their warehouse or stolen by their staff. This supposed to be a Christmas gift. This is company is a joke."
"The last half dozen deliveries from Purolator have been left in the unsecured lobby of my building!!!  I am retired. My ring number is on each package. The driver doesn't even try to reach me.So ... I went to the Purolator warehouse on Hawthorne Rd in Ottawa (it is very near my house) and explained that this has been happening.  I did so because there is no local phone number to contact them, just the toll-free North American number.  At the warehouse, I was told I was not contacted because the package was designated ""no signature required"" and the driver didn't need to come to my door, BUT they did acknowledge that he should NOT be leaving my package in the unsecured area.  I was told that a note would be left with the shift supervisor. That mustn't have happened or the driver didn't care because the very next day, he did it again!!The thing is, most of my packages are designated ""no signature required' but all of the other courier companies - even Canada Post - ring my buzzer and come to my door to deliver the parcel.  I fail to understand why the Purolator driver does not do this.I will be contacting the toll-free number to complain again. Very maddening."
"Very important package was supposed to be delivered overnight - parts required for a snowmobile trip.  Notified delivery was yesterday, waited all day, received email at end of day that delivery was missed.  Whatever that means - they didn't make it here.  Guaranteed delivery the next day.Next day passes, at 1:30pm I am assured both of my items are on a truck and coming to me.  Tracking numbers show nothing online because the packages are in limbo.  A Truck arrives at 4:30 - only one item is there.I will say, however, that the driver who special delivered our one item (it was the only item in his truck) got on the phone, tracked down our other package, and put us in touch with the Manager, and we got a solution - and believe it or not, our driver went back to Ottawa, retrieved our second package, and brought it back to Kemptville, at 6:30pm.  That's service.20 stars to our driver, Sebastien - and 4 for Purolator for at least fixing their mistake and going out of their way to resolve for us."
"Very unimpressed with the delivery men/women of Purolator. Not only did they barely attempt to delivery my package, but they expected me to take an hour and a half bus to pick up a package that they were too lazy to deliver after 3 ""attempts"". While customer service has been thoughtful and responsive, their delivery method is too poor for me to ever consider having a package delivered with their services again."
Similar to a lot of the reviews here...Purolator claims the package was delivered. The driver never bothered to even show up. I work from home with a clear view of my front door.Opened a case but it was closed after the driver claimed it was delivered to the front door...full circle achieved.Use any other service if you can.
"Their drivers are absolutely terrible. First time around, I had something shipped to me and the driver buzzed to me while I was at work. I said I wasn't home and he said I would have to pick it up at the store, but he didn't leave a tag with the tracking number or the location. I complained when I called in to get the tracking number and the next day the product was at my front door? This made me question what the problem was before.Second time, I order a $1500 laptop and they dropped it off to a reception (my building doesn't have one). I asked next door (which does have a reception) and they didn't receive a package either. Cross-referenced with the delivery information only and it seems they delivered to the wrong address altogether. Called customer service and complained and they said they would get back to me within a day, but I never got a call back. So as of this point, I am filing a claim against them for lost parcel and following up with a police report for potential theft.Purolator is terrible! Don't use them if you can avoid them. I'd rate 0 if I could."
Update:  No true followup from management.   Continuation of packages being dropped off at 710 rather than 700.   Amazon delivery people are far superior.  Please arrange for your drivers get trained by  the Amazon delivery people.  It's sad that the Amazon delivery  people are under paid but they deliver.  It's really sad to see Purolator drivers being over paid and not delivering.It's unbelievable how bad the service is.  Driver refuses to go to the front door of building.  Safe building and good neighborhood.  700 Coronation Ave.  Ottawa.    Refuses to call.  Demands 4 digest # to get access.   He still has to use the front door.  4 diget # for unit is plainly visable on call center at entrance.   Delivers parcels ment for 700 to 710 next to us and tells the postal delivery guy to bring the package for him.  Good thing the postal workers are on the ball.
"Ugh.  An important envelop was scheduled for delivery today , they didn't deliver it because of no ""buzzer code"".  Did the driver even come in the building because he would have seen a bright orange post it by the buzzer with my buzzer code.   I took  today off today, waited all day for the package and nothing. I contacted the sender and got the tracking number to see that you guys have been trying to deliver the package for 2 days. Why didn't you even bother to try and call me ? Did the guy even come in the building? He would have seen the buzzer code when he came in.  Now I have to take time off work on Saturday, run down to Hawthorne and pick up the package myself.  I'm so not happy . I've seen the driver before and he makes no effort to deliver packages, goes to the door and leaves."
"We have been using Purolator pretty much exclusively for our business for 4 years and we were always happy with them. In August 2019 our driver has changed and since then we have nothing but troubles - we never receive doorknockers (slips about attempted delivery and that the package is to be picked up) and that results in delays for our clients or returning shipments to our vendors, that we never were informed about until we contacted the vendors.I called the customer center to file complaint, and was told that the manager of Ottawa office will contact me, but so far no word. I tried reaching manager by going to the location and was told it is not possible. At this point I am at odds! How such good service can go down so quickly is surprising and disappointing."
"This courier has always been somewhat below par. I get many things delivered regularly for business and personal reasons. In the last 3-4 weeks, however, they have been positively terrible. Deliveries I get on a regular basis without issue now have “multiple attempts”. But I never receive a call from the buzzer downstairs, I am only informed when it is available for me to go and pickup elsewhere, usually on the other side of town. Purolator really needs to pull their socks up, especially while smaller companies are doing a far better job with fewer resources and staff. I have spent more time in the last 3 weeks on the phone or chat trying to fix Purolator’s mistakes, than I ever have in the last 5 years. So disappointing."
"Never ever use Purolator if you have an alternative. My workplace sent me a package so I was forced to deal with this choice of courier.Purolator's delivery driver brought the package to my building, then didn't even attempt the buzzer (I know because I would be able to see in my call history the missed buzzer board call),  and instead went along their merry way with the ""sorry we missed you! "" note. I call them over the weekend and after an hour and a half on hold I am able to request they redeliver and actually try the buzzer. Of course they arbitrarily cannot simply leave it in my lobby like Amazon would,  even though this option would have been perfectly fine with me.The delivery driver again does not attempt the buzzer  and instead opts to leave me the ol note that I have to come pick it up at this location in the middle of nowhere.Truly awful service. I urge all to avoid using them if there is literally any other alternative available."
"A nightmare.  We requested overnight delivery because we needed to urgently receive a package the following day.  The driver apparently said he could not access our office even though all he had to do was enter the front door and walk on a few stairs.We called and called through the day asking when the package would be delivered.  We were told maybe it would come or maybe it wouldn't or maybe we could go at 8pm to their head office and pick it up (which would be too late and was not doable).  We had a client drive for 2 hours to our office to pick up the urgently needed package only not to have it arrive.  Throughout the day while calling Purolator other couriers arrived at our office from other companies, without the slightest difficulty.Considerable scrambling and wasted time, expenses and money have been incurred trying to get our package that we paid to be delivered, delivered.  We offered to drive anywhere in the City to meet the driver and get the package if he could not come back. Purolator said they had no way of contacting their driver to arrange this and there was nothing they could do to help us. We were promised it would be delivered in the AM a day late.It is now a day later approaching noon and the package STILL has not been delivered. A complete disaster.  We are on the phone with them now (on a lengthy hold).  Their website now falsely says we gave them the wrong address, even though we called them THREE TIMES yesterday telling them the correct address and our address was correct the first time we gave it to them. Avoid this company at all costs.  One star rating is too generous.Update: it is now 2:30pm a day late on delivery of an urgent package we were promised would be delivered this AM today after numerous phone calls.  Purulator's office tells us they actually didn't even send it out to be delivered at all today.I cannot imagine how a courier service could possibly be so incompetent.  It is amazing."
"Similar to other reviewers, I also did not receive a phone call or a buzz when the delivery attempt was made. Other shipping companies have typically been allowed entry into my building and will often knock on the actual door of the unit - however I would consider this level of service above and beyond. At least get a hold of the customer.However - once I arrived at the depot, the staff were very helpful and welcoming. They let me borrow a dolly and also accepted my excess packaging for recycling. Depot staff = 5 stars. Initial delivery effort = 1 star."
"This is the worst customer service I have ever received. Don't deliver to my my house, make me go all the way to Hawthorne rd. Called to get the deadline for send back extended or to work out a delivery schedule. They couldn't figure out either one. Home delivery between 8am and 8pm is insane some of us have jobs. Your a parcel delivery service and you cant deliver a package or have a reasonable pick up location. Its insane. The person I spoke to refused to transfer me to customer service to make a complaint. The worst service. DO NOT GET THIS COMPANY TO DELIVER PACKAGES IN OTTAWA. They will just make you pick it up in an industrial area in the middle of nowhere."
"If I could leave negative stars I would. I don’t even know where to start with this dishonest company. From the notifications that they need correction on an address they’ve delivered packages to on multiple occasions to a notification that there’s been some sort of mechanical delay. Then it gets better they show up to my apartment building leave my package in between the doors to get in and leave. To top it all off they opened my package and re tapped it. I have pictures to prove it all, shameful practices and dishonest employees and staff. If I could never have anything shipped through their services I would."
"As much as my review of another location was glowing, this one is quite the opposite.  The driver is simply unable to read the label: he's constantly saying there's no entry code, when I'm fact it's there in plain sight.  First complaint has yet to receive a response from the depot, despite a promise that there would be one within 24-48 hours.  A second complaint has yielded the same non-response.  I also arranged for one shipment to be held at the depot for pickup.  One box was held, the other one was put back on the truck.  It was at my home for a delivery attempt at the very moment I was at the depot.   When I told the agent aboity complaints and lack of response, she said they were likely very busy.  Just like the drivers that are too busy to read the labels or even look up names in the building directory.   Seems everyone at Purolator is too busy to do their jobs.   I have no choice to receive these shipments by Purolator, so will I be chasing packages for the next while?"
"Update, one month on, different delivery:Visited depot with door note again (no problem - no one in this time) only to be told my package was moved to another town 2 hours away. No reason. Polite, but no apology. Would drop to half a star if I could. Genuinely; thanks to front line staff for your no doubt hard work, but an apology would have been lovely and I'd have smiled and left us both happier.Staff at dept were great. But tracking did not reflect major stop (arrival in my city), and delivery was classic, people in house but note left on door to go pick up."
"Through all the covid stuff happening, Purolator has been by far the BEST courier for my packages so far. They state on their website that there could be a 1-3 day delay on top of your normal waiting time, which is to be expected during a major health crisis such as the one going on, yet all 3 times I’ve used them so far they have shown up EARLIER than my expected delivery date!!! That’s amazing! Kudos to Purolator for keeping up with the shipping demand, I know it has skyrocketed the last couple months but it’s nice to see that they can stay on-top of it and I can count that I will get my package in good time from them."
"What a nightmare to order something online that would be delivered by this courier! and you never know! Each time, I have to take two buses (about 2 hours) to go there to pick up a silly parcel! and then two more hours to return. Takes me a whole day! I have to walk for half an hour from the nearest bus stop, on a remote area which is really scary and unsafe! Why doesn't the driver even try to deliver it to my address?! Very disappointed! I wish I could give 0 stars!"
"A warning - just don't. Our delivery was brought in to our reception desk, not left with our reception staff (?), and then brought to the Purolator warehouse on the other side of the city from us. When we called to confirm that we could pick it up (since they wouldn't deliver it), they needed us to arrange with the sender to fax special permission. Delay, hassle - okay. It's Friday and the package was to be delivered Monday, we can finally pick it up so let's count our blessings. Unfortunately, the tracking number we were given by the Purolator agent only applied to one of 3 boxes, so I was given only one box at the depot - no mention of other boxes. I get home after more than an hour, and notice supplies missing. I call again, and am told that two other boxes are there with two different tracking numbers attached to them. Even though I just spent more than an hour of my day driving to get something that they were paid to deliver, they will not deliver the two other boxes and have left me with the options of driving back to pick up the remaining boxes or pay a premium for a private local courier to deliver them for me. I'd like to assume that this was a fluke, but even so, Purolator's customer service response was basically non-existant. I expect more accountability from a shipping company, and you should too."
"Final Final Edit: I emailed purolator, and they reattempted delivery. Screwed it up again, left a voicemail on my phone saying they would leave a slip. No slip on my front door, and on the website it is marked as ""delivered"" so they're just actually stealing my stuff. When can we run this business out of town?Final edit: they got me my tablet, but for some reason they did not deliver my $50 quilt and refuse to even attempt it and expect me to just pay over $100 in UBERs during the second wave to go get it. Honestly, screw you Purolator. I already explained how my husband is high risk, taking an UBER is too dangerous.Edit to add: Just received a call from them, within one hour of the ""attempted delivery"", that they will try to come back and deliver the packages to me right now, and if not, they will come tomorrow (when they are supposedly closed). We will see how this goes.I can't recall a single time in the entire time I've been (unwillingly, thank you Amazon for not letting us pick which carrier we want) serviced by these clowns that they've actually delivered anything properly or on time. Half the apartment buildings in this city operate off of buzzers and every single time they don't even bother to try using it. I was expecting a $2000 delivery today and they couldn't be bothered to attempt to type in the number of my apartment to see if I could come out, couldn't call me, they waited to ping Amazon that the delivery was ""attempted"" until it was after they ""closed"" so even though I called within 30 seconds of being notified, I now have to either risk my health and my husband's health travelling to go get it on Tuesday during the second wave of COVID or I can wait until Wednesday for them to ""attempt to deliver"" again. Sick to death of this company. I'd honestly blacklist myself to them if I knew how."
"This has happened to me twice already. I received no notice of attempted deliveries. No calls, no e-mail, nothing. Instead of taking my parcels to the nearby pick up location (which is only a 5 minute walk from where I live), in both instances it gets dropped off at the Purolator here. The commute here is 1 hour and 17 minutes each way by bus, not to mention the long walk it is from the nearest bus stop. I guess Purolator assumes that everyone has a car to pick up their parcels or even has the time to go 14.5km to pick up their package. By far the worst experience I've had with any delivery service. With UPS or Fedex, I didn't have to walk farther than 3 blocks to a pick-up location. Canada Post was no more than 2 blocks. I had to call customer service to even find out where my package was, and they have 0 sympathy on the phone. I just hope my future orders will never have to go through Purolator."
"I was home all day, however the driver claimed to have attempted delivery- all without leaving an attempted delivery slip. I called customer service later that day, and the rep confirmed that I had all the necessary information for proper delivery (I included my buzzer). Obviously just a driver that doesn’t want to do his/her job. This reflects very poorly on the company.I suggest using Canada Post. Even during the strike I never had issues."
"delivery guy list delivery as attempted receiver unavailable,  this happened twice, to my work where there's cameras at all entrances, driver didn't attempt to deliver anything and says I have to go pick it up at the warehouse. customer service doesn't do anything about the matter even tho I have proof the driver lied. by far the worst courier company."
"I'm honestly beyond disappointed with the work ethics of the delivery drivers. Twice in a row a delivery worker left a giant parcel at my doorstep without even knocking or ringing the door bell, and just drove away. I was home both times and would have answered (and thankfully brought the parcels in right away), but even if I wasn't home my parcels would have sat on my doorstep ripe for any person to steal them. I couldn't believe that the drivers didn't have any interest to knock/ ring at the door! It really feels like they couldn't care at all. If my parcel had been stolen, who would be held accountable? Purolator certainly wouldn't have given a monkey's arse about it and the seller wouldn't be able to provide a refund because the item would have been, ""technically"", delivered, thus I could have been scammed out of a parcel and my money. I am beyond disgusted with the lack of professionalism and the sheer lack of empathy shown by the delivery workers. Absolutely unacceptable. I will make sure to never have any future parcels delivered by Purolater. Shame on this company."
Absolutely ridiculous. Stayed home 3 different days to wait for package. It NEVER arrived. They phoned me THREE times (once each day) to make sure they have the right ring number. Still no package. I think these retards get off on making people waste their time. They make absolutely NO effort to deliver NOR do they appear to have a single brain cell to figure out problems. The drivers don't carry a phone (duh) to call you in case they run into a problem. So they waste your time and don't give a turd. They also tell you at customer service that they don't have phone numbers for managers. I am still waiting on hold to talk to one of their morons. He apparently has to e-mail to them to make contact.
"I have been in hold for over 2 hours. My package was not delivered as it was supposed to be due to the suite number missing a 0. I was told this morning everything was fixed and good to go, my package would be in today. It’s not. 2 hours on hold is absolutely ridiculous, there is no way they haven t had a chance to take me call in that period of time. When calling, it stated that my wait time was over 10min. This is insane."
"Like so many others on this page I have been misled and disappointed by Purolators service. Was home all day, and received an email saying that my package was undeliverable. Soonest they could dispatch it for a second delivery attempt was 3 days later. No notice on my door, and clearly no attempt was made to deliver. The item expected was something I was relying on for work and made special arrangements to be available to receive. They will not put the same effort in. If you have a choice in shipping, Purolator would not be high on my list of recommendations."
"I continue to be repeatedly disappointed by Purolator. The work ethic and poor customer service of the company is clearly shown by the the poor two point two rating that they hold in this forum.I was expecting a delivery yesterday,  and although I stayed home all day to recieve my parcel, I was greeted by an ""attempted delivery"" notification. This is the classic move of the Purolator deliverymen/women. They never attempt to ring the door bell or knock on the door. They jump out of their vehicles with an attempted delivery notification, and place it on the door. It's quite interesting, because their reason for not being able to deliver my parcel was stated as ""incorrect address."" Oddly enough this is the same address I have been using for the last few years. If other mail carriers are able to read and identify the words and numbers of my address, why can't Purolator?I have told Amazon to place a note avoiding the use of Purolator when delivering items from my account. If I'm paying for one day prime shipping, my delivery should be made in one day. This has gotten out of hand. I can understand if it happened on one occassion, but it's been too numerous to accept."
"This is a joke. I ordered for bed frame from amazon. The delivery was scheduled for 29. Checked the website and they had weather issues as reason for the delay. So i called on 30th and 1 may and i was told my package was given to an external courier to deliver and i would receive it by end of day may 1st. They later updated the tracking information with attempts to deliver on 29th April failed and pick up at ottawa. Be honest and tell the truth. You never tried to deliver anything. I was home form 27 till date and i work in front of my unit door. If you said you tried how was the package given to an external courier on 30th and how come the call centre personal confirmed my package will be delivered on 1st may. Secondly, if a package was being delivered and failed, a note is left behind to tell you where to pickup. Nothing like that. No information on where to pickup. Simply go to every purolator in Ottawa to find your package. What a service.!!!!!"
"This morning, I awoke to my tracking info declaring that my package was out for delivery. I looked outside and even saw a Purolator van parked just up the street so I figured it would just be a matter of minutes until I get my package. An hour had passed by so I checked my tracking info and I'm alarmed to see ""attempted delivery"". The Purolator delivery person was on my street. I had my phone with me the whole time in anticipation. They did not even stop by my place. They did not even leave a slip saying where to pick it up. They did not attempt a delivery. This is the third time this scenario has happened to me. It looks like I'm not the only one.To make things even better, their only pickup facility is in the middle of nowhere, making it ridiculously inconvenient to pick up a package."
"Awful, awful courier. I chose express shipping with an online retailer who chooses to use Purolator Express as their shipper. The shipment left the origin point and arrived in my city quickly enough, but then spent the following 48 hours in the local depot. I called once, asked them to hold for pickup so I can likely get it quicker, and was told they know where my package is and just need to move it to the retail front; shouldn't take long. 24 hours later, I call again, and am told its in a freight and has yet to be unloaded. How can an express courier, expected to ship a package in 1-2 business days, allow a package to sit in freight for 2 business days? At the current expected delivery date, it will be equal to if I were to have just had it shipped via Canada Post for free.Awful courier. Never has UPS, DHL, or Fedex received a product of mine and just let it sit for days. Never again will I purchase anything shipped by this awful, incompetent operation."
"I believe that Purolator is targeting customers and going to homes that suit their own needs, not the consumer's needs. When we order our packages we deserve to get them on the time that it says on the package through the required terms of service and privacy policy that is laid out by Purolator and the company. And if the company can not do the services that they are required to do then I think people should stop using the service because they can't be trusted."
"A package that was supposed to be delivery sunday took 6 days to be on my hands.Firs they didnt find address,and it took them 2 days to send it back to delivery then apparently driver only knew one way to my place where there is a construction so he was unable to deluvery it , then i ask them that ill do a pick up in a close location to my place, my package always ended up in transit to delivery even with all the notes and 5 calls daily i was doing. I ended up giving up and picked up at this location (main one in ottawa) which its a 40min drive (one way only) until the day 6!Such a lack of organization and communication I WOULD NEVER EVER SEND SOMETHING THROUGH THEM OR WILL EXPECT TO RECEIVE A PACKAGE ON TIME...!!!Plus my packages were all damaged."
"Horrible service. This is the fourth package that they claimed they 'attempted delivery' of to a place of business that does not close during the hours of 9 - 5:30 (and these deliveries are usually 'attempted' between 11am and 2pm). They claim 'business was closed' or there was nonexistent 'construction' preventing delivery. I am sick of this enough to stop ordering from merchants who use Purolator, causing other businesses to suffer as a result. Many of these packages are things that are required to be delivered THAT DAY, and these 'missed deliveries' are a major inconvenience for not only personal deliveries, but also professional ones (I work for a lawyer who routinely receives late packages from Purolator, usually containing certified funds needed right away.) These drivers who don't even attempt to deliver packages should be ashamed of themselves. Now I have to take a bus for over an hour to retrieve a package that was never even attempted to be delivered. I have contacted customer service about this, was given a bland platitude, and told it would be looked into. I never heard back. Horrible, horrible service."
Worst courior ! I disliked the way they deal with costumers!Although we were at home Postman never ringed the bell and  just put a notice that we missed you come to our address which was so far from my home to pick up the envelops !My sugggestion : do not use this service at all! to prevent wasting your time and energy!When I went to their address the lady did not care and never apologized nor explained why this happened! additionally she nagged about ID requirments and asked more than one photo ID and address proof!
"Worst customer service I ever had to deal with, they don't make any effort to accommodate their clients. Unless you own a car, the pick up office is at the worst location, OC Transpo doesn't even go there. I had to reschedule delivery twice (and take time off work to be at home) because they would ""forget"" to pack my package in the truck in the morning. I haven't received my package yet and it has been almost a week now. They aren't even capable of telling you an approximate time of delivery (afternoon or morning). I'm very disappointed in the service they offer and would recommend to all, individuals and companies, to use another method of parcel delivery."
"The driver left a slip saying they attempted delivery, but I was home all day so obviously they didn't try very hard. The pickup location would take a round trip of over 2 hours to reach by transit. What kind of a courier company doesn't have a pickup location downtown? When I pay for delivery, I want the package delivered to my house, not some hellhole in the middle of nowhere. From now on when I do online shopping, if they ship it Purolator I'm just going to cancel my order. I encourage others to do the same. Maybe online retailers will get the message and use other, more reliable shipping methods."
"I ordered something on Amazon, leaving clear instructions that our building buzzer does NOT work, and to call us with a cell phone so we can go down and let the driver in. I just got off the phone with your customer service rep, explaining this to her, but still I got nowhere! We have no vehicle! If I would have known it was Purolator I would not have ordered. You guys can't even make this special exception for your customers. Fedex does this for us...You guys are VERY bad service and I will never recommend you to anyone."
Fido sent me a new device via Purolator. The device came to Purolator Depot in Ottawa on Thursday around 4 in the morning. It has been five days and I am still waiting for it to be delivered. They can't ship in the same city in five days. It has also happened in the past when I placed an order on Toys R Us. I am filing complaints with the vendors to use any courier service but Purolator. Pandemic or holiday season are not acceptable excuses when other couriers are doing such a great job. Customer service is nice but they can't do much if the Depot is dealing with a huge backlog. Really disappointed.
"Not even worth any stars. 9/10 packages that are supposed to be delivered through Purolator don't get delivered, nor is a delivery slip left. I can only assume the drivers are too lazy to make the delivery. No other delivery company seems to have a problem delivering orders. If I had a choice in who delivered the products I'm forced to order online, I wouldn't ever give Purolator my business."
"They are holding my package hostage! I've been trying to set up delivery of my item for a month! I received a call that my package would be delivered, received a confirmation number, but no one came. They attempted delivery two days later when I wasn't home. Now they say I have to pick up my item. (I'm not able to.). The call center has contacted the depot several times with no response. I've even had the sender ask them to redeliver!! Not impressed."
"One star is too generous. I felt like I was being pranked when dealing with them. Missed my parcel delivery as I have a job and they came at 1 PM on a week day. My apartment is downtown and I don't have a car so I couldnt just swing by their ridiculous pick up location barely even in the city. I called to have my package kept for a few more days while I sorted something out and the person I spoke with said ""I don't think they'll do that they have a lot of other packages there"", I waited on the line for 20 minutes to get that answer. I then tried to get it delivered to my office but that idea was far too radical. I can't believe they are a company that primarily does shipping and can't figure that out. Now I have to get a ride in a snow storm and spend my lunch waiting in line in an industrial park. They have destroyed the convenience of online shopping. avoid at all costs, the worst"
"Hard to get to if you don't have a car. Better alternatives have neighbourhood pickup sites throughout the city. In my case the only notification that a delivery attempt was made was when I checked the tracking number online - no card or anything was left to indicate the driver had come. I bet they work harder than most, but things like this leave a poor perception of your company in Ottawa."
"Would give 0 if I could. Purolator decided that there was too much construction in my neighborhood to deliver, despite the fact that Canada Post has never had an issue, and my street is still completely accessible. Rather than leave my package at any of the local pickup sights (one of which is literally a block from my house), they had me come pick it up from a site about 12 km away. 30$ in cab rides later and I've just managed to receive what should have been delivered to my house days ago. Never going to be using this incredibly flawed company again, and I would highly recommend you save yourself the headache and avoid them as well."
"They never leave a delivery slip at the door or ring the doorbell even when I'm home. They just mark it as ""delivered"" and leave, while I'm home waiting! This is the 10th time now that this has happened and I've called their office many times to complain about it and still nothing is being done.This is the worse delivery service in Ottawa, and everytime I see them as my courier on Amazon I always feels a sense of anger."
"I ordered a mattress and bed from Amazon on Aug 3rd. I received the bed but no mattress up to now. The delivery date changes unexpectedly and the tracking site is not reliable and not accurate reason is Unable to deliver due to Heavy Duty Item . Mon Aug 10, At the entrance of where i live i see missed delivery notice basically saying they couldn't find me and i should go to the pick up location in Ottawa Hawthorne...VERY UNHAPPY. Amazon is one of the company that uses their service. I can't believe i am still waiting for a mattress. DEFINATELY NOT COOL!!!!"
"Unbelievable that the delivery man never leaves a slip of paper saying an attempted delivery was made. Not even a email or phone call notification saying: ""hey we tried to deliver and you weren't there we have it at X location"" nothing. So naturally after waiting a while I get concerned about my package. after a little research I find my package had been shipped back to the seller because I hadn't picked it up in time. I talk to their customer service rep about the issue and she said ""we couldn't contact you we had no information"". Which is straight up ridiculous because all my details and contact information is on the shoppin label. anyways they deserve this rayon needless to say"
"Awful Experience.I received a call on a Friday saying a package arrived when I was away so it will be dropped at a Purolator location downtown. I was told it is open until 8pm. It was a long weekend and I was unable to get to the address until Wednesday. It was late around 7.50 pm and it was closed. I assumed it was closed early for some reason and returned at around 7pm the next day. It was still closed. At this point I learnt the Home Hardware it was located in closed at 7pm and not 8pm like I was told. I then managed to go back today, 7 days after the call only to be told that the package wasn't there. I called them and gave up after they made me wait around 25 minutes. I tried the online chat on my phone. Wrote up a similar sized paragraph as this about my issue. switched apps to go get my Tracking number, and came back to my browser to find the page refreshed. infuriating. Then switched to my laptop and tried again. Repeated above story and the gist of the response was ""I apologize"" ""It is scheduled to be sent back to the sender because 5 business days have past"" ""I will try to hold it at HQ (located an hour and 20 minutes away) if possible. AKA no guarantees. Terrible customer service."
"They dropped the package at the depot, which is farther than the store the item was ordered from. Why wouldn't you just drop it at the closest depot to the destination? This is not the first time something like this has happened with Purolator. From now on I am calling the retailer before an order, and if they use Purolator, I'll shop somewhere else.In response to Purolator's response to this review, no, I don't want to have to contact Purolator each time to make sure my packages aren't dropped off farther than the store they came from. Other couriers understand this."
"I have decided that before I order online, I will find out if the company uses Purolator. If they do, I will not order from them. On Monday I had a delivery to my apartment. Someone let the delivery person in to the building so I didn't know they were here. Someone knocked on my door, and left right away - I got to my door less than a minute after the knocking and I could see no one through the eye hole. So I thought, ""That was strange."" and went back to work. I happened to go somewhere later and lo and behold my delivery was sitting there outside my door. First, if you knock on a customer's door, wait more than 10 seconds for them to come to the door. Second, it is my choice if my deliveries are left unattended, and I don't want them to be left unattended. I was so mad at this that I will be going out of my way to avoid their services."
"It was ok. First of all they said they came to my house and didn't so the package ended up there. I know it's not this particular location's fault. However this location has a call from your car and pick up option but they don't answer. Going inside was fine, not a big deal. But just a comment that they have the option but it doesn't work."
"Dropped off a package without ringing the doorbell that was already noted as refused. Came to return it received poor service when trying to return. 6 people in line and one worker continues to talk on Bluetooth about a corworker going for chemo. Very unprofessional. When other customers asked what to do when the package says it’s here but they can’t find it, workers response was “I don’t know.” How helpful, not!"
"Insanely inept at their jobs, the drivers can't find my home no matter what address i give them. They continue to tell me it's a Canada Post problem yet, they (nor UPS) have no issues finding my home whatsoever. When we talk on the phone, nothing ever gets resolved. When i go to the warehouse, it's dirty, the employees are rude and don't seem to care one bit. They all seem 1 bad look away from tearing me a new one. I have vowed never to use Purolator again."
Terrible business! No accountability. No return policy. No policy to prevent drivers from falisying delivery informarion. Pervers abuse of a monopolized industry especially with the canada post strike currently. Terrible customer service. Brutal time management skills...not just for a shipping and delivery company. No use of gps. Tracking notifications are inconsistly appropriate. Estimated delivery dates are a complete farce. If i had a choice i would NEVER order anything from them...but there is NO OTHER SERICE RIGHT NOW. Isnt there a competition bureau of the governemnt for preventing monopolies? Im beyong frustrated with numberous delivery problems and no steps taken towards preventing the reoccurance of the same mistakes. I have filed complaints that seem to do nothing towards having my package delivered or refunding my purchase for their inability to follow through with their end of things. Been waiting to speak to a person on the phone for over an hour now!!! Same bad music on repeat too. Worse part is...this review wont affect their business at all because they make more money off corperations than individuals.... they dont care about you and i.
"I ordered an item though Amazon to be delivered to my new apartment. Having just moved in I didn't have a buzz code set up. I missed the first delivery attempt and called to schedule a second delivery on a day that I knew I would be home the entire day to accept the parcel. I called their customer service line and dealt with a very kind and helpful gentleman that informed me that the drivers don't have business phones but they could make an exception and call me to let me know they were here. The following day I received a voicemail from a woman that told me that their drivers were PROHIBITED from calling people. I called back and explained again, this time to a very rude gentleman, that I don't have a buzzcode yet and I don't have car to pick it up from the depot. He just kept repeating that it's not their policy and eventually hung up on me. Luckily, my property manager was able to come through for me and set up my buzzcode in time but I still think it is ridiculous that Purolator was so resistant to doing their basic job which is delivering packages. I didn't choose to go with Purolator for this delivery as I ordered through Amazon but I have to tell you every single time I've ordered through UPS or even Canada Post I have never once had to fight with them that hard to do their basic job and DELIVER THE PACKAGE!"
"They did NOT EVEN bothered to ring us from the intercom OR leave when/what time to pick up our parcel. We ordered an item from Amazon Prime. Had our names and everything on Amazon Prime account and on the order info. We stayed home ALL day Saturday just waiting for this package with our phones on us so we can buzz them into the building when they ring us from the intercom. No call recieved at all. Then at 5pm, we checked the shipping info online, apparently they ""attempted"" to deliver it to us at 3:48pm. Key word ""attempt"". Does attempt mean showing up to the building entrance, not bothering to ""attempt"" to contact us by searching names on the intercom and just leaving a note saying purolator mised you. Did I mention they also left the ""your packages will be ready for pickup empty""? We live in centretown, we dont have a car. Now we have to bus all the way out to Hunt Club Rd. At some unknown date to pick our parcel up. Worse than Canada Post. At least they do their jobs.They also did not email or give us notice in any way shape or form of the time frame to expect our package. Hence waiting all day at home on a Saturday, just for this disappointment."
"I actually don’t even want to give them 1 star. Paid extra for shipping to wait a week to actually get it. I had to wait an hour to actually speak to someone over the phone. Was also told by someone to leave a note on my door telling the delivery driver to bring it back to hawthorn road since she said she was gonna call me when she saw my package, never got a phone call but noticed that my package was getting sent back to the sender."
"I had order something on Amazon it was supposed to be delivered on July 11. It never arrived due to the truck broke down. Then we had called to adviced not to send it for delivery will come and pick it up. It was put on the truck for delivery it was supposed to arrive on July 13. Due to the driver was not able to acces the door it was not delivered. We called to advise what happen and told them will come and pick it up today due to we need what we had order for this weekend. Was told a request will be send to have it taken out the truck due to no one will be available on the next delivery day. Today we spend a few hours at purolator waiting for the package, kept being told the truck was not arrived. Then we advise it show that it was there, we were told that it was put another truck for delivery for Monday, We told them it will be the same situation and no one will be there. Now an email will be send to the manager to have them hold it. We didn't really appreciate to waste our time waiting at home for it and then at your location to wait again and not getting our partial. We had to take time off to wait for my order."
"i ordered TV stand online and the delivery guy told me to come get it out of the truck myself. I told him i have back injury, i can't bend or lift heavy items. He old me thats not his problem.i called to customer service to complain but nothing was done about it. This was the most horrific experience ever. 2nd time i ordered, the delivery guy left my package outside the condo. I returned home from work and saw a package unattended, so i decided to have a look and surprisingly, it was addressed to me. I mean,  Anyone would have taken it."
I came 5 minutes before closing time and received excellent customer service. Was my first time using Purolator services. The employee helped me tape my package closed and also said he would try really hard to get it on the next shipment. THAT'S WONDERFUL!!!! The same employee also asked me if I still had the email containing my tracking number and mentioned that I would be able to track my package online using this number. I had a very pleasant experience using Purolator services and I felt like I left my package in very good hands. I would definitely recommend them to anyone!
"Ordered a package on amazon.  Unfortunately they used Purolator as the shipping company.  Never had a worst experience, not only was my package delayed for 2 days after the guaranteed delivery date, but they claim it was delivered today at 1 pm, when there were 4 people home and none of them heard or saw anybody come to the door of my house.  I called them and they are currently trying to track the packages whereabouts.  This is ridiculous , awful, painful service.  Surprised they are still in business."
"It is insane to me that they don't have local drop off spots for packages. I was at home, heard a knock on my neighbour's door, and a second later they left, slamming the outside door behind them. I received a package from Canada Post later the same day and found the slip from Purolator for my package on the floor in between me and my neighbour's doors (the driver didn't even peel off the backing to stick it to the door). I look up the barely legible location they haphazardly stamped on the slip and it's literally an hour and a half away by bus. If I ever have a choice in the matter I will not be choosing this company to ship with. Even when you qualify for free shipping for an order someone is paying these people to basically just not deliver anything."
"Put my package on the wrong truck, when I found out about it via tracking, I called to have it held at the front desk for pick up,  I didnt mind traveling two hours round trip to pick up my package as I really needed it for the weekend, other than yes it was two hours out of my life due to their incompetence, but whats worse was that when i got there the driver ignored the message from the lady at the call centre, whom i spoke to and she gave direct instruction to the driver to leave it for me, had left it on his truck and was sorted back in the redelivery trailer for monday!! My weekend plans ruined, and 2 hours of my friday wasted due to purolator consistantly dropping the ball. Im going to be contacting amazon about this miserable delivery service and request my packages in the future go through another parcel company if at all possible and i personally will never deal with this company willingly again in the future."
"My address is located two blocks away from their location Hawthorne Rd. (5 min. walk) however, when they want to deliver to me driver delivers after 5pm where when I called them they confirmed to me on two incidents that parcel is out on delivery since 8am. how is this logical?!I rather pick up, its one day faster!!!"
"Edited to change fifth to seventh: Stop leaving packages on the ground by the house!  This is the SEVENTH delivery in just over a month where you have left packages on the ground by the garage, right where water pools and extremely desirable for thieves!  No knock, no doorbell, just drop and run.  We have a front door with a screen door to safely drop packages (Purolator NEVER uses it but all other delivery companies do).  I've called, complained, emailed and complained with no resolve.  Unlike FedEx or UPS, they can not flag addresses NOT to drop on the ground.  Extremely disappointing--please avoid Purolator for all things shipping."
"Service was horrible. Delivery was delayed, delivery person did not ring the buzzer so I wasn't even aware anyone had come by. And no notice was left at the door . the only way I learned they had supposedly attempted a delivery was by tracking it online. When I called the main office, not only did I wait half an hour on hold, but all I was given was an excuse that they do not like to leave the delivery notice at the door in apartments for security purposes. However, I have seen many Purolator delivery notices left at at the front door  before. What was supposed to be here in 1-2 business days, has now taken 7 business days."
"The absolute worst mailing service; everytime this carrier is used they always screw up the delivery claiming that no one was home (even though I was home), that the package was refused in spite of the driver never actually delivering a thing, or they deliver to the wrong address. Not once was my experience with Purolator been a good one. Do not recommend; I'd give it a 0 star if I could."
"Shipment from Montreal to Ottawa promised delivery by Best Buy for Nov 3. 2020 and it is now Nov 18 with no delivery. Called company every day and now I cannot even get a call back. Shipment has gone from Montreal to Ottawa twice for some reason. Both times it has shown dropped off to agent in Ottawa west. At the very least if Purolator is not able to handle a shipment of 37 kilos then they should refuse pickup and let a professional company pick up. Advice to Best Buy, with Christmas around rhe corner you had better find a better carrier to handle any items requiring delivery or you will be losing customers and you will be inundated with customer inquiries."
"Sending a package from the Purolator depot is quick and easy. The attendant that I dealt with was friendly, efficient, and helpful.There is an overnight box for priority letters. However, if it is important that you have proof that you sent the package on time then it is better to attend during business hours to obtain a shipping receipt.It is easy to find and there is plenty of customer parking."
"No one writes nice online reviews about their shippers/couriers, but Purolator somehow manages to plumb new depths.I requested to have a package held at this depot so I could rent a car to go pick it up (on the edge of town, ugh) - I was assured it would be there, but of course it wasn't.  Purolator had given my package to a subcontractor, who had apparently not received the message.The depot staff were unapologetic and unhelpful, but said they would call me once it was there.  They did...just before the depot closed...and not before I had to return my rental car.All the while, there was zero useful information on the tracking website about which depot the packages would be at, whether more delivery attempts would be made, etc.I called customer support 4 times, rented a car, and drove to the edge of town and back...and still don't have a package.  Never again.  Use any other shipper instead."
"Avoid this company at all costs, use Canada Post or UPS but never Purolator.  Every time they deliver, the driver just leaves the package in front of the building door.  I take the day off and wait but they never buzz, and the area I live in is not the best, so the packages get stolen.  This delivery I request that a signature is required upon delivery, again I wait but they never buzz my door, and then I’m surprised to see a note on my building door.  Very frustrating, now I have to rent a car to go pick up my package.  Serenity Now!"
"Just Terrible!First time they came for delivery, they didn't even buzz my number. They didn't left any notice either. After tracking the package on their website and calling their phone number, I rescheduled another appointment for delivery. I stayed at home on the day (off my work) but no delivery again. This time the courier man made a buzz but when I went down the building (I live in an apartment on the 8th floor), nobody was there! The irresponsible agent neither came up for delivery, nor waited for a couple of minutes at lobby."
"I suppose to give negative stars, but unfortunately I couldn't. Their drivers always lie, I do have all correct address, still they put a note that ""address need to be corrected"" which is absolutely lie. I called their call center, they checked the address and didn't find any mistake ...... Purolator drivers never came to my home.....I will definitely force all my suppliers to stop purolator."
Terrible service. Don’t even bother calling the customer care service. Made me wait 45 min on the phone just to tell me my package is being delayed. When calling it goes through an automated voice system which disconnects(disconnected on me 5 times). Online chat never has any agents(why have a feature that is never gonna be used). Have better odds getting Trudeau on the phone than getting a representitive of Purolator. By far the worst experience I have ever had with a distribution company. Staff extremely lazy and put zero effort to satisfy customer. If I could I would even give lower than 1 star.
"If I could give a negative score, I would. This has got to be the worst delivery company on the planet. Cannot deliver heavy items during the week, will only deliver on Saturday because they don’t want to put 2 drivers in a vehicle during the week!!!!! I’m still trying to wrap my head around that one because they are a delivery company ( I use that term very loosely). This is not the first time these clowns came up with a good excuse as to why they couldn’t deliver an item. I can tell you that I will never use Purolator again.....complete incompetence......"
"Worst shipping company we have ever dealt with. Our wedding registry was mostly shipped through Canada Post but with the limbo status of the strike Purolator got the call to ship a gift to us.Both times they attempted delivery I was home. We called Purolator 4 times. Twice we got through in under 30 minutes. Twice we waited 45 minutes on hold and hung up. The 2 woman I spoke to on the phone sounded helpful and polite but did not do their jobs properly. We asked twice for our package to be sent from Hawthorne to the downtown location as Hawthorne is a ~60 minute bus ride away  each way. Both times the ladies said yes we will get the driver to do that. Did not happen. We went to the downtown pickup twice and both times they were polite and offered to check if our package was there even though the tracking said it was not but we were assured especially on the second call it would be there. Not there. Today, 14 days after first attempted delivery the workers tell us they shipped it back to sender and give a refund to the gift giver from our registry.We know you're busy with the current status of Canada Post but either your customer service people are lying about making the appropriate notes or your delivery men don't care to read and just ship it back to Hawthorne as that is probably more convenient for them. We live about a 15 minute walk from the downtown pickup and he brings it back there twice and once after we called twice to confirm the downtown pickup location.The tracking also said their was an error and we had to call again and this was after all 4 calls.Will NEVER out of choice give Purolator a single cent and hoping anyone else reading this to NOT put yourself through hours of phone holds and going out of our way in person to ask the current location of it in person. This company deserves 0 business."
"What is the point of paying for an item to be delivered to you when the delivery company doesn't even try to deliver it (I received no call or note, and I'm ALWAYS HOME because of COVID), and then expects you to show up at their warehouse in the middle of nowhere in order to pick it up? I don't have a car. That's why I ordered online. In the future I'll try to avoid Purolator."
"Purolator are willing to continue in bussiness by lying about delivering. They never came to my door. They are overwhelmed and playing with system to push people come to warehouse and pick up instead of delivering.Will report this Amazon. Amazon should stop dealing with you. Purolator, you are payed to deliver.The worst carrier ever. no honestly. The Bad management kills the reputation and bussiness."
"Waited 20 minutes for the woman working to serve 2 customers, take a personal phone call, and then abandon the people waiting in the line to help a former employee ship a package out, even though her job was to retrieve packages waiting. The woman working to ship out packages was busy helping other customers. I watched her ship out 5 packages, including helping the customers set up they own labels on the computers."
"Absolute disguising service.  One star is far too generous.  I followed the directions on the delivery notice after a missed delivery and the parcel was not there when I arrived, despite clear directions that it would be.  When I questioned an associate on the matter another employee listening in actually called me an idiot, then when I asked for her name to report to management the three employees at the desk literally ran and hid in the back room leaving customers stranded right before closing - easily the most unprofessional and bitter employees I have ever come across.  Avoid Purolator at all costs, especially the crew at 3330 Hawthorne."
"Your service is absolutely horrible...You do not meet your delivery deadlines (pur-LATER) and when you can't handle the volume of work, you expect us to still pay for a service that's no more then ""give us your money...you'll get it when u get it"" service.  I've been on hold for 1 hour now, trying to track my package and let me tell you...when you are running a business and your shipment is crucial..not receiving my product in time for me to service my clients is UNACCEPTABLE....I sure hope people ditch you and go for UPS or FedEx...Just cause you've been around for a long time doesn't give you the right to not care about your customer service and not meeting expectations/deadlines...The world depends on the reliability to get their packages....I wouldn't even give you 1 Star...I had to in order to post this."
"Complete clowns!! Every single “delivery” ends up with a sorry we missed you slip!! I’m at home waiting, no knock, ring or call made! Collection point is a 25 minute drive from my house!Pro tip! Call amazon and they will black list Purolator on any future orders!! Win! This has been a constant issue for me and I couldn’t hate this company anymore than I do for failing to provide their basic services of being a package to deliver!!"
"Just like 99% of the population I despise Purolator and try to avoid it at all costs, but unfortunately a relative of mine used them to ship me a gift and paid for direct shipping to my workplace as they cannot seem to wrap their heads around the fact that people live in apartment buildings. Of course the package never got to me (to be expected) and my relative was told I would have to go to the depot to pick up the package instead and to do so I would need a letter on company letter head confirming my employment at that address (complete hassle and completely ridiculous). The worst part of this is that this is not even the worst experience I have had with them.Save yourself the headache and avoid this company as much as humanely possible.-end rant :)"
They s¿ck so much. Too much. Every time I get something to be delivered by them happens the following:First delivery attempt: Driver can't figure out how to dial our apt number (201) in the buzzer   - as if there were letters instead of numbers on the buzzer panel - and leaves immediately.Then I call customer service explain to them the buzzer works (yeah as if it was rockets science).Second delivery attempt: You better be waiting at the door the whole dammed day or the guy will ring and walk away again immediately. Ring two times? Not in this life.Then I have to go to the end of Ottawa to pick up the thing.Delivery company? I doubt it. A pick up company instead.They just don't take customers seriously. They don't care if people misses a work day to wait for them at home.They are in and out shamelessly.
"I've read endless reviews complaining about Purolator. Every single one of them has been from an apartment building. Take note, if you live in an apartment building save yourself the trouble and use the closest pick up location and you will have no issues. Also, if you must have it shipped to you apartment always include your ring number. These drivers are doing 120+ stops in a day, don't expect them to stand your lobby for ten minutes searching for a ring number. Since I started using the pick up location down the street from me I've had no issues. They call me early morning when it comes in and I have 5 days to pick it up. Another thing, always request your traking number from your shipper. Never try to call or pick up with out, your just pissing off the clerk and the people behind you waiting to pick up."
"I paid $ 48.00 to have a very urgent package delivered in Ottawa before 11:30am. They did not even try to deliver it. No delivery van was even close to the building as  my daughter was watching the whole time. They then do not have a phone number that will be picked-up  or customer service that spout anything else than the three lines they learned from the company. They just state that no refund will be given  and  they will not deliver the package... This is the worst possible abuse of customers...you do not provide the service you have been paid for, so you are stealing my money and my time and I have no recourse. They just tell you they are sorry that we feel this way. Useless company , useless customer service and using them leaves a bad taste in my mouth and a feeling off being abused!!"
"EDIT: Recently the service from Purolator has actually improved. Maybe I complained enough and they started to buzz and bring packages up? Either way, I'm happy at the improved service.The absolute worst carrier in the country, no question. Every time I have an issue with Amazon deliveries, 100% it comes from this carrier. From packages being delayed in Toronto (where their main headquarters are) for 2 WEEKs, a city FIVE HOURS away, to being delayed a WEEK in the SAME CITY, to drivers not delivering in apartment buildings when buzzed in, or not even making attempts to deliver AT ALL and lying to Amazon about it. Their absolute dishonesty and sloth is downright shameful."
"Dealing with Purolator is like dealing with a child!!! I have NEVER had so many issues when it comes to a delivery company!!! Very first issue is that Purolator lies! When I called to find out where our (my partner and I) package was they blamed it on the company that we purchased the merchandise from when in fact it was Purolator's fault as when the merchandise arrived the purchase order receipt was inside the box with the date they had shipped merchandise out...... this was the proof that Purolator had in fact lied to cover their own butts!!! We did not complain about that incident, until problems kept happening and escalating. The first time I tried to complain and speak to a manager about an incident, I was placed on hold and left there until i just hung up! My partner complained one time about why it had taken almost 5 days to receive a package that by the way is a regular shipping item we recieve,  but after he complained we found that the customer support or going to Hawthorne Rd location to pick up a parcel that should of been dropped off was treated wrongfully we think because of us complaining in past! It has gotten so bad that we have changed our delivery company to Canada Post! We have had no issues with their service. It may take a little longer but in reality I think we get our package sooner being with Canada Post!!! I would NEVER suggest Purolator to anyone!!! They did not and do not have the professionalism or training for our liking. When we deal with a company like that we don't appreciate being lied to.  Thank you for the opportunity to express our feeling about your company!!! Have a great day and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 😁"
"Purolator has been the most unreliable courier I've ever dealt with. Similar to what other people have said, there is never any notification when a delivery attempt has been made. This most recent time I found out 2 days later that the delivery was unsuccessful as the address was ""incomplete"". No attempt was made to make me aware of the situation and for a very time-sensitive order this is unacceptable. Furthermore, the address that was provided is a business address I've used before that Purolator was able to deliver to. Attempts to call the Purolator number to rectify the situation were unsuccessful...when I made a selection via their automatic phone system, I was promptly disconnected. Three times."
