       "608  worst shipping company we have ever dealt with our wedding registry was mostly shipped through canada post but with the limbo status of the strike purolator got the call to ship a gift to usboth times they attempted delivery i was home we called purolator  times twice we got through in under  minutes twice we waited  minutes on hold and hung up the  woman i spoke to on the phone sounded helpful and polite but did not do their jobs properly we asked twice for our package to be sent from hawthorne to the downtown location as hawthorne is a  minute bus ride away  each way both times the ladies said yes we will get the driver to do that did not happen we went to the downtown pickup twice and both times they were polite and offered to check if our package was there even though the tracking said it was not but we were assured especially on the second call it would be there not there today  days after first attempted delivery the workers tell us they shipped it back to sender and give a refund to the gift giver from our registrywe know youre busy with the current status of canada post but either your customer service people are lying about making the appropriate notes or your delivery men dont care to read and just ship it back to hawthorne as that is probably more convenient for them we live about a  minute walk from the downtown pickup and he brings it back there twice and once after we called twice to confirm the downtown pickup locationthe tracking also said their was an error and we had to call again and this was after all  callswill never out of choice give purolator a single cent and hoping anyone else reading this to not put yourself through hours of phone holds and going out of our way in person to ask the current location of it in person this company deserves  business   \n",

       "      <td>i really wanted to give purolator the benefit of the doubt but ive now had  major issues with delivery with them before during and after the recent canada post strike so i dont think it has anything to do with thati dont have a car and love utilizing amazon prime but every time something is shipped through purolator it either doesnt come or they attempt delivery and then make me bus over an hour to get my package at their hawthorne locationi ordered a large package and left a note on the front door of my complex with my buzz number and also made sure to put in on my shipping address i get a message at pm that night stating they attempted delivery earlier when in reality they didnt even bother to try and bring it into the building and didnt leave it at the door of my apartment like i had asked i made sure to leave a nice message on the entryway door of my apartment complex as i wasnt too sure when the package would arrive i now have to bus over an hour and then walk  minutes to the pick up spot and then pay for an uber xl which will be over  to get this package home because i dont own a vehicle i will also need someone to help me as this package is heavy and dont own a dollyi also have had a package that was supposed to be delivered on november th that has not arrived yet and every day i receive emails from their trackingtracing specialists stating that theyre going to make sure it comes soon its ridiculous this has been almost  weeks and every day the tracking information updates to delivery rescheduled for next day the people have been polite in their emails but unfortunately nothing has come out of itother times they have put down a message that they missed me when in reality i have been home all day and didnt get a knock on the door  they just dont want to bring it up to my apartment i honestly dont even mind coming downstairs to grab it for them as i understand they probably have a lot of deliveries but this would require them to buzz me or call me so that i can come downstairsi can understand if the package is a day or two late as i know cyber monday and black friday plus holiday shopping has caused an influx of orders but the lack of communication and not even attempting to deliver the product is what really bothers mei am going to start cancelling my prime orders if i see they are being shipped by purolator and maybe this will push amazon to start using a different delivery company</td>\n",

       "528  i really wanted to give purolator the benefit of the doubt but ive now had  major issues with delivery with them before during and after the recent canada post strike so i dont think it has anything to do with thati dont have a car and love utilizing amazon prime but every time something is shipped through purolator it either doesnt come or they attempt delivery and then make me bus over an hour to get my package at their hawthorne locationi ordered a large package and left a note on the front door of my complex with my buzz number and also made sure to put in on my shipping address i get a message at pm that night stating they attempted delivery earlier when in reality they didnt even bother to try and bring it into the building and didnt leave it at the door of my apartment like i had asked i made sure to leave a nice message on the entryway door of my apartment complex as i wasnt too sure when the package would arrive i now have to bus over an hour and then walk  minutes to the pick up spot and then pay for an uber xl which will be over  to get this package home because i dont own a vehicle i will also need someone to help me as this package is heavy and dont own a dollyi also have had a package that was supposed to be delivered on november th that has not arrived yet and every day i receive emails from their trackingtracing specialists stating that theyre going to make sure it comes soon its ridiculous this has been almost  weeks and every day the tracking information updates to delivery rescheduled for next day the people have been polite in their emails but unfortunately nothing has come out of itother times they have put down a message that they missed me when in reality i have been home all day and didnt get a knock on the door  they just dont want to bring it up to my apartment i honestly dont even mind coming downstairs to grab it for them as i understand they probably have a lot of deliveries but this would require them to buzz me or call me so that i can come downstairsi can understand if the package is a day or two late as i know cyber monday and black friday plus holiday shopping has caused an influx of orders but the lack of communication and not even attempting to deliver the product is what really bothers mei am going to start cancelling my prime orders if i see they are being shipped by purolator and maybe this will push amazon to start using a different delivery company   \n",

       "176  i ordered a piece of furniture online through walmartthis order was picked up by purolator on friday february th  however the product that i ordered just kept on delaying to be delivered to my home i was told that the first time it didnt deliver was because the order didnt arrive in time for purolator to be picked up i was unhappy because i took work off to stay at home and to wait for the order to arrive after i found out that the weight of the parcel was lbs and they have a policy that it needs two staffs to be on the truckunfortunately it seemed like it was extremely difficult for them to get  people on the truck it was very frustrating and caused trouble to get my order deliveredsomeone from the depot contacted me and told me that the only time frame they can deliver the product was on saturday february st  from am to pm i am not available on that day i asked to be transferred to the supervisor to see if there were other options after speaking with the supervisor i was beyond disappointed the customer service at purolator from the depot department was totally unacceptable the supervisor that ive spoken to made me feel unpleasant and the attitude was just rude i was told that i didnt understand their rules policies and that my options are limited due to the weight of my parcel i fully understand the reason why my options were limited my concerns were why is it so difficult to get  people to be on the truck i was also told that the delivering date on the tracking system doesnt mean it will deliver on that day it sounded as if it was my fault that i took work off and to wait for the parcel it was very frustrating dealing with them the supervisor was attacking and addressing that i have no choice to satisfy my need take it or leave it  this particular individual pointed out that walmart is already providing free delivery and free redelivering the item on saturday february st  i recommended paying extra fees to get it delivered express since i wont be available on that day however the supervisor told me it was not an option i was the given the option to\\thire a mover to pick up the order and to deliver it to my home\\tdrive there myself and to pick up my orderit was unbelievable that i was advised to hire a mover as a shipping company they should be ashamed of their business if i need to hire a mover i dont need you the nd option was also very inconvenient for me to travel to kipling since i dont own a vehiclethe supervisor at the depot rudely said to me since you dont mind paying extra money you can hire a mover to come here and pick it up and deliver it to your home people have done that before the tone of voice that was used was unfriendly and i was offended at that point i really dont mind paying extra money to get it delivered it was just very frustrating as i was waiting for my orderluckily i got somoene to deal with this issue i was told that my parcel was not even considered to be overweight it was  boxes and each of them was less than  lbs the parcel was finally delivered on friday february th  and there was actually an option to get it delivered on another day however i had to go through a lot of troublei will not order online through walmart again because i do not trust purolator shipping my orders it was not a pleasant experience if this is an ongoing issue then most of the walmart customers who ordered heavier items will most likely go through the same thing as me   \n",

       "525        Purolator should close down. It’s an absolute disgrace to call this a “delivery” company when 90% of the time you have to drive to their warehouse.\\nThey don’t knock at your door but will claim they stopped, they won’t update the tracking, they delay packages ONLY because they driver is too lazy to pick up a box that is heavier than 10LBS.\\nShame on Canada Post for keeping this waste of a company alive   \n",

       "      <td>i went into the sydney depot purolator yesterday i was in a complete fret as my daughter was back in ottawa and needed these  articles of clothing by friday at purolator i met  amazing employees june and shelly from their friendly greeting to their helpful suggestions on the best way to send these articles i felt like i was in the company of friends to say they were beyond helpful kind and professional would certainly be an understatement the computer was really slow  and would not accept payment they tried several attempts and were so apologetic it didnt seem like lost time because we were chatting this is the kind of service companies strive for where the customers leaves feeling welcomed  valued and treated like a friend i would like to suggest that these two ladies get some kind of recognition valued employees like these two ladies should be made an example of  they deserve it and have earned it i can only imagine how amazing life would be if every person in these positions had just a bit of their kindness and helpfulness  i look forward to using purolator again and will sing purolators praises for such amazing service many thanks frances allan</td>\n",
