"We have tried multiple times to straighten out our addresses to no avail... multiple calls. Left on hold for over 40mins to speak to anyone In charge to fix our situation which is messed up on their end... we are so completely frazzled at out end and UPS could give a rats butt that we are unhappy and disappointed with their service. AMAZON PRIME should you a different carrier...
UPS drivers are lazy and incompetent.... UPS is an inferior service company that doesn't hire qualified drivers to deliver the packages we pay to have delivered..
Rotten service
Then they leave you on hold for hours to talk to someone...
Lousy customer service....what do they think I'm going to hang up???
Nope"
I have been having my chemo meds delivered through UPS by my online pharmacy for a year now. UPS only delivers in window increments which would be fine if they showed up within that window. I have had to take full days off work to be here to sign for my cancer meds while they reschedule at the last minute for a completely different day and delivery time so I end up missing DAYS of work. Often times they show up either before or after the arranged time and then just leave a note of attempted delivery. I have yet to have ONE delivery go through without a hitch. Worst company EVER! I would NEVER use this company to deliver a birthday card let alone mandatory life saving meds. I'm finding another pharmacy that doesn't use UPS. They are THAT bad and based on their one star average here I'm guessing I'm not the only unhappy ex-customer.
"I signed up for UPS MyChoice almost 6 years ago. I have it noted that when a package requires a signature, please drop of at an access point in Festus, MO. For some reason they refuse to look at this information and drop all packages at an access point that is only open 2pm-530pm Monday-Friday. How does that help when someone has to work? That is the reason why I signed up with MyChoice and have everything going to the UPS store in Festus. I can't tell you the number of times that I have complained to the local location about it. What are we suppose to do? It is getting to the point where I will not shop with anyone that ships UPS."
"not even a star but is 0000000000 totally 0 service , this is the most embarrassing shipping company. you seat and leave your job waiting for this stupid company coming and in the end they don’t even come and they have the courage to write that they haven’t found you . this is crazyyyyyyyyyy totally unacceptable"
"Horrible Customer Service.
The drivers don't deliver don't ring the bell and then claim they missed you. UPS then charges extra for you to reschedule pickup at a different location. Disaster for deliveries."
"You need a human answering your phones. It is awful not being able to talk to an actual person, it’s awful and nothing gets answered if you have questions. It’s absolutely horrible"
"UPS has my package that was supposed to be delivered 6/8/2023 and up until now UPS keeps lying, delivery attempt made. Sender asked to hold the package. I call the sender and they have no idea what UPS is talking about. UPS is the worst delivery company. Do not use them."
"Too bad we can't leave something less than 1 star. UPS delivers most packages on time. The operation is good, however the back office is horrible. First of all, no one in the back office is American. All accounting services are foreign. In my experience, we learned that UPS overcharged. When this fact was brought to their attention, I was advised to talk to billing. Billing transferred me to Receivables. They okayed refund, however decision to how refund happens goes to Adjustments. Adjustments may or may not reimburse, however for Adjustments to do anything, we will first need to call back again in a month or two. Reason is because ""Adjustments"" needs my authorization for $25.22 refund. I asked to give it now, and was told no. You wonder why UPS is rated 1 star. Bottom line no one in charge. I asked for senior management, and was told by Receivables that there isn't anyone in that position. Kind of makes sense. UPS agent suggested we write off UPS overcharge because nothing else will happen. No accountability at UPS."
"I purchased 2 pairs of pants from the Brax company which did not fit so I returned via UPS using the enclosed labels for free returns. These returns were shipped to Germany, which surprised me. A few weeks later I received a bill of over $300 from UPS because they say they don't have Brax's shipper #.
UPS said they created an account just to bill me--I guess they looked up my info because I certainly didn't provide it to them.

I did not agree to pay for the shipping-Brax did. All I did was drop off the pants using the enclosed label provided by Brax. I have called UPS twice and been that I should find Brax's shipper number so UPS can bill Brax--that sounds like being asked to find the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West--how in the world would I get that information? Brax is a big company and surely UPS could contact them, but instead they made up an account for me."
"UPS is a complete joke, delayed by a week with sporadic updates at the end of the day which report that it will not be arriving today but tomorrow"
"I've been in contact with UPS and the shipper numerous times. Have been given conflicting information.
Would give this company NO stars if I could.
Terrible business model."
"I will never order from a company that ships using UPS again. This is the only way I can figure out how to safeguard myself from such horrible delivery service. I joined a wine club and my first shipment was shipped using UPS. The first delivery attempt they left a sticker saying I wasn't home and they will try the next day (I was home because I work from home every day). Next day I literally watched the truck drive off. By the time I got downstairs to catch the driver it was just a sticker saying I wasn't home. Driver didn't knock, call, yell out or anything. 2nd time, I bought 2 book cases from Ashley Furniture Saturday and salesman said delivery date is June 14th. Bookcases were delivered Monday, June 12th and were left on the side walk, no call, no knock, nothing. UPS just left the boxes unsecured on the sidewalk. UPS is the worst company I've ever dealt with. Just close your doors because your not offering a service, your making lives difficult. You will not get my support again and if my only option is UPS for delivery then I won't be buying at the company. I like Ashley Furniture and my winery but because you use UPS I have to take my business elsewhere."
"I have never seen worse service than this,
Less coordinated, Zero Cooperative.
We have booked one courier 2 months back from Denmark but still they are unable to deliver.
If any superior authority want to discuss please welcome...
Only talking like bla bla bla ....
Condemn......"
"Worst company in history ….they are pathetic, customer service is pathetic, everything is pathetic. I’ve lost literally days trying to solve a problem, no success at all.
Never using them again."
"So here where I am with the rubbish service from UPS so far. Sent away my sons Xbox x worth £500 new and under warranty to microsoft facility in Frankfurt via UPS.
I work away from home but checked just the other day to see how the repair or to get estimate of when it will be sent back, Only to find out its never been delivered by UPS soooo they have obvs lost it.
I then started a claim on this to then be informed via there website that as the claim is raised 3 weeks after posting it it is now out of date and can not be claimed against. any responce UPS ?"
"What a laughable joke joke when you are blind, calling in to customer service line and cannot speak to a real human..
So being blind I cannot read a tracking number, hmm imagine that. If I wasn't blind I would have no reason to call for help...
This is my husband typing this complaint"
"Ups driver helped me load my treadmill box.
This morning around 10am I was at the mailroom of my apartment(1145 Republican St, Seattle, WA 98109), loading the box for my treadmill to the moving cart, UPS driver Muhammad(not sure it is the write spelling) came to drop off the packages. He saw me was struggling, helped me to load my treadmill box to the cart and hold the door for me to get out of the mailroom.
I appreciate it so much for his help. Without him, I definitely would not be able to make it.
Thank you Muhammad, Thank you, UPS!"
"Constant disappointment with UPS, packages never arrive on time, Being delayed by days. Communication is terrible and delaying with the complaints department is a headache. Maybe cheaper then DHL but it’s worth paying extra for a better serve. DHL from now on"
"They said they tried to deliver but can't because of customs. No problem, paid it that same night and still no delivery the next day. Called them twice and they have no idea if the package was being delivered or at warehouse. I needed the package and they don't let you pick up, they can't track where it actually is. So delivery next business day is a complete lie. Plus they make you make an account and put a credit card ON FILE otherwise you can't even pay the customs. Absolutely worst services ever. I'm going avoid using UPS going forward and avoid vendors that use them. LITERALLY any other service provider is better."
"UPS has ZERO customer service. They lose your package, and then when you try to contact someone, you get an imbecilic bot that doesn't give a crap about your package or you as a human being. It's literally impossible to talk with a human being, and if the bot doesn't comprehend your tracking number, you're screwed. It's mind boggling to me why anyone would voluntarily use UPS. The Postal Service does a far better job, as does"

"Incredibly unresponsive customer service!
They couldn't care less about their customers..."
"UPS shipped a package from Italy, due in 2 days. The promise delivery day was Thursday and I was informed it was out for delivery. At the end of the day I got a notice that it would be delivered the next day. Friday the delivery was cancelled by UPS without explanation. I called the customer service to ask if I could collect the box myself as I needed it for the weekend. They said not possible for the same day. They don't works Saturday and Sunday. Monday no news. If I tack the package it just says delayed. I call the operator and have to call 3 times before getting a proper line. The operator says there is no news, it is just so busy because they don't have enough collaborators. I ask to get the package myself from the depot, she says not possible. I ask when will it be delivered, she says no idea. I ask when will I be updated, she says I don't know. This is the worst shipping service possible! Avoid it as much as you can!"
Driver refuses to drop off package on a consistent basis
"I am suffering from 11 days of procrastination and manipulation of the local UPS in my country and obstructing my delivery of the shipment from the date of June 1, my shipment No. 1ZY735V20491886163"
"ups doesn’t deserve a 1 star review, there should be a zero star review. Complete garbage. Just trash trash trash"
The men working at the store on Richmond Ave were so efficient! With it being a Saturday I thought I would spend a good chunk of time there. Although the line was long it went very quickly. I was in and out with 2 returns in less than 5 minutes! Kudos to the crew!
If I could give them ZERO stars I would. Absolutely the WORST shipping company. Drivers lie all the time about “ATTEMPTING” to deliver a package and NEVER even made a real attempt. UPS is a f****** joke and ruined my wedding day. My package was set to be delivered a day before (which I know is pushing it) after I paid extra for express shipping and the driver lied about attempting to delivery. Called the customer service number and was promised it would be re-delivered the following day. That turned out to be a lie AGAIN and was just given more of a run around when I called back. UPS need to do better and hire HONEST drivers who WANT to do the job they are PAID to do. Absolutely DISGUSTED!!
"Worst service ever, ridiculous. Booked next day delivery from CH to UK, of course never happened. They said there was no commercial invoice, of course there were, otherwise they wouldn’t have even accepted the package. Once we sorted that out, after multiple calls and multiple email comms, needless to say that the customer service is something ungodly… they confirmed the invoices were there hahahah additionally I struggle to have them collecting the package, you know why? They said “the drop off location is closed during lunch….” Me: so what!? You won’t collect? Then don’t put it as available droop off location no!? Anyway the package arrived in UK, 4 days ago, every day showing delivery for the same day, of course they don’t deliver and the day after they change the date again, I won’t call again hopefully it’ll finally be delivered but this company is a joke they are jokers please don’t waste your time with them. One of the only person who replied to my email said “unfortunately since the company outsourced the resources to -other countries- this happened” UPS you’re a joke"
"Good service and care for a safety delivery, They accept the options to do delivery in CVS and keep me informed about the status by email."
"I had a package delivered and my bf was home all day waiting for the package so it didn’t sit out.
First off my package which was an Apple Watch got stolen from UPs . I tried to file a claim they shut down my claim and wouldn’t let me proceed with it. Calling them is a joke and can’t get through to anyone. What a effing joke."
"Claimed they attempted delivery when no notice was left and absolutely no one ever came to the door at the claimed time of attempted delivery. Now I have to wait an entire weekend for them to deliver it to an access point for pickup, and no way to manage delivery without the infonotice number on a notice that was never left because no delivery was attempted. The company commits fraud by trying to shift the blame onto the receiver for their own incompetence and attempts to save money. I already vowed to never use UPS ever again before, and unfortunately there are still companies that use this FRAUDULENT company to ship so I still have to deal with them."
I was expecting a package that needed to be signed for. It was already a day late with me having to stay home for it for 2 full days. The delivery time for today changed 3 times throughout the day. My apartment lobby has a coded door so I left the driver a note to call me if it was locked. The driver left a failed delivery notice right next to my note. This is the worst delivery service in the country.
"Absolutely horrible. I get the feeling that the majority of their staff is new, because many of them just make up things when they do not know how to help you. Package show (on its way) on their site, Speaking to a rep, tells me its not.CAll back 5 mins later, oooh, now it's in the truck, but it's not. From now on i am making a concerted effort not to buy from companies who ship exxclusively thru UPS.
Its extremely disconcerting that i was given a cost of $2400 to ship a an electric bike from canada to the UK. The cost exceed the cost of the bike. The rep said that he could slash the price by 2/3 if i were to open an account with them. IF you make it clear to me that you were full well prepared to charge me three times the cost, i won't trust you much at 1/3 of the price, and i will never ever open an account with UPS."
"Wouldn't even give a star, but have to...ups sucks big balls...throw my package on porch and slammed into my window. Luckily he didn't break the glass....very rude..ups sucks the worst"
"By far the worst courier.
Almost every time they deliver I have problems.
1) their policy of not delivering to the neighbours but instead they are coming the day after, at the same time (what makes them think that if I am not at home during a working day, I will be the next one?) and then they deliver to a pick-up point. that takes extra days.
2) And happened to me that a pick-up point on the website was different that the other one.
3) lately, after 2 attempts, I asked them to keep it at their distribution centre for me to pick it up. Took a confirmation mail, and went there but the package was not. None knew where it was...
4) I have called customer service many times for the same package and every time I am listening to a different story...

By for the worst among the courier."
UPS DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY WE END UP BEING ABSOLUTE C*NTS TO YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM? Cuz you make me repeat my tracking number 3209487 times before it will let me be transferred to a representative. Then when I finally think I'm about to talk to a god damn human (which if I would of started with a human and not a dumb a*s robot I would be fuming at the ears) I get transferred one more time to a robot that tells me to go to the website ... which the website wont fix my issue which is why I'm calling and then I get a person and they tell me they cant do anything but read to me what the website does. WILL NEVER BE USING YOU and I will purposely go out of my way to request any packages I receive from 3rd party companies go through USPS Fedex or screw it .... DHL at this point. Horrid customer service.
"Prompt and most efficient delivery, excellent service!"
"I sent a package to my son. After two weeks, UPS failed to deliver it.
I know this because I was tracking the package online. So, I called UPS customer service.
I spoke to UPS customer service, and they claimed that the address was wrong and had no information or detailed notes from the driver.
I confirmed the address they have matched the address we've sent things to before (which my son received without issue).
They refused to attempt delivery again or re-route it to a nearby UPS store and sent it back to me instead.
When I called to request a refund, the supervisor I spoke to refused to refund my shipping charges. Now they are saying that the driver talked to the apartment complex manager onsite. That person rejected the package because they said no one by that name lived there.

The problem with that story is that this apartment building lacks an office or manager on site.

Just a bald-faced lie.

Wait, there's more... This supervisor chose, instead, to blame me for an error on the shipping label. Despite having my contact info, they said they don't contact anyone to correct mistakes or reroute deliveries. The problem with that story is that they've done so for my packages several times and left a sticker on my door to let me know, so why not for this one?
UPS has set a new low in customer... ummm... service."
Garbage customer service. Will blatantly lie right too you. Told me my package was due for delivery at a specific time the next day when even there tracker was saying 2 more days. Guess what. Didn't show. This is after 2 delays and the tracker saying it's in my neighborhood in canada then 2 hours later back in the states. How is this company still running. So many better options out there then this trash
"Sent two new laptops, one lost in transit, one stuck in customs, but try getting through to an agent in the UK on the phone, Twitter crew utterly hopeless, so resorted to emailing the MD Nick Fletcher and one of his colleagues Scott Davis."
"I will never use UPS again!! Long story short…My son graduates tonight, waited how many years to see this!! My overnight order of contact lens was supposed to be her Monday, they made it to the Middletown, Pa hub which is about 10 miles from my house and they screw up and sent my contact lens to New York about 100 miles away. Customer service doesn’t give a crap, they were supposed to call me back because they were going to make sure I got my contacts by today. Guess what they never called and it took me 25 to get to customer service for them to tell me they’re still sitting on a truck in New York!! So yeah I have to go to my sons graduation in a cracked pair of glasses because the power on my one eye need yo be order because it’s so bad!! But customer service did tell me to have a good day."
"i have absolutely had it at this point. i've called five times, confirmed a pickup and nobody has come any of the five CONFIRMED pickup times. asked to speak with management as i work for a company and these packages are transactional... was told i couldn't speak with management. you guys do not even deserve one star."
"COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. I thought I was using a trusted name. Should have checked these reviews.
I left my phone in an airBNB rental in Paris. I am based in London.
The owner kindly took it to their office so it could be collected. Booked overnight service from Paris to London. Parcel not picked up on time; had to call 3 times to get it collected 4 hours late and speak to about ten different people. Very inconvenient for the airbnb owner and stressful for me.
Got am email to say parcel held at customs because ""information missing"" which I'd put into UPS website AT BOOKING.
Got sent email in French - not very helpful for a booking by UK customer going to London but I could translate. Ridiculous form asking value of item (it’s an ancient iPhone from 8 years ago, no idea) and where it was manufactured (seriously?)
No parcel arrives next day.
Call UPS who say
a)call the sender (that was ME - clearly a distraction tactic as it would have achieved nothing) and then
b)there is NOTHING they can do because it's in France and it's ""somewhere where nobody can be spoken to"". When I say “so it’s in a black hole and you don’t know where it is and can’t guarantee it will make it out” - answer yes. Literally do not care at all.
Emailed the customs address, in French, to ask where it is, no reply. Emailed again, no reply.
Get two emails saying it will be delivered on a certain day and time. I have to be there for signature. Doesn’t turn up.
Eventually it arrives a week later after I paid for an overnight service. NEVER NEVER USE THEM."
"Just had a very poor experience: UPS Australian postal database must be a least 4 years out of date as they have no reference to what has been our suburb's name and Aust Post Post Code for the last 4 years. As they couldn't match the suburb or Post Code, UPS decided to delete the correct information and substitute Melb VIC 3000 when they handed off to StarTrack who took a week to decide they couldn't deliver and returned it to UPS. Eventually got UPS to undo their address change but had to settle for the Post Code our suburb had 4 years ago and then UPS blamed my correction of their mistake for all the delays!"
I was charged $9.99 to reschedule my delivery date to Wednesday 6/7/2023. I got an email stating it would arrive between 10:45 AM - 1:45 PM. After the delivery window time had passed I checked the tracker on their website and now it stated that it would arrive by 7 PM. I waited all day and still nothing arrived. No update was given to the tracker until it was past 10 PM and now it just says that a delivery date will provided as soon as possible. My package has been in their facility since 6/2/2023 at 2:37 AM according to their own tracker so I am confused as to why they were not able to deliver it today. UPS needs to work better at updating their trackers and keeping up with their scheduling. Why charge for a delivery date and not keep it. If UPS didn't have such terrible customer service I would demand a refund for charging me and not delivering.
"The tracking communication was absolutely dreadful. First told delivery was due on 1st, then two emails on same day saying delivery moved to 5th. When I tried for tracking updates, they didn’t come through. On checking the status online, the information was contradictory. On the expected delivery date,the status was listed as ‘On its way’, and stayed that way in spite of delivery not coming at all. On the following day, status listed as ‘Being processed at local depot’, right up until the item was delivered without any notice. My attempts to sign up for updates were repeatedly met with error messages. I would definitely not recommend UPS"
"I asked to hold a package if I was not there when they arrived. They decided to not even deliver but just put it on hold. I rushed back home to be here and got nothing. The automated customer (non) service system was useless and did not let me speak with a person.

This is why Amazon is going to eat their lunch. I do so many more packages with Amazon and never have problems. A couple of times a year the merchant uses UPS and I get screwed."
"Absolutely the worst customer support, always some issue with deliveries. They don't even come to the property but their statement is that they couldn't find anyone at the address. Even when I tell them that the property have 11 surveillance cameras they don't stop with their lies. I will strongly urge all of my suppliers to avoid them if they wish to continue working with me. Never again will I order anything that have UPS as a delivery company."
"UPS was supposed to deliver a package from China that I have been tracking for a week. First it went to Kentucky and took forever to get to Fort Worth. Then the delivery person noted the address was inaccurate and took it back to Fort Worth. Mind you they have been delivering to my address for over 14 years. I believe when the delivery person got here, they realized the package was not on the truck. I think they lost my package. I have called twice, and have been lied to twice. Both times they verified my address, assured me it was being worked on and that I could expect a call within a couple of hours. No call either time. I am more than a little irritated. They lie to their customers and waste their customer’s valuable time. I have another package that just shipped from China via FedEx and it is already scheduled to deliver Friday. FedEx and USPS can find my address just fine, so what’s up with UPS? I’m waiting to see if they change it to out for delivery today, but not holding my breath!"
I thank God don’t have to deal every time with UPS this time I had to don’t know where Package ended up but finally ended up at my doorstep I was so mad!!
Ups website sucks. I can’t change delivery. Can’t contact an agent. Can’t sign in. Wasted hours on this. I will avoid ups from now on.
Same problem. They lost my package and instead of admitting it they keep false delivery attempts which has never happened. I'm so tired and frustrated about this cituation and huge company that trying to cover up their lost and waste your time and nerves. Never use them again!! Hopefully they will go out of business!
Worst customer service EVER. You can't get a live person on the phone and you can't get any information on packages that you aren't expecting which supposedly require a signature. You can't get anyone through chat either. I've NEVER seen such a poor customer experience in my entire life. Even worse when the package is super valuable and it's super stressful because you can't track the driver and you miss him by 3 minutes. When I actually did get someone on the phone he was rude and then didn't call me back as he said he would. Too bad Jeff Bezos can't buy UPS and fix it.
I ordered a google pixel phone ...long story short it ended at ups ...they lost the phone at 10 days and now my second order after getting google to refund me shows its being delivered but late....will see if i actually get my phone from these guys....
UPS store in Garland TX. One of the employees completely lost his sXXt when I asked him about the symbol on the return email for an item from Amazon. Chewing out a customer is not my idea of customer service. Not even sure I completed a sentence when I was 'talking' to him. Wow.
"Their Surepost delivery, where they start with the package and then hand off to USPS…they have some pretty significant problems with delivering to PO Boxes. I don’t know how many of my packages have been delayed because they seem to struggle with the hand off. This last one they completely lost and I had to wait a month to get a refund from the retailer I purchased the item from. Done with UPS."
Too bad we can't give them 0 stars . I imported a £157 package and I paid £10 shipping upfront and when we received it UPS gave me an additional £80 bill(£35 import charges) + UPS charges £45
"Absolutely rude couriers! The courier yesterday even didn't say hello. Then I asked if I should sign any document to confirm that I received the parcel - the courier didn't bother himself even to listen to my question, he just left while I was asking this like I was an empty space or smth. This is unbelievable! Such a disrespectful attitude towards customers!"
"If I write it on trustpilot directly it’s because you make it too hard to contact the customer service.

For parcel 1ZWW26156800480083, the delivery wasn’t even attempted. I was at home, but the driver thought that it was better and easier to just send it to the collection point, wasting my own time. Shall I bill UPS for my hourly rate?"
"So, I received a notification today that a package was delivered by UPS ""at the front door"" at 6.03 pm. Well, I was home at the time; no one brought anything to the door. I left my house at 6.05 pm, and my front door camera has footage of me leaving. What it does NOT have, is footage of anyone delivering anything to my front door just 2 minutes earlier. When I called UPS, the robot said I have to file a claim online, and no representative can help me file a claim. So, I went online, and filed my claim, and guess what? The other robot tells me it cannot process my claim and I must CALL UPS. UPS is a sh** show. They don't care, they send you on wild goose chases, while they steal your stuff. I am going to tell everyone I buy from NOT to use UPS, unless they want to lose a lot of money."
I ordered from a company that uses UPS. I kept getting tracking info kept telling me me my package was to be delivered 6/2. I had live small animal hay. I finally called UPS and informed me the order is lost. I was not notified and do not have funds to buy it. 6 rabbits and two Guinea pigs who will be very hungry tonight.
"Keeps saying package was attempted to deliver and no one ever showed up to my door.

This is a $500 package that I have to bere for since I live in an apartment and anyone can take it so I signed up for the delivery in which a signature is required.

Waited two whole days from 8-7 and nothing. Then kept getting a message that said 'attempted to deliver will try again' but come to find out after the third attempt they will resend it back.

Even though I was home and have a camera to prove NO ONE showed up at my door and I called customer service only to be told they can't hold it at a facility for me to pick up and they refused to take any responsibility for the fact whatever driver was supposed to deliver lied.

This isn't the first time this has happened and it's utter bs. Just tell me one of your workers stole it/delivered it to the wrong place so I can get my money back cause I know I won't get my time back."
"ups just sucks from late packages to lost, I am still trying to understand how they decide who to deliver packages to first, Just now i was looking at the follow my delivery the tuck showed he was in front of my apt after 20 mins i check again and he or she is now 30 on the other side makes no f sense and ups my choice is trah i pay so i can get my packages at an 2 hour window but it never works"
Somehow I wait all day and no matter what my address is they take all cotton picking day to deliver and waste my time .. I hate UPS
Yea them and FedEx don't open apartment building doors n leave packages we never have issues with USPS. It don't even require signature and they still can't open the dam door n leave it they don't need to get all the way in bldg. Amazon. Lately been using ups and after today I'm closing that account USPS n FedEx are
"Failed to deliver my parcel for the second time, original delivery date was 2 June 2023 sent me a text at 21:00 informing me that they won’t be delivering and they have reprogrammed delivery for 5 June 2023, I had to take a second day off work as my signature was required for parcel, i waited in all day but parcel was not delivered, had another text at 22:00 saying parcel would not be arriving."
"Package was delayed in transit was supposed to be here on Friday, told me it would be delivered on Monday. I live 15 minutes from there distribution center, it has been 6 1/2 hours since it went out for delivery. Don't you think if the package was late to begin with it should be the first one delivered on the next business day? Wouldn't mind except the contents are heat sensitive, we are in Florida and I spoke to customer service on Friday to let them know."
"I had hoped that leaving a one-star review would have an impact, but with the overwhelming majority of one-star reviews at 92%, it seems unlikely that my feedback will make any difference. As a business owner who relies on UPS regularly, I am currently facing an issue where a time-sensitive package was returned to the sender. Unfortunately, I am unable to file a claim at the moment because the package is still in the process of being returned. Whenever I try to contact UPS, their automated answering machine instructs me to file a claim, but when I attempt to speak to a live operator by pressing zero, the system informs me that it is unable to connect me to a real person. It is incredibly frustrating to see such incompetence from a company that has consolidated earnings of over 27 billion in 2021 alone. This situation serves as a clear example of the negative consequences that arise when a company becomes too large"
"I've contacted 3 UPS Customer Service Representatives and 1 manager to resolve a delivery issue. I recently moved to a newly constructed house and have had a 911 / GPS address since November 2022. UPS has not delivered any of my packages for the last 3 weeks or contacted me to inform me of any issues. I called them 4 times over the previous 2 weeks and was told that they were updated their system with my new information. Meanwhile they had 2 packages that I needed and was assured on June 2 that my packages would be delivered. Both packages were returned to sender and I wasn't notified at all. 1 package cost $350 minus shipping and the other package had my medicine, since I'm a quadriplegic. I cannot drive or have any way to go to the UPS Jackson MS office which is an hour away. I now see that UPS has another package on hold that is about to be returned to the sender."
"This is the 3rd time I've had to use UPS to send something and the second time the package sent was lost. Not a great track record. When I tried to enter a claim, the automated system couldn't find the tracking number. It took many calls to actually speak to someone and ""file a claim"" which hasn't ever worked. Basically the package is lost. This time it was the title of my car that was supposed to go to my insurance company! Now I have to apply for a new title just so my insurance company can total the vehicle out after it was stolen and damaged. What a hassle!! UPS is the worst!"
"Ups sucks

They should all quit and go back to their mothers, they have no customer service experience no social skills nothing. They also don’t know how to deliver a package."
"This is the second time that UPS has failed to deliver in the last 3 weeks! I ordered a $98 cake from Gold Belly. The cake was for a birthday party on Sunday. The delivery should have taken place on Thursday, but was moved to Friday. I then received a text that it would arrive between 6:15 and 8:15 PM on Friday evening. Then out of the blue was texted that it would arrive on Monday between 10:15 and 2:15 PM. Which totally missed the delivery date for the Sunday birthday party! I called UPS to see if I could pick up the cake from one of their fulfillment centers on Saturday. Only to be told that they don't open on Saturday or Sunday...even after an email offered for me to pick up the cake. What is going on at UPS????"
"After they finally agreed to give me a refund they said it takes 20 days?!?!

35 days have passed and I’m chasing them. They say sorry it takes 20-45 days.

They just lie to your face. Please don’t use UPS."
"One star is being generous. For the second time in about a month I’ve been lied to and inconvenienced regarding two quite expensive deliveries.
Both times I was told delivery was attempted-it was not, at any time and after speaking to three different agents and sending more than one email I finally picked up my item about a week after the first delivery “attempt”. The second delivery was meant for this morning. Then it was changed to this afternoon-early evening time. A few moment ago I received an alert to say I had missed a delivery attempt. I don’t see how as I’ve been up since 7am and as far as I’m aware my hearing is intact. I have an intercom and door bell. Clue is you’ve got to ring them to gain access. Nobody has “attempted” any delivery. I understand delays happen, I’m quite understanding like that but do not lie and don’t try to fool me. I’m told I’ll receive a phone call sometime today from the distribution warehouse regarding this problem. We shall see but one thing is sure I will never use UPS again. Absolutely outrageous behaviour to customers from a company which sole purpose is to deliver parcels. Something is very wrong when you’re well known like UPS but clearly not well liked."
If you see that it’s the shipping company that any website offers do not buy it. Took 5 months to send back my product. The miscommunications inside the company is absurd. Each counter gives you a different answer
The worst company ever they semd email that my package is gona arrive Wednesday i cahnge by day off to wait the delivery when i was waiting they send again email and they said is gona delivered next day evening i swap my shift uswell o wait amd they didn't came i call them and say the the package is on the depot i ask to speak with someone mangarer or supervisor in charge nobody unswr
Dropped a package at ups access point “cvs store” properly wrapped . It was a phone . When it was delivered it was just the box there was no phone inside the box . They did a very bad business and their policy is if something go wrong claim for it . This ain’t a right way of doing it . Not trusting ups anymore .
I have tried for an hour to ask for a tracked delivery to go to a neighbour as I will not be. it is impossible. Round and round in circles this must be the worst site ever. I have given up.
I will gladly pay extra if it means I never have to use ups again
Terrible service. Changes of delivery and not reliable information.
"Yes, I shudder every time I have to receive something from UPS.. all across the USA it is the same story.. sloppy drivers, crooked dealings, utter lack of support. Something as simple as changing a delivery address, or changing your My Choice profile.. Nothing works. How they stay in business is already a criminal situation."
"I ordered a package which was delivered by UPS. I received online updates throughout the process.
However, the most impressive part was returning the item which was bulky.
I called UPS at 2.40pm and was told they could collect the item from my house within 2 hours. 20 minutes later the package was collected.
I was then able to track my return by tapping on a photo of the return label.
Brilliant service."
"Package never reached access location as instructed. Driver on more than one attempt went to the wrong address to drop the package off and customer service was of no help - the customer service rep gave conflicting and wrong information regarding package delivery. NO ONE FOLLOWED THE DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN.This was an important package needed to complete a job. I prefer Fedex or my own feet over UPS - at this point... the worst experience ever!!! I was even told I should have paid for another shipping option and since I use the cheap one (ground) the package will take time to arrive.. I paid for overnight shipping!!!!!!!! SO, I GUESS IF YOU GO WITH THE GROUND OPTION UPS reserve the right to lose your package and delivery the package when it's convenient for them! At this point if the package is being shipped by UPS I don't want it!"
Trying to get a package shipped they have the wrong address the address correction form only what you put in 8 characters rather than the full address so you cannot. Get the address changed correctly. You can't even change the person's name but it's supposed to be going to. This is a terrible company terrible shipping do not use this company please if you want to save yourself from getting a headache.
"I ordered a tv stand from Best Buy and it was shipped UPS.I waited for it all day long at home.I got a text saying the item was refused by me and sent back to the sender.I was home and no attempt was made and I didn't refuse it.UPS is impossible to call or contact.Best Buy however was easily reached,appoligized and are sending a replacement."
"you can pay extra to get yout package to be delivered by 11 am but that does not mean it will be. You have to call them and remind them but they still mess up. Customer service on a call is done by a call center in philippines and they don't even know what is a courrier service and how UPS works, never sent or received a UPS package."
"New to Shipping Abroad

My study abroad student left retainers at home.

First, the UPS Store employees did not tell us about customs duties and taxes and being tied to the value.

I valued them at $300, and paid $200 to Ship them.

When they arrived, there was a COD charge of $107.

Basically, the retainers are either worth thousands(as the cost to keep thousands of dollars worth of orthodontic work in tact,) hundreds (to replace the physical retainers,) or $0 (As my student's teeth move, and no one else could use them.)

When we contacted UPS in both countries, I we were given the run around by a number of employees phone/email (one, Actually, sending me back to the UPS store, as ""They could revise the invoice."") No, they could not. I wasted countless hours and finally just paid it.

I am extremely disappointed in UPS. I had always chosen them over FedEx.

-If I could go back, it would be $0."
"If I could give negative stars, such would be appropriate for UPS. They subcontracted to a ""UPS team"" which they have no control over and no way of contacting other than providing a phone number and an email. Yet somehow are themselves are unable to contact? You're left on your own to try and sort it out. After a week of many back & forth, handing off to someone else, I have still not been able to receive my package. Will update this if I ever get my package..."
"I wished that I could give UPS a zero! The driver dropped my package off at the wrong house, and now they want the shipper to reimburse me for their mistake! This is so unprofessional. UPS you need to have your driver go to the house and get my package or UPS needs to reimburse my money today."
"To say that I am extremely dissatisfied with the way UPS conducts their business would be an understatement. I had a rather expensive purchase from an online retailer. Long story short UPS has lost my package, refused to give me an answer, and after 3 phone calls and supposedly starting an investigation ticket, not a single answer. Never use UpS even if you have to walk your package to its destination."
"Would have left no starts if they had let me. My daughter bought something online and UPS were in charge of delivery. They said they tried once, complete lie-there is always someone at home and it's normally me. Anyway, phoned and rescheduled, they said an email would be sent to confirm this-it never arrived. Phoned again, exactly the same thing. Phoned again and this time rhey tell me that the packet will be delivered to mine on the 25th of May. We waited, did they ring your doorbell because they definitely didn't ring mine. Then I phoned and received an email saying that it is at a paper shop and I should puck it up. I use crutches and find it very difficult to get around, I explained this to them the first day I phoned. Anyway I went to pick up the parcel and while I was chatting to the owner of the shop, he said that 7 out of 10 people are at home but UPS don't even bother delivering the parcels, they leave them directly at the pick up points.
11th to the 27th of May, that's the time it took for UPS to get their act together."
"I have had three expensive items stolen by UPS over the last couple of years. I know they stole them because they claimed to have delivered them at times when I was in my flat all day waiting for them, and eagerly looking out of my window every couple of minutes all throughout those days expecting to see their delivery vans to no avail.

They claimed to have successfully delivered one of those packages, which was to a completely different city from the one I live in, and they consistently gave the incorrect weights for those packages.

With another one of those items they claimed that two delivery attempts were made, and so the delivery was aborted.

With the other package I saw and heard neither hide nor hair of a UPS delivery van all day when the item was supposed to be delivered, and I heard absolutely nothing from them at all

Their delivery updates are useless because they don't tell you what item your delivery consists of and there was no way for me to track those packages.

I avoid buying from anyone who uses UPS as a courier. In fact I beg companies that I buy items from not to use UPS as a courier, and I suggest that everyone does exactly the same thing."
"I tried tracking a UPS parcel that was sent to me, but to do so I was forced to create a UPS account. This was a nightmare in its self and after several attempts and sign-in error messages it finally let me in.

Incidently, the sign-in error gave an error code and suggested that were I to contact customer service and quote the code they would be able to help. I tried, the customer service Chat turned out to be a BOT and the BOT said that it couldn't help and there seemed no way of bypassing the BOT.

Once I did sign in (I think I ended up using the email address rather than the account ID) when I then went to track the delivery it then wanted to verify my address by sending me a pin through the post.

I finally gave up when the PIN arrived after a few days later (and a few days after the delivery I was expecting had arrived). When I went to complete the process, I signed in, entered the PIN and it told me that the PIN was invalid.

Enough is enough, I am not going to waste anymore time trying to sign up to a company that can't even get the basics right."
"Looks like UPS doesn't check background before hiring. I shipped a nearly 3000 USD gold bracelet via UPS two years ago. The package lost tracking after arriving at the UPS warehouse, it's obviously stolen by a staff who works there. I filed a claim but no response so far The second time was, my client sent me back a piece of jewelry for fixing. I received a notice on the door telling me to go to nearby CVS to pick it up. However, CVS told me my package wasn't sent to them. obviously, the UPS carrier took it. A couple of days ago, I purchase some snacks and medical supplements ( cost over 100 USD) from Japan, and they shipped my package via UPS. And today I saw a notice on the door before it said that nobody was at home so my package was sent to CVS again. I went there but my package is not there, I don't think all these things happened to coincide. I've never lost a package with other carriers. I will never ship with UPS and will tell all companies and people who going to send me stuff don't ship with UPS."
"Why don´t you DELIVER
P I E C E S O F S H I T?????!!!!!!!!"
"Within the 5 days shipping time the package I sent out was damage, opened, re-taped and the MAIN item which was a 1 pound colorful bag(very noticeable) went missing out of the package do not use ups for anything this company does nothing but mess everything up."
"MY PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.I LIVE IN MICHIGAN,AND IT WAS DROPPED OFF IN OHIO.I CALLED UPS,AND ALL THEY WOULD DO WAS PASS THE BUCK.THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.I WON'T BUY ONLINE,IF THE SHIPPING COMPANY IS UPS.TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.I'M OUT $260.71."
"I was waiting for a gift from my employer for 40 years of service. It was a watch. Delivery notice said it was left at my front door on May 25, 2023. It was not there nor anywhere in my yard. Filed claim the next day giving it time to show up. After several days was told it was left with neighbor across the street. Had to wait a week because they were away. They do not have my package. UPS basically said my claim is closed and I have to speak with my employer to get this resolved and get another watch. Total BS"
"Amazon used them to deliver 2 dozen roses to my sister. They didn't follow basic delivery instructions. Instead of delivery to to the front desk of the stroke rehab, they gave the package to some passer-by. They got the guy's name, but staff said no one by that name worked there. I spent hours on the phone with staff and Amazon trying to get my money back or locate the flowers. UPS hung up on me, staff manning their Twitter account flat out refused to be helpful, and those manning the customer service email were flat out rude. My husband's bank, the biggest in the nation, just went with FedEx instead, because he told them how UPS staff behaved in this matter. Actions (or in this case inaction and passing the buck) have consequences. I'd definitely fire some staff who obviously don't take their jobs very seriously and have cost you business UPS! Shame on you all!"
"Worst delivery experience. I rated 1 because there is no way to put in zero. Please somebody, never ever use ups surepost for anything. If there no other shipping method available, better wait until a better one is available. I have been buying things online and having them shipped, this has been my worst experience thus far. Please, don’t even think of using this service. Left to me, this service should be discontinued"
We were out today when ups tried to deliver a parcel. They left a note saying we were to collect the parcel at a town six miles away. They didn't try to leave it with a neighbour. Always had problems with this company. Avoid them if you can.
"This company is really poor with their communication about the delivery of its packages from Nigeria,their website is useless and trying to contact customer support is extremely frustrating because in the end you put the phone down.delivery was due 30/05/2023 from Nigeria and still no more updates.Me personally would rather use a different service as ups customer support is not worth talking about or using because they are expensive to"
"A package that they claim to have delivered was not delivered and it is impossible to speak to a live person. I am beginning to think they are stealing the packages, as this is not the first missing package I've had from UPS. They accept no accountability for their lack of reliable services and missing customer merchandise. They operate with impunity. A ring of thieves? Quite possibly."
"Don't use UPS to ship anything — if you care at all about the items you're shipping. They completely mualated a package of mine carrying a number or items for my new apartment - it even had a huge hole ripped in it. They completely destroyed one larger item in there and dinges and dented multiple others. I sent phptos of the destroyed box and damaged items to them and went through a ridiculously tedious and useless process to be told that since I didn't take photos of the inside of the box, while it was packed - ""there was nothing they could do."" I had to unpack everything to SEE the damage!!!!
I spoke with multiple people, including management, and each time they said they would follow up after speaking to inspections and nothing. After weeks of this, nothing was ever done. They are a total joke and don't care at all about their customers."
I paid 113.00 for them to ship Insulin to my diabetic sister in MI overnight. It arrived in 4 days. She almost died. UPS just plain sux! Worst experience!
I missed three days of work because of UPS is not delivering the package to my door like I asked life multiple notes they horrible customer they should close their business cuz there is a horrible horrible company and they can't help with anything and I recommend that nobody use it okay I'll send
"Had expensive delivery that was scheduled when we were not at home. This review is my opinion of the company customer service system. In my opinion UPS phone system must be one of the worst in the world. Spent a long time trying to speak to someone to get help as I could not figure out how to reschedule three tracking numbers when only two packages were supposed to be in the shipment. After great difficulty finally succeeded in speaking to someone very hard to understand, very rushed and not particularly nice and got delivery date moved. Even got confirmation of change emails. Now two days later I received exception notifications that state packages were rescheduled back to the previous date that is unacceptable. Tried multiple times to get to speak to someone to help but no success. Got really angry and sad to say I was so mad I cursed at the automated system. I just gave up, called the company I purchased from and told them they needed to sort it out. I will never use UPS again and will avoid purchases if they are to be shipped UPS in the future. They really have a customer service problem."
"With two recent deliveries I was told my package would be delivered between 9 & 11. In both cases they came after 5 pm
Today (30/5/2023) I waited all day. Their first message advised package would be delivered between 9 & 11. In the afternoon this was corrected to the end of the day. I have just seen (7 pm) the package will be delivered in two days time."
"UPS is an absolute nightmare to deal with. It is virtually impossible to get them on the phone and once you do they lie about delivery dates and package statuses. Their app is also a joke and has updates which are blatant lies.
I am very disappointed and just pray my package eventually arrives."
"Poor website
Poor delivery
Poor communication
Extremely unreliable
Now I have to attend an business event without banners/material, it was shipped a week ago from Germany..
What a mess"
"An express delivery that was supposed to arrive in 3 days from USA to Sweden is still on it's way now, after 8 days. By some incredible turn of events, the package, which actually arrived in Sweden 2 days from when the order was placed, was directed to London, UK and seems to be still stuck there. I have no words for the level of incompetence someone at UPS Sweden must have displayed. This is one of the worst delivery experiences I've had and UPS is nowhere near the reliable and fast service provider they like to market themselves as."
"Avoid UPS at all costs

I've received an email saying that my package should arrive in 3 days, with buttons to track my delivery or reschedule. Neither works unless I have created my own UPS account, with my password and personal information, even though that's specifically against the GDPR being an EU resident. I should not have to register to track a package that I ordered from another company. Once registered, I click on ""track my delivery"" > the page displays ""technical errors. please retry later"". I click on ""Change Delievery"", another technical error ""page not found"".
I eventually manage to find my delivery from the tracking number, and when I try to reschedule... ""Become a UPS My Choice® member today to take control of your deliveries.""... I sign up to UPS My Choice : they tell me I can't reschedule unless a delivery attempt has already been made.
How is it possible when you main business is delivery to have such a crappy experience it must be deliberate"
"Delivery driver failed a delivery without even attempting to attend property was a parcel from Hugo boss really baffling a high end brand uses such a poorly reviewed company with a team who fail deliveries for fun, very happy to talk to you, my advice change your supplier"
"Useless ... Simply useless ! There concept of customer service is nothing but excuses ! On day five (5 days past the quoted delivery date) still waiting to find my package !

UPS WILL NEVER EVER GET MY BUSINESS AGAIN !!!"
"Avoid at all cost. If your package is accidentally sent via them you can use EU Directive 2011/83 after 30 days of non-delivery. Otherwise if you shopped online you can make use of a 'cooling off period' within 14 days to get a full refund without questions (if you expect UPS failing again). Then reorder the package with a comment to the company not to send it with UPS.

"Really bad.
I booked an express shipping to deliver a package within 24 hours. The driver never collected it from the drop off point and the package arrived super late.
I have been calling over and over for a refund and they keep gaslighting me."
"WORTS logistic company. Not even worth for 1 star. They will always send your item to a pick up point, even if you specify in your order that you want to send it in your home address.

Happened 3 times already with me."
"SHORT STORY:
THEY FAILED TO DELIVER TO ME 3 TIMES IN A ROW AND THEY CLAIMED ""I WAS NOT HOME"" WHICH IS A BIG LIE. THEIR DRIVERS NEVER CALL YOU. APP IS NOT SENDING ANY UPDATES/EMAILS WHEN THEY FAIL TO DELIVER.

FIRST AND LAST TIME I EVER USE THIS DISGUSTING COURIER!!! DON'T EVER USE THEM! ANY OTHER COURIER IS WAY BETTER!

I would rate this company 0 stars, but unfortunately this is not possible. This company is the worst on any plan. Nothing works well with them. They couldn't deliver my package first day. They said I was not home but I was home, the driver did not call me, he did not ring the bell, nothing, he just updated the status to ""Failed to deliver"" and I did not get any notification for that, I had to check the web app myself. Next day exactly the same story like the first day, then I call the customer service and I get one person which can barely communicate in English (took my 10 minutes to tell them my tracking number). After 10 minutes a person which speaks proper English calls me because I couldn't understand anything. He said they will deliver the next day and I said that I did nothing wrong and I want it today because I can not stay one more day home. Then he said it is not possible and we agreed to have my package delivered to my work place next day. The third day I am looking in the app in the morning to not have any other surprises again and of course another surprise is there. The status is noted as ""Address Information Required"", but they have the address confirmed already on the app (you can see it in the image). Moreover I can not do any action from the app to update the address or anything like that (there are no buttons to take any action and the app says it will send the package back to sender if nothing is provided). I am trying to change the delivery address from the correct one to the same address, then their online form fails with no error shown (luckily I am a web developer and I checked that the issue is that they could not verify a perfectly valid address because they have their address system down). That means on top of terrible delivery drivers, they also have an app which is impossible to use. Then I call the customer service again. Luckily this time I got a person I could communicate with in English and she assured me that the package will be delivered. After an hour another guy called me and he said that they could not deliver the package because there are multiple companies in the building and they couldn't find me. Again nobody called me, I got no updates and I had to look myself in the web app. Anyway, I tell him the name of the company and he says he can only deliver the package again in 4 days (weekend + national holiday Friday -> Tuesday) because their system takes 24h for any change they make and they cannot call the driver directly. I tell him I am going to vacation on Monday and there is no reason for me to receive the package after that as it messing up all my plans. He says he can not do anything and wishes me a good day. After this I decided to go by myself and try to get the package Friday evening. Luckily I was able to get it, even though I was told it is not possible to be collected until Tuesday.

They are not even trying to fix their mistakes! They follow their terrible protocol blindly and leave all their customers unsatisfied. Their online web system is not offering any kind of flexibility for the user to do changes for their deliveries and any kind of change has to be done by phone and takes 24 hours to be updated which will end up for your delivery to be postponed for the next working day. And the next working day they will just don't care and postpone you again and again until the package goes back to the sender."
"My parcel wash shipped from US to Philippines door-to-door and it never moved from their warehouse. They are asking for money to deliver it they argue something wrong with shipping label but they know my address contact and email??? Thing is, I was the recipient. They never informed the sender to avoid the problem. Customs said they act like syndicate mafia so they get money from sender and recipient and there are countless reports of it. They will send email requesting deposit but no name or contact info on email, just instructions to deposit.. no receipts too they just give bank account."
UPS claimed that they could not deliver to my home despite the fact that I was at home all the time. I do not believe they even tried. Now I have to go to a delivery point.
"On 5/16/2023 around 4:30pm i went to pickup my husband’s package with order details and photo of his drivers license to ups customer center at 10155 Monroe,Dallas,TX,75229.They wanted to FaceTime my husband to ensure his photo matched.After that they made copies of my drivers license which i felt invaded my security and privacy and was NOT necessary.Next morning around 9am i received emails and text messages from my credit monitoring service that someone is trying to open two credit cards in my name.What a coincidence!! I am
now dealing with identity theft and fraud issues which has been extremely draining,frustrating and exhausting experience for me and my family.UPS employees at this warehouse should NOT be allowed to make copies of customers drivers license because personal information isnt stored properly at this warehouse/location and can fall
into the wrong person’s hands.Next day i called ups 800 number and filed a complaint.Customer service said they will have the manager of this warehouse call me but i have never heard back.UPS corporate needs to step in and throughly investigate the manager and the front desk employees at this location because i am certain my drivers license details and personal information was misused by someone at this location.UPS corporate also needs to ensure all copies of my drivers license present at this warehouse/location get shredded as soon as possible."
I had two packages that were supposed to be delivered today. There are no updates on their website.
I paid for next day delivery and had my purchase 3 days later had to go out and purchase the same item in a different place and caused.distress to my autistic daughter will.never pay for delivery again if its ups
"On April 4th my wife contacted the UPS store #1856 in Lexington MA to inquire about the cost of shipping a Villeroy and Boch Basket weave dinner service for 8 and was told approximately $400.00. Her sister took the dinner ware to the store on 4/9 to pack and ship. They charged her over $1100.00 including $70,00 for insurance. Shipment arrived on 4/10 consisting of three boxes with a total weight of 29 pounds. One 7"" saucer was broken so we contacted the store to file a claim per UPS instructions. They required numerous pictures of the item as well as pictures of the shipping label. We were told we would receive a check in 7 to 10 days. Two weeks latter we called again and were told the claim had to be refiled. We have called twice more and do not even get a call back. Contacted UPS customer service to talk to a representative but the robot could not understand the tracking number so disconnected me. UPS customer service is so difficult to navigate that one just gives up. Next time I will use Fed EX."
"Horrible, you will get the package, but rarely on the date promised. And forget about the time frame provided. It changes throughout the day."
If I could give them 0 i would!!!!! I sold an item ( purse) on eBay and i bought the ups shipping label through eBay. I measured everything ( not my first rodeo) and the shipping cost came out $12.70. They didn’t bill me right away but 20 days later I got a notification I have to pay $22.03 for the shipping. I called eBay and asked why? Customer service said that ups weighted 13 pounds for the package. My question how??? A purse how can it weight 13 ponds a 2 pounds purse ????? So yeah I will never ship with them again. I am fighting to get my money back btw!!!
"Whats up with this company, all they do is charge you a ridiculous amount of money for 2nd day air or 1st day and treat it like a normal package, I paid for 2nd day air and it took a week to get to me, try calling there 800 number and there automated call center is a joke,it can never understand what your saying even when you say it slow and clear, I hate ups but sometimes it's the only option from what site you buy from, this company needs to be held accountable for all the money they scam out of the consumers, I bet there making millions screwing people over.......SCREW UPS......."
UPS did not deliver to my address (residential- specifying a flat number). I started to panic when I received the email confirmation of delivery since my product was not with me and I had no idea where they delivered this to. Turns out they delivered to a commercial premises. The addresses are not similar. UPS failed.
"Our company pays them to come to the location once every day every week for parcel pick ups and drop offs. So far this week they have not arrived a single time, even for the express shipping items which demand same day delivery and we paid EXTRA for. When calling customer service they give you the run around, and are absolutely useless. For the love of god, if you or your company are considering UPS as a partner, DO NOT DO IT."
"From their incompetent drivers to rude managers. I don’t even know where to start. Driver brings a package without ringing the bell or attempting to call me said he missed me. The next day I left a note stating ‘please call me’ with my number.He called and I said wait please somebody is coming (I live in a condo on the 3rd floor) But no he left. I called customer care because they were going to come back the next day and nobody will be home. That will be the final attempt and they will send my package back to the sender. So I said let me pick up instead. the customer care said my sender restricted the changes. That he can escalate to his manager to give me a call and get it all sorted. Okay! Then I get rudest manager in the whole world call me. So I called my sender to change my package to pick up. There are at least 3 UPS pick up centers around me that are open over the weekend. But no! UPS sent my package to the farthest possible and one that does not open on the weekend at that.
This is just one of my many horrific experiences with UPS. UPS needs to more and better."
"liars, liars, lairs, their client service, team and especially managers are the worst customer services people in the entire USA. They can read what you are able to see by yourselves in UPS.com. They are impossible to solve any issues at all..."
"Unreliable, extremely bad for business. UPS must be sued for ALWAYS messing me up with rescheduling my deliveries multiple times. They are only particular about their pay and less concern about quality service. UPS should never be in business. Shame on you UPS"
"They lost over %25 of my packages in last few months, %90 of time , they are late on delivery date
Their customer service, run you around to make you tired
I went to their front desk at airport, they didn’t give me their name, they even admitted that their customer service is useless
They running scam operations, I hope someone from government hold them accountable"
I paid for overnight shipping and I am now getting a delivery update of 4 days later. UPS is straight garbage!
"UPS scheduled a delivery for today, tracker says deliver by 5pm. Then at 5pm it changes to 7pm. Then just before 7pm, delivery is rescheduled to Tuesday. They don't deliver over the weekend. So I have now lost a days pay, and will have to lose another days pay on Tuesday. UPS chat don't care, not my problem, request a refund. Doesn't help me, but the sender gets refunded. No customer service really don't about any service quality. Just avoid them"
"Lying criminals. Paid for expedited shipping. ""Attempted to drop my package off today, but the gate was closed."" Absolutely lying about it. The gate has been wide open 24/7 for the last 6 weeks due to it being broken. I bet they didn't even bother trying to deliver it, just wrote it so they can ship it some other time. Now this package won't come in until Tuesday (3 days from now)."
"Tracking numbers show out for delivery between 2 and 4 pm.
Driver and truck show up driver spends 5 min in the Bach of the truck and than tells me my package is not on the truck. Checks his stilest and says there's something wrong and he don't know where the package is, calls his office and tells me they don't know either.
I call customer service and wait working with that POS computer and when I get a person the tell me it's basically not there problem.
Than I ask for a supervisor get transferred to just another operator who was somewhat more useful and said that he would find where the package is and call me. We will see how this turns out as I told him find the package and if I have to I will drive to get it. As I am being delayed to go on vacation"
"Ups is the worst thing happened to me in the last 5 years.
I'm a chef and I was supposed to receive a new pair of work shoes on a Tuesday. On that day ups sent a notification the parcel was held to delivery change as per request (that I didn't do).
So I called the support the day after and they told me they would deliver on the next day because the parcel wasn't received on their depot on Monday. I didn't understand that motivation but they assured me I was going to receive on the day after, so fair enough.
On the next day I didn't even get a communication imagine the delivery.
So we reach Friday (from Tuesday) the day I came back to work they decided to attempt one delivery. I left a note on the door (please try to get neighbours for delivery).
I received a message we tried to deliver but you weren't in, 2nd attempt.
This time I'm more furious than confused (meanwhile I watched the cctv to acknowledge the driver, he didn't even try to ring the neighbours) so I called the support and they told me they would arrange another delivery on the same day.
After 1 hour the depot called me to tell me that they couldn't deliver because the shop were to drop the parcel was closed and I need to wait Tuesday of the next week.
I just don't believe what I'm hearing and I'm now calling the support to ask for a refund and they told me they cannot process the refund because in order to file a complaint I need to get the delivery first.
So ups it's basically a cancer because they will not accomplished the delivery. If you use their service you will just lose the stuff that you order and you can even complaint about it.
Do never ever ever use ups because it just doesn't work"
"One star is too much,I was supposed to receive a package overnight and it is going to be a week . UPS is a joke ,I would waste my time or money with the uncompetent people"
"Paid express shipping(1-2 business days). Ended up coming at my door 4 business days later with a note. Called customer service, told them that my doorbell is broken and it won't be fixed for another week. Asked them to give me a call to pick it up. Refused, came the next day, another note. Had to drive 40 miles roundtrip and the labels on the package had my mobile number and a note: ""Will call"". Representative was very rude, and arrogant."
"Ignored my request of delivering at a different date, and left the package outside when I was not home"
"I recently had the displeasure of dealing with UPS, and I must say that my experience was extremely disappointing. From start to finish, UPS demonstrated a complete lack of professionalism and competence, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with their services.

First and foremost, the delivery process was a nightmare. I was promised a specific delivery date, but UPS failed to meet their commitment. The package was delayed multiple times, and their tracking system provided vague and inconsistent updates that left me guessing about the whereabouts of my package. It is beyond frustrating to rely on a company to deliver a package on time, only to be let down without any clear explanation or apology.

Furthermore, the customer service provided by UPS was abysmal. I attempted to contact their support multiple times to inquire about the delivery status and voice my concerns, but the wait times were excessive and the representatives seemed disinterested and unhelpful. It felt as though my inquiries were met with indifference, and I was left without any resolution or assurance.

Adding insult to injury, when the package finally arrived, it was damaged. The contents were clearly mishandled during transit, leading to significant damage to the fragile items inside. It is inexcusable for a shipping company to neglect proper handling procedures, especially when the contents of the package are clearly marked as delicate.

Moreover, the overall reliability of UPS is questionable. This was not an isolated incident, as I have heard countless stories from friends and colleagues who have also experienced issues with late deliveries, damaged packages, and unresponsive customer service. It appears that UPS has a consistent track record of failing to meet customer expectations.

In conclusion, my experience with UPS was nothing short of a nightmare. The delayed deliveries, unhelpful customer service, and damaged package have left me with a deep sense of frustration and dissatisfaction. I would strongly advise anyone considering using UPS to think twice and explore alternative shipping options. With their poor performance and lackluster service, UPS has certainly lost my trust and business."
"I am angry. I’ve been waiting all day for a UPS delivery. “Will be delivered by 9 pm”. At 8:45 I check my tracking and see that they tried to deliver at 8:35 but business was closed! THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS, IT IS A HOUSE. I had my porch light on and no one came to the door or even tried to deliver. I have UPS packages left here on my doorstop all the time. They were just being lazy and wanting to get home. Very bad service!"
"UPS does not properly check IDs for people setting up accounts for shipping and billing to the address on the account. I have had two accounts open in my name and address in less then two months. First one we filed a fraud claim with UPS, they said they would shut it down, they have not and I am now receiving late fees. Person opened a second account in my name and address. There is zero tracking information on both of the tracking IDs meaning this has to be an internal person that has stole my name and address creating the accounts. UPS has yet to help with this and calling customer service takes hours to get to a real person! UPS should be properly checking and identifying people before opening a bill to account under someone's name. I will revise my review when these accounts are removed and I no longer have to deal with fraud on my name and address with UPS!"
"We have had nothing but problems with UPS. Currently have an ongoing issue with them. We have called and emailed them several times, we even have a case reference number but still, almost 3 weeks in and we have to constantly chase them as they have zero customer service. Never ever use them to import goods for you from anywhere to the UK as they have no clue about paperwork, C88, CDS, SAD. It deosn't matter how well you do the paperwork because they don't read it. They are really good at generating invalid invoices though...it's all about the money."
Terrible! Can’t talk to a person and y’all weird for that.
UPS has lost or damaged 2 of my deliveries in past 3 weeks. I haven't even been able to view damage because they were never delivered. Driver even lied to me about second one said was on list but couldn't find it then it was reported as damaged on tracking 10 minutes. These both were in envelopes not sure how you could damage these
Needed to drop a important Parcel off too a drop off point. The 10 nearest to me had there collections 2hours before the cut off time.
Delivery on time but only to doorstep. Didn't ring or knock.
"What garbage service provided, paid for an express delivery dropped it off and the next day it states that the package is returned because “The max days to hold the package at the UPS Access Point™ location has expired. The package will be returned.” Called the hotline service number from Austria who told me it’s a miss scan and that the Serbian customer service will write to me, never hear back and i called the Serbian side and was told they don’t have more information. Each time I call I get some other piece of information and was told to call the other number. My package still has not arrived 48 hours later. Never again will I try to send anything via UPS, being rude for a problem on their side and just trying to get rid of my call telling me to call someone else."
"So, UPS already has 92% 1 star, so I am only writing this to vent my frustration. Parcel requiring UK customs fees: I paid these online early morning day ""out for delivery"". Notication changed in afternnon to ""We tried to deliver the package, but were unable to receive payment. A second attempt will be made the next business day"". No attempt to deliver was actually made. Today the status is ""The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible"". Their call centre has told me that delivery will not be made for imports until 24 hours after customs payment and that if you want to pay the driver you have to arrange this in advance. So, their notifications are all lies; UPS did NOT attempt to deliver the package; it will NOT be delivered next working day; you can NOT pay the driver as stated, but required prior arrangement. Still NO guarantee of when it will actually be delivered.
Last UPS import I paid customs fees when requested but he parcel never even cleared customs and was returned to sender, It took 3 months and a LOT of corespondence to eventually get this payment refunded.
Every time a miserable customer experience. Unethical liars. The very worst courier by miles."
No wonder this company has so many bad reviews! I took the morning off work to wait for a parcel that is a birthday gift. Nothing arrived so I attempted to email UPS to ask where it was but it doesn’t let you contact them unless you create an account but when you try to do that it won’t let you! So basically you have absolutely no way of contacting this company. I have lodged my complaint with the company I bought the gift from but fear I will be having to claim my money back shortly. I cannot believe that any company would use UPS when it is clear that they are so bad? Shame on you UPS
Just use another post service. This is way too bad !!! They are not able to deliver a parcel from A to B. Their customer service is 0. They answer emails after 2 days.
"Got a notice that I wasn't available for the delivery, rescheduled the delivery and signed the release slip so they could leave the package and got a notice that it was delivered.... To a pick up location. When I left I saw a separate ""sorry we missed you!"" Slip for a neighbor. Guess that's just their new thing, leave those slips instead of the package itself and don't even bother trying to deliver it again."
"Yet again pretends do deliver when they don’t (we have CCTV). Not at a single package delivered by UPS in the past few months (4 deliveries) without major issues.
I would never order from anyone whom I know uses UPS for delivery. That business needs to stop trading."
Unfortunately there is no 0 star. They do not provide delivery info. The customer service (Hungary) rude and they just lying lying and lying. I have no idea where my parcel (that would be a 50th birthday present is). I am definitely going to sue the UPS.
Please be aware of UPS‘s latest game. An alarming number of Amazon return packages are mysteriously disappearing. UPS will then lie to you and tell you that they have a policy that you need to call Amazon. There is no policy. It was determined that UPS and Amazon tell you to call each other just so that you won’t get your money back. This game is illegal and only designed to flush straight you so you give up. If they do that to you you will win in a small claims court. If the person is above 60 or disabled but its financial exploitation of an elderly or disabled person and you can win a lot of money. Please don’t back down to their schemes.
"UPS went driving down my posted 25mph residential street going at least 40mph. My neighbors cat was sitting on the side of the rd where she sat for the last 5 years and yesterday I was standing outside my house when I watched a UPS truck hit and kill the cat after it looked like the driver saw the cat and didn’t slow down or stop if the driver looked in the rear view mirror he or she would have seen the cat twitching in the rd before it died…. So what if it would have been my 5 year old who just a few days ago learned how to ride a bike without training wheels or her 4 year old friend who lives across the street or her other 2 friends who live next door. Or the older kids who ride their dirt bikes around!!!! It’s simple it’s posted 25mph there are kids and pets in my neighborhood do the dam speed limit, be cautious of your surroundings I mean didn’t you learn this in drivers Ed???? UPS DO BETTER!!! Or get the heck off the rd and let someone else do it right!!!!"
"Three times I have received a package from UPS with missing items where the company indicated that the order was complete. Either there is a thief at UPs who has access to packages and the means to reseal them after they have removed items or the company is not sending complete orders. Each time, the company has confirmed the complete order! This is outrageous. Yesterday a package came that you could tell had been resealed and taped and placed in a manilla envelope and not in the original box that the company sent the items in and the label had been taped to the envelope as well and the items inside were nasty and some of the liquid has leaked out into the envelope. And an item was missing."
"It's like a big puke, S**t!!! In my opinion this ""nothing service"" is only good for make a high Blood pressure for You. Avoid!!! In Hungary UPS is the most destrecptful company, it has 1.8 stars from 5."
"UPS seem to have upped their game and improved the service. A couple of years ago I gave them 2 stars, but the last two deliveries this week have been fine with no problems. Tracking could still be improved to provide a delivery window instead of ""delivered by end of day"" which has people waiting in all day.

Interparcel No: GB5219638183"
"MYUPS.com is worthless. After contacting(and leaving messages due to no live assistance), they've reset my user id twice and yet each time I sign in to ship a package it will not allow. Imagine telling your customers you have to wait for 3 days until you get assistance from UPS so you can process their item. Or, you can take it to the local UPS Store and lose your discounts.... The ""tightest ship in the shipping business"" is mighty loose...."
Yea it's bs that ups takes longer than reg mail servers it's bs because ppl pay extra to get mail quicker and they won't it wil be longer ALSO there lazy instead of them dropping my package at my home there drop it off at my post office...STOP RIPPING UR CUSTOMERS OFF
"Since last night and today until 2pm, the tracking showed that the package would arrive around 7pm, which is great because I will be home from work. I get home at 4pm and what in the world, I get the UPS slip on my door saying they tried to deliver but unable to. I also signed up for text messages - NOTHING. Now I have to readjust my schedule tomorrow just to pick up a package. This is the most basic of services that they can't even get right."
"Watched on my camera as I saw delivery driver throw item onto floor in-front of house, ring the doorbell and then walk of before anyone even answered. What made it even more frustrating a white van was parked outside the house with open doors. They or anyone could have easily taken the package. Common sense isn’t that common I guess."
"A Bunch of Incompetents.
I sent my parcel to a monastery in Greece. It got as far as Athens and they sent it back to the UK, to me because they could not get a response from the telephone number I gave them. It just shows the ""I can't be bothered"" attitud of this company. An absolute lazy bunch who are incapable of showing any regard for there customers. I writen a letter of complaint to the UK head office who did not have the decency to reply.
I strongly agree with many of the views of other disgruntled customers, this lot are a bunch of cowboys with no honor. AVOID!!!"
"I wish 0 stars or even negative stars were available as a review option. This company and its horrible website, app, and customer service deserve a -3 star review."
"Apparently I wasn't available for delivery, however I was home the entire day with my phone on. No Calls, no SMS, no messages with expected timeframe. Suddenly I have to haul my ass to the collection point to pick it up. Absolutely useless and lazy drivers."
"DO NOT use these jokers ! I entered one star, but that's too much. They put a $1000.00 package, belonging to me in a pallet sale because the idiot driver was too lazy to deliver it! They don't care! They get their money from the sender. Pallet sale money is gravy. If you don't want to lose your money, STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS ! You've been warned."
"UPS are thieves. They steal packages. How do you ""lose"" a 6.5 cubic foot box 40 inches long? This keeps happening to us and notice it is happening to others regularly. Never happens with Fedex. Contacting ups is a nightmare, frustrating, many hours wasted. They always need something more. Wish they ran their business like Uline box company."
Absolute toilet company. How do they even stay in business.
"""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery.""

Bruh i made sure to stay home the entire day, phone on full volume, having the UPS tracker open and refresh the page multiple times throughout the day to follow the status.

If i could give 0 i would.

the 'positive' part of this experience is that i end up with a 4.5 km walk."
"I have been waiting for a package to be delivered for 4 weeks now,please avoid at all cost,I’ve been tracking and it’s not just moving,you call them and they keep saying the same thing for about 4 weeks now,AVOID!!!!!!"
"Automated system is totally horrible, but once I got thru to live customer service the agent was great, totally efficient, friendly while being professional, skip the automated system and get a human."
"For 3 days they 'tried' to deliver, came to the electric gate - saw there was a code and drove off. No phone call or anything. Extremely annoying."
"They get 100% of my deliveries wrong. Be it losing the package or forcing me to be home to sign for a package that I PAID them to hold at an access point for me, they always mess it up somehow. I have no idea how they even stay in business."
What the point of scheduling a pick-up at upstairs to pick-up at your house .if they never show up. Then u call customer service an they give you the wrong answer.
"Difficult Claim process that both seller and receiver cant complete with error messages on website,so you will get frustrated and they dont have to payout.
Receiving damaged items like they fell out a 2nd floor is normal for this company. Employees only have to deliver,not care about warning labels nor if it gets mangled or thrown around like a basketball at United Parcel Smashers."
"They aggressively marketed their use our US Address Pickup service across the border in Lewiston NY.
So I order a pair of shoes from the USA on Amazon. It gets delivered.
I try to rent car in Ontario..unable to rent as you require certificate of insurance..have to "" own"" a car to rent one. So I e-mailed them..it says UPS standard on the site for 3 lb. Pkg is $36.33 .They came back with $55.67..have to e-mail C/C number or call them. I do NOT TRUST the people one bit..but in order to save face I guess I,'ll send them $25 USD cash in an envelope and have them mail it back.I s/h known...they would do ANYTHING to get YR. Package there.so I guess I am going to lose $133 CAD and never get my shoes. They were so damb RUDE in their e-mail..I'm tempted to simply ABANDON the package and cut my losses.But I'll mail them $25..even though it says ground is only $14.07:to send it back..you absolutely cannot reason with these people..but that's OK..lesson learned..do not ever use them as they will double prices to rip you off."
"Terrible, terrible delivery company. My item was ""in transit"" at Tamworth on delivery day, a stones throw from where i live. Nothing came, then a message on the tracking page, ""there's been a sortage error"" and that they will reschedule. Not happened yet, several days later. I'm assuming my item's now rattling around getting damaged in one of their wagons while they driving around the country not delivering other peoples items either. Shameful service, should be shut down."
This is the most backward place I have seen. My order was supposed to come for a wedding and the vender and UPS are as dumb as a box of rocks!! I hope they do replace all these workers with AI because at least the AI will attempt to solve the problem not derelict blame
"If i could give them 0 stars, i would. they really dont care about their customers and it shows. every time ive had a delivery from them, there has been nothing but problems. from delivering to the wrong address and refusing to rectify the issue, delivering damaged packages, horrible customer service and now theyre hassling me for ""Accepting"" a damaged item. the driver dropped a package off at my residence and told me that they were aware that the box was damaged. he said he noted it in the delivery notes and told me to contact customer service if there were any issues. i opened the box, saw that items were missing and instantly called amazon. the item i bought (A desk) was purchased while it was on sale. its now double the price. amazon said that if i wanted a replacement, id have to pay the higher price and get the price adjusted AFTER the fact. i dont have hundreds of dollars to be able to do that. so the only other option was a refund.no problem....im ok with that. problem: id need to get it to UPS myself. its a desk. doesnt fit in my car and the box is mangled beyond repair. i called UPS. they wont pick the item up unless its in a box, OR unless amazon opens an investigation. what is there to investigate? im already getting a refund from amazon. so neither amazon, nor UPS will provide me a new box. meaning, i need to provide a huge box, packing tape and other packing materials and spend money to print out a label because i dont have a printer at home yet. we're only talking 10 or so bucks max, but i dont feel as though i should have to pay anything when the damage is not my fault. one of these companies should provide these materials free of cost....why not the shipping company that literally damaged the item in transit? this is beyond idiotic. so now im either out a ton of money, or i eat 10-15 bucks just to recoup the majority of my money. sounds like a no-brainer but at this point, its the principle. how do these companies get away with this? i learned a valuable lesson, though. dont ever accept any items if the box is busted. thats how they get you....hoping that you just eat the lose and move on. then they can lazily avoid doing anything about it or refunding you the money. -1000/5 would not recommend"
"Government need to REMOVE THEIR LICENSE!!
Without doubt the most useless unreliable delivery firm in the UK. 2 Fridays in a row scheduled collections only for them not to turn up, last week it was the Wednesday a full 5 days late? No apologies or even a reason. Plz BOYCOTT this company"
I am extremely upset that UPS just dropped of 2 heavy packages in my open garage instead of at my front door where they were supposed to be delivered. My garage was open for someone else. This package is very heavy and cannot fit through door from my garage to my home. I am livid.
These got to be the worst delivery company u can get why anyone employs them to deliver their packages I don’t know they think nothing of lying to say that they have attempted delivery twice when u got a ring do bell to prove otherwise Blinds to go you are going to lose a lot of customers if you don’t change your delivery company
UPS Luxembourg.. unfortunately the company I bought my shoes from picked UPS to work with.they kept me waiting until the evening and finally they decided not to come but leave the package in another store 10 km away from me.. no notice paper in my mailbox. They literally just didnt want to come. Horrible service
"Updates on delivery were excellent and timely. We received a phone call ahead of delivery, which we appreciated. Delivery was made right to our door and with a smile."
"I had to receive my package, I had to pay for it to be delivered to my address and it is now the second day that they say they are coming and they never arrive, I was waiting for two days with the door open and they never arrived.
very disappointed with this company"
"Horrific. Attempted delivery twice, did not hold the package as they are meant to so I couldn't retrieve it. Rang me to tell me that they have sent it back to the shipper in breach of their own guidelines. You cannot make a complaint, their website doesn't work, they have no complaints department.
They need to be shut down as an organisation - why people use them is beyond me"
"Wretched service. I live on a 5 acre property with instructions to deliver to the garage door. The UPS worker is so lazy that he pulls his truck over on the side of the highway and leaves my packages at the far end of the driveway in an unsecured location, frequently in the rain, just to save himself the time spent driving up the driveway and delivering the package according to the instructions UPS created themselves. I know the customer service supervisor for the local office on a first name basis, and she constantly defends and excuses him. This man has lied repeatedly, stating that the gate was locked when there isn’t even a gate or that there were big dogs when my three small/medium dogs are NEVER outside without me,"
Ups is terrible. Slow service. USPS is better and less expensive.
"Rama and Laurie made sure I was taken care of even though they had just locked the door. Awesome service in the Saint Cloud, Minnesota store."
I hate UPS. I hope this shipping company disappears. I think their work is badly done and it should be banned from all shipping services
"The company apparently can’t get a driver that can read the address. This makes the third package undeliverable because the driver can’t tell the difference between st or pl. I can get all my other packages, but if it’s sent by ups, well that’s another question. This driver is a waste of o2 and probably should just retire. This makes the third package in a one month period."
"Absolutely Effing HORRIBLE!!!! Literally a 30% chance that you won't get your package on time, or at all. And trying to resolve any issue is even more frustrating because nobody seems to be able to do anything about anything! So basically you pay up front for a service that MAY be provided. 70% chance that UPS will hold up their end, and if not I guess they expect you to just forget about it"
"Is anybody missing their packages? They're probably at my house. I've been getting other peoples packages for about 4 months. UPS can't, or won't fix the problem."
"Lakewood Ranch FL location
Shipped two vases out of state. Roy asked the value and if I wanted the insurance. I said yes and told him the value was $200. Paid for shipping and it showed the value on my receipt. Needless to say due to mishandling vases were broken. Called the store and talked to the manager JJ. He looked it up said it would be covered and saw the $200 value. Said if any issues call him and he would get things taken care of. Received only 100.00 for the vases. Called JJ and he no longer was gonna take care of things like he said he would. Made excuses and lied saying Roy doesn’t even remember the conversation or helping me. Then said well Roy said you said you weren’t sure if you wanted the insurance. Well which was it??? Glad this location is ok with losing customers and money. I will advise everyone I know over and over to avoid this place. They have no issues with stealing from customers. Let me know if you want to see all of the receipt or proof"

"Tried to pay import duty online, website wouldn't take Visa, Amex, nor Paypal

Paid by phone. No one notified Mexico or Mexico Staff doesn't care enough to read the notifications or something. Wasted nearly 6 hours of my life trying to get a package that was fully paid on Monday. Maybe I'll get it today after finally finding someone at the US UPS to call someone in Mexico, I'm not holding my breath. No one in Mexico UPS cares about anything other than their phones and when it is time to go home.

UPS and Yodel must be the worst couriers in the known world. I’ve had so many problems with UPS (16000 reviews averaging 1 star speaks for itself)."
"I waited two days at home at the days they said the package would be delivered. No doorbell, no paper in the letterbox that they try to come etc. After that i emailed them if i could pick it up at a pick up center. They referred me to a pick up center 45minutes from my house. I went there, and the place seemed not to be a pick up point. there was a big poster on the door with 'THIS IS NOT A PICKUP POINT, THERE ARE NO PACKAGES HERE: UPS KNOWS THIS AS WELL'. I called them the day after and said it was a system-problem, and sended me to another pickup center in Berlin in the Nord, also 1 hour from my house. I was at the pickup center... They told me, no your package is not here. it is in Hoppengarten (Another hour from my house in the South), which i had to go there the day after.

Even though friends of min warned me to receive packages through UPS due to there unreliable service, I was soo schocked it was this bad.

The two ladies who helped me at the pick-up centers where really really friendly and understanding tho. they also said there Callcenter is a complete mess because of they have these people sitting randomly around the whole world.

If I ever see on a webshop my package would be delivered with UPS i directly decline my order. Never again."
"Awful service!!

Had to sign for parcel. So I indicated a day on their website I would be available and for it to be delivered. I even had a call from the depot to say it would be out that day (after 2 failed attempts and them delivering on completely different day they originally said they’d deliver) I Waited in all day. Nothing. Finally got hold of them 5 days later. They still had the parcels but had done nothing to get in touch and tell me that!!! I ended up having to pick up from a UPS drop off centre in town which was a real pain. Only then to have the lady there have a go at me for having said items delivered there for collection as they were too large. UPS sort it out and communicate better! I probably will not order from a company again who use UPS to deliver. Too much hassle."
"I will say...and normally I don't complain about a lot of businesses but UPS has had the worst customer service I have ever dealt with! I have been dealing with a lost package since March, saying it was delivered when it in fact was not delivered. First they couldn't find it, I opened a claim and gave a number to someone stateside (I am currently deployed), they missed the call and tried calling back to a number they were given but didnt work so UPS decided to close my claim without trying to contact again...then when I call back they supposedly found it..so had to message and confirm with the driver....somehow come to find out the label was scraped off and they assumed the zip code so some customer now has my shipment in the assumed zip code. Now I'm fighting to get the insurance money for this item...which was $250. I've been hung up on...given bs answers and the run around. Even the shipper has been involved. Still nothing. Absolutely ridiculous!"
"ordered an ipad 5/8/23. processing and shipping was normal. received a notification 5/15/23 that it has finally in UPS service. got a tracking link and it said it would be delivered the 17th! i was beyond excited especially as my birthday was the 16th, and i’ve been waiting for it. today’s the 17th. checked the tracking again and everything looked good. eta was 7:00pm. an hour later i check again, to see the date now changed to the 18th at 7:00pm. what a load of bullsht. i tried calling numerous times for customer service to continuously be connected to this annoying robot that will do everything but connect you to a live person. i guarantee this company will be out of business soon. they get the worst reviews and do nothing about it. unfortunately i didn’t choose UPS to be the carrier as i didn’t have an option to. the day UPS goes out of business will be a great day. hope they rot"
I would give them a zero if I could. This has been a on going thing with them and they don't care. My house is about 400 feet away from my mailbox. They leave it on a busy street so anyone could steal it. I have had this issue since Christmas. Ups doesn't fix problems. Use different carriers.
"Very Careless, unprofessional and uncompassionate people that work there and even corporate. They mishandled my package carelessly and deliberately gave away my package to my neighbor when it specifically said #6 my door number. They are responsible for leaving the package at the door not giving away the package assuming it was the receiver I was on the phone with them all day today and they did not solve my problem,I advise anyone not to use or let UPS handle your packages if you have no control like I do I would recommend you picking up your package because these people and drivers are careless and Shaun Hinds and Scott Harris could care less."
"Why is UPS the worst delivery system… FedEx is definitely better, shoot a pigeon mail carrier is better lol Yet I had no choice but to you this joke ..I’ve been waiting all day for a package to come, 9 o’clock comes and it says attempted delivery.. ummm no you didn’t. I don’t have a gate ,you can walk right up to my house. My road has maybe 10 houses. Come on . Not sure how stupid they are, but I’m sure McDonald’s is hiring might be easier for the morons who deliver here. So now it says they handed over to my post office , but I’ll have to hope I see it in 3-7 days. Good job UPS for being the crappiest carrier service and not giving a crap because we don’t have a choice."
My packeg side it was going to come at 7:00 but never came whats going on. ???
"If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible delivery service. Usually late. I get medication delivered that needs to stay cold. I have a delivery window, yet my medication rides around in the heat all day long , never delivered during the window period. I get perishable delivered and samething happens. Boxes are clearly marked perishable, yet it doesn't seem to matter."
"UPS IS NOT RELIABLE, I SHIPPED 4 TIMES WITH THIS COMPANY AND EVERY TIME THE PACKAGE EITHER GOT DAMAGED OR LOST. IF YOU DECIDE TO SHIP WITH THESE CARELESS, ARROGANT AND DISORGANIZED COMPANY MAKE SURE YOU PRAY AND LIGHT A CANDLE OR SOMETHING. WHEN YOU TRY TO CALL THEM THEY FILTER THE CALLS THROUGH A ROBOT AND YOU HAVE TO TRICK IT IN ORDER TO BE CONNECTED TO SOME ONE.
THEY DAMAGED 3 PACKEGAES OUT OF 5 AND THEY HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING FOR OVER A WEEK. ARE THEY A LOGISTICS COMPANY OR THEY THINK THEY ARE THE CIA???"
"When you can actually reach the people who do the day to day grunt work, they're lovely. Hardworking. And apologetic. And the way this company is operating gives them endless things to apologize for. The management of UPS should be ashamed.

In a time of record-breaking business, UPS cut staff. One of their back-office workers confirmed to me today (while trying to track down a missing package) that the company had cut 80% of people in her position and she was only being called in for limited hours any more."
I didn’t get a notification that my delivery was delivered at a UPS access point. If I had not checked this myself my delivery would have been send back the next day.
"A shipping company with such bad reps they don't even want people to be able to call ups locations, or even talk to people because people cost money, also I put up notes on where my house is at, I live in a strip and ups drivers are too lazy to walk into my drive to deliver my package, you got a real issue call (877)289-6418, that is the real rep line, they can't do jack either!"
"I have never had a more frustrating experience with customer service in my life!!! I called customer service and the automated voice assistant refused to connect me with a live agent. I called 5 different number and no one picked up, seriously what is the point of even having a customer service department."
"I would rate them 0 stars if I could! There is ABSOLUTELY no way to talk to someone m! No matter what you push or what you say, the lady always says “I cannot connect you to customer service rep, have a nice day” and hangs up! It’s absolutely ridiculous! I’m trying to have multiple packages delivered to my son at a military base so it’s going through ups surepost and they’re saying “attempted delivery” but not the reason. So I call the base post office and they say that ups does this ALLLLLL the time as soon as they see it’s a base delivery! That they don’t want to go through the verification process to get on base to deliver (which takes maybe 5 min if even that) so they’ll say it was attempted but never really was. So irritating that I can’t even speak to anyone on the phone or chat! It’s all automated and unhelpful!"
"They should make it possible to rate their overall service ZERO. I was expecting a package via UPS and another via FedEx today. FedEx was capable of doing their job without a problem. By 10:03am, I had my FedEx package. I guess the UPS driver, on the other hand, decided to cut their work day short to finish their route early. Apparently, that’s okay with UPS because it happens almost every time. I’ve been home the entire day, have not stepped out of my door, but they decide to LIE and drop off my package at a pickup location for me to go get it the next day because “sorry we missed you”. How did they miss me??? I called Customer Service and, when I was finally able to find an option that would allow me to speak to a human, I get nothing but “sorry” and excuses. The package was a gift for TONIGHT and I chose that merchant for the gift precisely because it was deliverable BY TODAY.
Merchants, PLEASE, use FedEx or USPS because UPS sucks almost every time!"
"My business doesn't open until noon. UPS tries to deliver in the morning while we are closed. I tried to create an account so that I can specify a delivery time. UPS won't let me sign up because my business address is invalid. Invalid? I'm on Main St in a building that's been here decades in a town that is over 140 years old. They have delivered here many times, but my address is invalid?!?!?! There appears to be no way to speak to anyone there. Their customer service is non existent. I tried the old tricks, like pressing 0. Nothing works. They are so cheap that they can't even bother to pay for a call center in India to take care of their customers. This is why I hate USP with every fiber of my being."
"Another Disappointment. First, they lost my package, then they charged me 32.62 for weight and dimension changes to my package. My package was 3 pounds and they said it was 30 pounds. It was 2 rolled prints.."
"I just received a notification that a delivery was attempted at my address. When played back my camera, I see that a UPS delivery truck pulled up. Whoever it was, they NEVER came to my door. I was in the house at the time. No attempt was at my address."
Was told my parcel was to be delivered between 10-12 on friday. No show. waited in all day. Now i've been informed that its 10-12 monday. waited in all day. still no parcel. Absolute rubbish service. I doesn't matter though. I'm only a customer. I would imagine Ups couldn't give a crap about how I feel.
Been trying for 3 weeks to get my parcel delivery. It’s paid £40 for clearly nothing. You sign online in case you’re not in but no one pays attention 8 times I’ve signed and put left in safe place. By the time I get my garden furniture summer will be over! Customer service is useless just tells you to go online!!
They don't even try to deliver parcels... just take them directly to parcel shops which have the most ridiculous opening hours... 9am to 12pm or 3pm to 6pm - how are you supposed to pickup your parcel if you have a full time job??
I paid for overnight shipping 3 days ago and the package isn't even on the way yet.. pretty sad if you ask me
"Parcel several days late. Would be delivered between 12.00 and 17.00 today.
FIVE minutes they called to say ‘in a depot’ 40 miles away. Will be delivered tomorrow.
Feedback site claims nobody has been in each time they have tried to deliver. A LIE … I have a broken back and need the mobility scooter to get about.
Feedback site operative has no idea of how to deal with public.
I DID NOT THINK THAT A COURIER COULD BE SO USELESS AND LACKING IN COMMON DECENCY.

DO NOT USE UPS. THEY ARE RUDE AND USELESS."
"If it were possible, I would have given 0 stars. UPS customer service is so bad that it is not even possible to complain about the poor customer service. Any requests are simply ignored or you are simply lied to that they would get back to you, which never happens. The customer service does not work either by phone or by email."
"I had problems with 3 consecutive deliveries. The first was a package that required my signature, which was apparently delivered even though I did not sign for it. I then had to process a refund with the vendor who’d sold to me the shipped item, but the taxes paid on the purchase of the item could not be refunded of course, so I lost money and time, having to reorder and pick the package up myself from the vendor’s store.

Thinking that was a one-off experience, I bought another item, to be delivered to my apartment’s rental office because what could go wrong with the package if delivered to the office, right? The UPS delivery agent dropped off items for other residents that day, withheld mine (it was a high value product) and marked it as delivered. I filed a complaint and the package was delivered days later.

The third time, I request a pickup of a package I needed for my graduation 5 working days in advance, the package is picked up, but the tracking status doesn’t not update from “picked up by UPS” for over 5 days, past my graduation. I call UPS and they advise me to file a claim. Had been calling them during the week after realizing my package was not delivered on the day after it got picked up as it was supposed to, but UPS customer service promised they would check and call me back with an update. There was no update.

UPS is truly the worst delivery service you can use."
Ups lost my package. Don’t use UPS for any shipping service.
Currently work at UPS. People show up high and drunk and stay high and drunk. Supervisors also engage in the same behavior. The warehouse supervisor takes time away from people's time cards and is very scandalous. Terrible and toxic environment to be in. Most unprofessional company I've EVER worked for. I recommend NO ONE work for them. Stay away from UPS...
"There was something I needed to return to a seller. The seller arranged for the FREE pickup and return service. UPS turned up unannounced, and I missed them. I called UPS, and we agreed on another collection date. I thought that was the end of the story. Surprisingly, UPS sent me an invoice for a ""Pickup Request"" that I never requested. I called UPS and contested this wrong invoice, but they insisted I pay! It is shocking, to say the least."
Ups have no idea what’s going on . I had 4 people give me the runaround. They said they would help me but all they did was lie to me . At the end result I’m going to have a bad Mother’s Day which my package should of been delivered by Wednesday now I have to wait until Monday
Can not handle anything. Package hold hostage. Do not send back. To earn mı re money from warehouse cost. Turkey ups is the worst
"Tried to speak to a live agent, it is totally impossible! There is no options for delivery driver leaving packages at different area than what is listed in delivery instructions that are not being read. Their customer service is computer and you cant get pass the computer. It really sucks big time!"
I hate ups I don't even leave reviews but I hate this company and I still haven't received my package and everyday they keep saying it's on its way how long have they been in business and there services is this horrible man!!!
"WHAT A PIECE OF Sxxx COMPANY UPS STILL IS. THEY TELL YOU THE PACKAGE WILL BE DELIVERED THURSDAY BEFORE 7 PM, AND SHORTLY BEFORE 7PM THEY QUICKLY SWITCH IT TO MONDAY !!!
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THEY PULLED THIS STUNT.."
"To: Thomas Olsen and the public, on Today may 12,2023, I’ve been home all day and ups claimed that they delivered my pkg, I have video surveillance as well, so I know that they never came. I called customer service for ups to report this lie. Ups customer service lied and said someone would reach out by phone, but they never called. Don’t use Ups they’re stealing peoples pkgs . To sum It up, they lied and confirmed delivery for May 11, 2023 then for May 12, 2023 but I still haven’t received my pkg. Damn liars, Send me my money or Items period!!!"
I can never get my packages on time they lie and say they made a attempt or they say can’t find the address especially when they literally just deliver a package the day before I hate companies using UPS to deliver things that’s ordered through them I never get my packages on time FedEx is the best I have no problems with them
On 5/10/2023 I called UPS in Riviera Beach Florida and gave them the correct address to where my mother's flowers are supposed to be delivered. And today is Friday and the flowers still have not been delivered. So I had to order a new set of flowers from a different florist which were delivered today which cost me $100. Is UPS going to reimburse me $100
"I'll wait all day for a UPS delivery and suddenly, there will be an email saying they attempted delivery. Really? I was home and the doorbell works. How could that be? Hmm. No paper notice of a failed delivery. No sign at all that the driver actually was here. Then, I'm told the package will be delivered days later at an ""access center"" miles away from me. This has happened countless times. Complained to the manager and got nothing but condescension. They are the worst."
"The driver didn’t even knock or tell us that he was here. My boyfriend and I were home actually waiting for the package. Now we are empty handed. On top of that, we called customer service told us the distribution people would call us in an hour or less. They never did. Highly annoyed and disappointed in UPS I’m a delivery driver for Amazon so without even calling to make sure the customer was home is ridiculous."
They are starting to get lazy by saying they can’t find your address so you have to go and pick up your deliveries.
"Garbage delivery company. Every single package I've gotten from them has been ordered as a home delivery and failed, thus postponed. Never any contact to actually deliver, they just don't care."
UPS has been delivering damaged and destroyed packages and not paying claims. The latest is this one that was just returned to us damaged. 1Z0729V51295786064 I will be leaving One Star Reviews every time they do this.
It's been 2weeks and I am still waiting for my parcel. A label was created on the 28/04/23 today the 12/05 and it still hasn't arrived and the item is needed for Sunday the 14th. I tried to call them but couldn't get hold of a human being. I will never use them again and will not recommend to family and friends.
Got an email that they could not deliver my package which is a big lie as both my wife and me has been home all day and our surveillance show no one entering our property at time. Will never ever recommend using UPS at any time.
These guys are scammers if you order from the internet ask if it’s UPS and if so avoid. Lies lies and more lies
UPS drivers drive right by your location and mark package is delivered. Meanwhile they never delivered anything
I ordered a swing set for my son and the UPS driver was very rude!! He dropped off my swing set in the grass and I asked if he could put it on the porch because it was about to rain and he told me have a nice day and drove off. I am 100 lbs and couldn't pick it up!! My neighbor had to help me!! Worst ups driver ever we need a new one and he needs to be fired!
"Rug was delivered to a shop, when I was expecting it to be delivered to my home. Unfortunate UPS has a problem finding my house, which is difficult to find, so happy to have got my purchase, but would have appreciated being asked where I would like it delivered."
"I ordered a business computer from a seller upstate and, against my wishes, they shipped it with UPS. I paid for faster shipping to get it to me Wednesday, but they told me today instead. What's bad is I wouldn't be home to sign for it, so I rushed my duties so I would be home. Fast-forward and I get told my package cannot come by because I have moved from my home?! I've lived here since 2015. I called customer support and they were extremely rude, did not speak very fluently, and told me that after I confirmed my address that I'd have to wait AGAIN for my package. I now have missed time from work to be there for a package that won't come by until TWO days later at an ADDITIONAL fee, and have to rush at my job again. If I had to choose between UPS and an actual snail that's only going 25% its regular speed, I'd still choose the snail.

NEVER CHOOSE UPS!"
"If I could give zero stars, I would...
Don't understand how they are still in business...
Really don't...not a single delivery or pick up has ever worked as it should, NOT one!"
"My package has been lost twice at ups and both were expensive items. It is the one and same store at mankato, the store near river hills mall. The first time I dropped an iphone 12 for a return to Backmarket, I never got my refund and then I noticed they never received it, I went to ask them and the awful lady that I gave my phone had been so rude to me, she said my phone was not there and she even yelled at me. I filed a complaint, nothing. I discovered they shipped my phone to another address I had to struggle, threaten the person with a police complaint to get it. Now I have another shipment that just vanished. Ups website is telling me to complain at the store and the store gave me ups number to call. These people are just awful and I suspect some of the workers are stealing packages. Very very very bad company"
"Great service, super-fast delivery, from USA to Serbia 4 days and 5th - delivery. Courriers kind, agreeable . Excellent experience 2 times."
"Do Not ship with UPS

I had a terrible experience with UPS as they simply left my package at the wrong address, at the same number in a similar sounding road, only the postcode was completely different.

Also their app and customer communication could be more messy. If you want to tell them you will be out and to leave with a neighbour or on a safe place it's more are less imposible.

How can they get something so simple wrong. A joke. Avoid them"

"I shipped a parcel to Cameroon more than a month ago and it’s still not reach it’s destination, tried seeking help from works UPS Cameroon they were all rude to me and no one will even reply you mail or pick your call. I friend told me they will not deliver your parcel to destination and will withhold it and ask you for tips if not you will not get them . My parcel has a destination and it’s still not reached its destination."
"Disgusting work! UPS lost my package with documents and medical images. The parcel was to be handed over against signature. The package was from Arkansas to California. The result of the investigation was not provided. Terrible experience. Disrespectful attitude towards the client. No compensation. Terrible, never use their services."
"UPS is a bunch of f-ing liars! If I could give zero stars, I would.

My package was ""out for delivery"" this morning. Just tracked it and it says they made 2 failed delivery attempts. That is simply not true. I work from home - my desk is two feet from my front door, so I know they were never here. I also have a Ring doorbell camera that clearly shows that no one walked up to my door today - more proof that they were never here. At no point did they attempt to deliver it once, let alone twice. My conclusion is that they are flat out liars!

My package isn't life or death ... I'd be fine if they brought it tomorrow, or the next day, or even the day after that. So why can't they just be honest and say ""we're sorry, we're running behind and we'll deliver it tomorrow."" Instead, they'd rather lie and say they were here twice when they were never here at all.

UPS used to be trustworthy and reliable, but now they just lie and blame their customers for their own faults. UNACCEPTABLE."
If I could do zero stars I would. Twice I've had the sorry we missed you paper signed and on my door and still didn't get my package. Ups is the biggest joke ever. Drivers need to learn how to check so see if the stupid paper is signed or not. It shouldn't take 4 phone calls and week to get a package due to lazy delivery drivers.
"My brother shipped me a stained glass window from the Tucson Arizona ups store.
It arrived cracked . He had purchased insurance for it and it had fragile/ glass stickers on the packaging.
When I went through the process of filing a claim, I realized they have intentionally made it very difficult to get compensation. I provided photos and explanations but the claim was denied. The corporate policy is to kick it back to the store that shipped it. So I called the Tucson store and they said it had been shipped in an inadequate package. I said if so why would you ship it and why would you sell insurance?
…… what a joke, but unfortunately the joke is on me.
DONT USE UPS They have a system that is unfair and intentionally abrogates their responsibilities."
"Assume nothing other then Internal Theft of A package valued over $600 and They blow me off passing blame. but are still in possession of my item after 3 months. Beware!! if an item is stolen or lost internally They will do nothing for the customer. The customer is responsible to add insurance on to every package to protect yourself even from UPS internal malicious or purposeful damage or theft. cant say it any better, This is not a rant , this is a Buyer Beware. I lost out and no accountability on the Person who is using my fan. they took my package I sent in good faith, will not investigate or find it. even though it never left there distribution warehouse. they passed blame to a ups store where it was in fact picked up then never moved after that. Disgusting!!! tracking number 1Z14V36V030211195
Authorities say I can file a criminal complaint and the amount is grand theft. maybe best to just start wasting there time in court proceeding's and I will make sure to subpoena as Many people that would be involved down the chain. I know it sounds drastic but I dont know why I nor anyone should stand back and be Violated by a possible criminal act. If they told me it was damaged or even fell off a truck i would be much more understanding then just saying too bad, your loss!"
"Picture packed and shipped by UPS, arrived destroyed. Pictures taken (over 60), receipt of painting and you still declined the insurance, I did everything correctly and you still screwed me in the end. You r the most pathetic company I've ever dealt with and that says a lot since we have to deal with Fed Ex as well. I will show my pictures and typed up outline of this whole process to everyone I can... what scum!"
"After receiving my Auction wins broken from a shipment sent by UPS store 1747 in New Windsor, NY. Then I put insurance claims with UPS - NOW ALL I GET FROM UPS AUTOPHONE MONITOR IS THAT I CAN NOT TALK TO A REAL PERSON AND IT HANGS UP ON ME!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE RECEIVED 2 MAILED LETTERS STATING THE SHIPPING BY UPS STORE IN NEW WINDSOR, NY #1747 DID NOT PACK UP TO UPS PACKING STANDARDS, WHICH I AM SOOOOO OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF RECEIVING 4 BROKEN ANTIQUE PLATES!!!!!! I CONTACTED THE STORE AND THEY WON'T HELP ME!!!! HOW CAN I GET A REAL PERSON TO HELP ME WITH A CLAIM WITH UPS? A REAL PERSON! NOT A AUTOMATED HANG UP, OR A UPS STORE SAYING CAN'T HELP YOU OR A LETTER SAYING CLAIM IS OVER BECAUSE THEIR UPS STORE DID NOT PACK TO STANDARDS. WHY AM I HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS INCOMPETENCE WITH ALL THE DEPARTMENTS IN UPS? I JUST WANTED MY AUCTION WINS SHIPPED TO ME IN ONE PIECE."
"Impossible to get in touch with them, nor sending en email, impossible to pick a better suited day for delivery. It’s a hot mess I always pray that my sender use anything other then ups"
"Driver drove down the road - slowed down, looked at the house - did not stop or get out the van - and then they say 'customer not available' - I was there watching him - no attempt to deliver."
Amazon is AMAZING! UPS is the most customer unfriendly business I have interacted with. They say they delivered your package when it wasnt. There is NO VIDEO PROOF OF DELIVERY. Amazon is amazing! UPS do NOT let you speak with a US based agent. I tried to file a claim but the system says the tracking number is NOT valid but shows delivered. I dont know who the phucking CEO is but he needs to get his sshhit together!
"they put my more than40 packages on the street and covered my shop and all the path. People can’t walk through.
I tried to ask them put them in front of my back door and there is a huge parking area. They just say no. After I reject to sign I received these packages. They trying to call the police say I illegally take packages…what a f!!!!"
"The most garbage 1800 number I've ever called. Asks you for info, you tell it, it gets it wrong 10 god damn times. you manually enter it in and it STILL GETS IT WRONG.
And they REALLY like to push their delays off on weather. However when you pull up the weather where they claim the delay was you'll see something like a rain storm for a half hour and they're hamming it up as a natural disaster. Garbage company, Garbage values (lack there of), and the operators are literally the most useless people on the face of the earth. They can't even answer simple questions like, why cant I pick it up from the local facility its at? ""Oh because it was delayed in kt"". Yes. but its here. ""The weather in KT delayed it"". They're so dumb they can't even tell when you're clearly onto their bs.
Garbage company UPS and you I hope you collapse as the garbage company you are."
WHY ARE UPS DRIVERS SOOO LAZY???? EVERTIME I ORDER SOMETHING IT UNFORTUNATELY IS SHIPPED BY UPS. THEY JUST LEAVE THERE TRUCKS RUNNING AND JUST THROW YOUR PACKAGE ANYWHERE IT LANDS. THIS GUYS NEED A GOOD A** KICKING TO AT LEAST RING A BELL OR KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR TO LET YOU KNOW YOUR PACKAGE HAS ARRIVED. UPS SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN UNTIL THEY KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THESE TRUCK DRIVERS. AMEN
"UPS and FedEx are the slowest, most unreliable shipping couriers in existence. Both terrible."
"I would rate UPS 0 out of 5 stars if possible. I have shipped a LOT using this company. Last fall, it so happened that three items I shipped all arrived damaged. I refunded customers, and since I buy insurance for every shipment, I decided to make a claim for the most damaged item. I followed the UPS claims policy and submitted the appropriate info. Six weeks later I had heard nothing. I contact UPS several times by phone and each time it was very difficult to reach a claims person (they hide in customer service) and none of them are employed in Canada or the US. Each person GAVE ME A DIFFERENT STORY. One person finally said they had lost or never received my original documents I had submitted. So I resent my documents by mail and email (copies as I no longer had the originals). Six weeks later and still no response. I keep calling and every time the person asks me for my case number and info and says someone will call me back and no one ever does. I finally managed to get someone on the phone again who told me my claim had been approved but they needed additional info. I send the info and then they say they need to look into it more and call me back. No one calls back. I finally reached a 'supervisor' on the phone after 2 hours of holds and transfers who also told me my claim was approved and needed more information. He gave me his email address and I sent the info. He responded several days later and forwarded a message from a different department that says that I need to re-send the documentation by snail mail. Obviously at this point - six months later - I am very annoyed. I write back by email and recap my entire experience. Three weeks later (now 7.5 months from claim date) I receive an email from an anonymous bot that they have denied my claim because shippers need pre-approval from UPS before shipping fragile items. Seriously?!?!?!? How is this possible???? Their insurance and claims process is A TOTAL SCAM"
"No call or email before delivery.
When i call she drop call on me.
This company have serious employee problem in professional way dealing with clients."
"Awful awful service!! I would not reccomend this company to my enemie. These people are very disregarding when they mess something up with your package. They are hard to get ahold of & will promise to correct the issue but they dont!! I was told several times id be called back regarding my package i had expedited twice now the second time they sent me the wrong package no where near what i was waiting for, wasnt the same name nor adress on this package! It seems whoever deleivered was paying zero attention and the fact i keep getting disregarded by customer service representatives tells me UPS could really care less!!!!!!!! Anyone reading this if you want to save your time, money & would prefer to keep your patience in tact do not use this service or if this is the service offered for your delivery through a third party it would be in your best interest to request a different carrier!!!!!!"
DO NOT!! Under any circumstances use UPS to ship packages over seas as they post low prices in the US initially but will charge double or triple the cost while it’s in customs at the current country or destination nor will they deliver it to the recipient!! Btw you will spend weeks filling out invoices with description of exactly what your delivering so they can charge taxes and many other fees with it.. also they will not ship the package back to you unless you pay an astronomical fee to get it back so they pretty much hold your package until you pay double the prices for them to release it.. two months have passed and my friend still hasn’t gotten her package!! Unbelievable 😒
Worst experience ever- do not use UPS. They have the worst customer service. I tried calling and was greeted by an automative voice system that is not intuitive by any means. The system would not just accept if I wanted to talk to a representative. if by a Miracle you make it through to an actual person there is no help. They just tell you there is nothing they can do. All I wanted was to change my delivery to a pick up and they told me they couldn’t but would make three attempts to drop it off first…..doesn’t make much sense as I will be going out of town and need it to be routed to a facility where I can pick it up…..
"My package arrived to my home partially open. When I looked inside one of my items was missing. I immediately put in a claim. Over a year later, my claim has yet to be refunded. After multiple calls to UPS the tell me they can't do anything because the sender has yet to respond. When I inquire as to why they haven't followed up being as though the claim is over a year old, they tell me that I need to contact the sender myself and refused to follow up. Horrible customer service. Now I'm out over $100 because their employees are thieves and they refuse to take accountability."
Driver lied and said we refused a package - and had not ordered it. They sent it back to sender. Documents were time sensitive and needed for legal procedure. It should have been taken to a UPS Center where I could at least pick it up but the driver took that away by lying. Talked to Marcus and Daz. They were so sorry. So what? This doesn't fix a problem they created through their employee's dishonesty. Ugh. Too big to care. underwhelming. Unacceptable. I am so mad and UPS stinks.
The automated system is a waste of time and is no help!!!! Packages are NEVER on time. UPS is a big liability for local business owners. UPS is a waste of time and money. I even have packages deliver to the UPS store!! and still is no where to be found...
U guys suck I can't write instructions how to find my address. And u want to charge me to hold it at ups and to change my address u guys suck
Utterly disgraceful shipping cost almost triple what usps would charge and double what fedex does
Ups is so bad and every something goes wrong with them. Don't know why Amazon us them to be honest just terrible service...
"I sent a package through UPS. I requested a return to sender because I enclosed the wrong stuff. I was told on two separate occasions that it will be returned to me. In fact I double and triple repeated my address. It was not returned to me! Yet they said it was returned, however, when I looked online with the tracking number it was sent and received in another state. I called and was told… “I received it”, case closed.

UPS has the worse customer service! I lost out on a $200 dollar item and UPS will do nothing!

Whatever you do… Do Not use UPS for sending packages."
UPS has become completely unreliable. The delivery status is never accurate and often changes to conflict with previous status. When they don’t feel like making the delivery they report any number of excuses none of which are based in reality. It is impossible to get human assistance so the recipient if left with no realistic expectation of when their merchandise may be delivered assuming it ever actually arrives.
UPS has stolen my parcel. This is the third time they have mismanaged my parcel but previously at least I received my parcel after a long wait this time they lost it and an unprofessional investigation was launched with no outcome. They do not bother to inform you about your parcel you have to keep chasing them and still no solution. I am fed up with this company. People should go for legal action against UPS.
"I ordered some desperately needed brake rotors through Amazon. As per UPS policy (which they flake on regularly) they ""aren't allowed to leave packages in apartment buildings"". So every package shipped by them goes to a UPS location for me to pick up. My most recent order (for my rotors) was marked as being at an access point inside a Michael's, then switched overnight to a UPS store location 3 miles from my closest UPS store. When I tried to retrieve my package, I was informed their system marks it as having been delivered, but Friday deliveries don't actually get delivered to them until Monday...This is a shipping company that does not actually reliably track or accurately report their deliveries. The right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. If I could give 0 stars, I would. There's a reason they're ranked as the 445th courier in the US."
"1st! The outsourced customer service is HORRIBLE. 2nd! I PAID to have a couch delivered on a specific date because I work swing shift and my schedule makes it very difficult for any free time to handle personal business. UPS actually changed my delivery date, THREE TIMES, without my knowledge. 3rd! The ""automated"" system seems to be hard of hearing and/or doesn't understand English and you will NOT get a call back from anyone after being completely stressed out over dealing with it. Lastly! If I ever deal with another company who works through UPS...all deals are off!"
"Next day air does not mean the same thing to UPS that it does to the receiver! I just thought FE was bad. UPS customer service, if you can get a human is bad. The automated phone crap show is the worst!!! Item shipped May 3 next day air and I still do not have my package on May 6😡"
"THE WORST! I have had so many frustrating experiences with UPS that it would take up much more space than I have available to write. Their customer service is nightmarish, delivery is dysfunctional and if you’re lucky enough to get your delivery on time, there is a very high possibility that it will be damaged. I don’t know how a business can operate like this."
"I missed my Thursday delivery at home , the ticket Said will be delivered next buisness day , I was near the front door all day long thinking the delivery would show up , at 530 pm I looked online and it said they tried 2nd attempt at 1230 pm which is a total lie ...UPS hopefully goes outta buisness because they are HORRIBLE at delivery don't wait all day the next day for them go out and enjoy your life because they are thee worst delivery company out there ."
"Extremely poor service. Package booked for collection. Package not collected. No communication as to why package not collected despite having phone number.
I had to ring up several days later to clarify what the situation was. No explanation given as to why not collected

Complaints department just fobbed me off"
"I was told that a package would arrive at 7:00pm on May 5, 2023 (Friday). I tracked the package all along the way and multiple days back said the same thing - it would be in my possession by 7pm on May 5. I called in at 4pm offering to pick up my package at the UPS facility only to have UPS tell me ""No, it is out on delivery."" At 7pm on May 5, no package. I called in and UPS said it'd arrive no later than 8pm. No package at 8pm. I called in again and the customer service representatives told me that it was out on delivery (of which was a lie). I called in at 9pm and they said to wait as it was still out on delivery. I went to the facility at 10:15pm on May 5 to find it closed. I called customer service again to find out that it will not be available until Monday, May 8. All week long on the tracking website it said specifically 7:00pm on Friday, May 5. It is after 1am on May 6 and the tracking now says, ""The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible."" Throughout this entire process UPS has been deceptive and dishonest. I filed a complaint with the BBB over this."
"Very disappointed with UPS . I sent back my Bose soundbar for repair at the beginning of March. Bose sent me a QR code to send the soundbar back via “UPS.”

UPS lost my soundbar and Bose said to me two weeks ago they would be sending me a replacement. On the 3/5/23 I spoke to Bose on the phone and they said I was a priority and that I’d here from them the following day 4/5/23.

I phoned them back today and they would not replace or refund as UPS have not closed their investigation (Eight weeks on!!.)

I do not recommend UPS as their customer service is terrible!!."
"Package was to be delivered today. Later saw a text that the address was wrong and couldn't be delivered. After an hour and many, many calls, we finally were able to talk to a person instead of a robot. She verified the address was right. Guess the driver had other things to do besides his job. Now the package won't be out for delivery until at least Monday."
"They constantly delivering my packages to the wrong house. They leave your things wherever they feel like throwing it out in the open. I really dislike them. I have my address on my house, on a sign and on my mailbox. Can you people read numbers!"
"My sister sent me a package and said the employee gave a delivery date of May 3. I waited until today, May 5 then decided to track it myself. When I found the information, I saw that ⚠️Damage was reported. It was out for delivery, possibly nearby. The tracking said (and I quote), “All merchandise is missing and the empty carton discarded. UPS will notify the sender.“
Oh well. I guess that’s how UPS does their business."
"Had a package that was never actually attempted to be delivered, they basically just sent it directly to their local pickup facility and never informed me that was being done. Heard nothing from them until package was sent back to where I originally shipped it from. Local UPS store refused shipping charge refund even though they agreed that's what happened, called corporate after the store attempted to call as well, corporate refused to admit guilt and says its been too long to do anything about it now even though it was the local store and corporate giving me the run around the whole time.

Tl:Dr, package never actually attempted to be delivered, corporate says local store needs to handle refund, local store says corporate needs to handle refund, no one answers my questions until it's too late to even get a refund."
"They have repeatedly delivered to a retail location rather than delivering to my home. They have lost packages and on the occasions when I have paid to have a package delivery location changed, they accept the payment but do not change the delivery location. Customer service is horrible. They try to blame the customer for poor delivery service."
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST COMPANY FOR DELIVERY!!! I TOOK OFF TODAY TO MAKE SURE I GET MY PACKAGE!!! THE STUPUD DELIVERY PERSON NEVER KNOCKED ON THE DOOR BUT THEY PUT A STICKER ON THE DOOR AND STATED I WASN'T HOME!!! THESE GUYS ARE THE WORST!!! I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE IN BUSINESS!!! I LITERALLY HATE UPS!!! TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM AMAZON!!!
"I was in my living room when they attempted to deliver two packages, didn't actually knock, just left a notice. Said they would try again next bay between 12 and 7, I'm not waiting all day for their stupid drivers. Paid to have them hold it at a UPS store, website wouldn't let me change second one. Called customer service after yelling at a useless computer, a human said their computer was down call back in a few hours. They are absolutely worthless, I would much rather deal with the USPS than the brown morons."
My package came looking like a group of elephants ran it over! I'm glad nothing in it was fragile!
"Tracked my package it said it was delivered to my front porch when it was in fact delivered to the next towns post office.! Since the driver didn't actually deliver it to my address I can't make a claim with UPS!!
They should not be allowed to say they delivered things to your home when they in fact didn't!! That seems extremely shady of them to do so they can not be held accountable for the lost or damaged packages!!
I will NEVER USE UPS AGAIN!!
OH and don't even bother calling their 1-800 number you will not get a human. only a annoying automated robot that'll keep asking you for a tracking number and then hang up on you.. the UPS is the laziest delivery service in the U.S!"
"I have worked with UPS for years. Wether through my my retail job or through ordering items online and having them delivered by UPS.
I am not one to leave reviews good bad or otherwise for companies but this experience was flat out ridiculous.

I ordered an couple items for a gift.
The order was placed, address confirmed on the invoice. I even had multiple eyes look at the address to be sure it was correct. Street address + apartment #.... package was supposed to be delivered last night...UPS stated there was an address issue. I called UPS this morning. I paid $15 extra for express shipping....

UPS tells me the apartment number is missing. I worked in retail customer service I know to double check addresses etc. UPS either 1.) Didn't want to deliver that late because deliveries took too long so they went back to the station and made up a reason to delay the package (yes my husband worked for delivery companies and a friend works for them too).
2.) Their system doesn't register line two of addresses. (Which I know they do because the rep just told me they ""fixed it"")
Or
3.) They were not paying attention and brought it back and again had to come up with a reason as to why the package was not delivered.

My issue is not with when it would be delivered...but rather the out right lying they did. And the rudeness in which I was treated. I was hung up on and wasn't even given a reference number for the call to prove I had contacted UPS...
When I call to ask what's wrong and why you don't have my address printed correctly when I am looking at the correct invoice customer service wise it's not your job to tell the customer that ""the address was incorrect and there was no apartment number."" When there absolutely was!

If you were just honest with me it would have been fine but if your system is so broken that it doesn't translate an apartment number on a package??? You need a new system...and it's not the workers fault it's the companies fault for not making better choices.

If I can help it I don't use UPS for ANYTHING. Because even the USPS is better than UPS...at least the addresses are correct and I know EVENTUALLY it will get to the correct place...

Ive filed for a refund from the company I purchased from for UPS's poor customer service and blatant lies. And when I get the package I'll check to see about the shipping label and if there was an actual misprint of labels if I can.

Do better UPS and that doesn't mean treat your employees like crap, it means be honest with people if you can't make the delivery then state that. Don't lie about an address being wrong to cover your butts...I'm trying to teach kids not to blatantly lie to people not to boldly stand before.me and LIE because that habit gets you in trouble later on...and what do you tell these kids when they get older and everyone tells them lying is okay??? That lying is how you stay in business...the core values people learn as children fly out the window as adults and it's sad...the CEOs and managers need to recognize that not just worry about their product and company stop lying to people. Be honest. If your system didn't catch the second address line say that. Computers make mistakes all the time. It happens. Then state it's been corrected now and you are good to go. Not a standard flat answer of sorry for the inconvenience. It's fixed. There was not apartment number.

Just stop lying to people.
Be honest.
The world will be better for it.
Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! They have hidden fees and charge you extra once a parcel has been delivered!!!!!!! They cannot explain what the extra charges are to me. They also tried charging my friend $50 to receive a chocolate Easter egg that was sent as a gift!!!! THEN to make it worse, when my friend wouldn't pay this ridiculous charge, they then charged me £40 to have the chocolate egg sent back to me!!!!!! There should not have been any extra charges in the first place, this was a gift sent to a friend, no commercial value and the correct size/weight. Will NEVER use this company again!!!"
"They had not deliveried my packages . You call but person ever. This sucks, I'll use FedEx are somebody else. Ups don't give a DAMN"
Will not deliver to my house always access point which is 2 blocks away always access point never my house lazy people
"The UPS delivery system is awful. They do not let you know that your package needs to be picked up. Now my package is lost. The support is non-existing. UPS could learn a lot from Amazon, they know how to ship and take care of their customers!"
"Most UPS Drivers are very, very unprofessional, angry issues and with no communication (matter) skills in how to treat customers. Now I understand what UPS stand for: Unprofessional People Services..."
"Terrible service. Waiting around for days for nothing. Missed work. 500$ in lost wages. Will never use this carrier or anyone who ships with them. Refund in process, vendor can find their crap."
"Zero customer support
Just lip service.
Went to wrong address and said I wasn't there"
"Once again when I talked to a supervisor and told her the package was my meds,she called Jacksonville and the driver had it here within the hour,big tks ti supervisor, line workers ,customer service, and a big shout out to truck driver he's the best"
"UPS sent me 3 emails stating my package was delivered to my address to a person named genesis. These are time sensitive extremely urgent confidential documents sent by a financial company. I reported the package lost. I agonized about the possibility of our identities handed to a stranger overnight. Then in the morning a person from the UPS call center overseas calls me and asked me if I had picked up my package.
It turned out it was delivered to an access point. I went to that place only to be treated like an idiot by this person.
All you had to do UPS is say “package undeliverable, pick up at access point” DO NOT SAY delivered to home to name.
That’s very erroneous information that cost people time, resources, energy!!!
I called all the 800 and 888 numbers given to me by each of the persons I talked to. All of those people just memorized a line that ends up in another 800 number!!!"
Horrible service - my package was going from Toronto to Woodbridge two weeks ago and they still haven't found it. Terrible customer service. I will never use UPS again
"absolutely horrible! The person who delivered my package didn't even knock on the door, and the fact that he threw my package on my porch was just outright rude!"
"Was forced to pay 206,45€ in customs in Athens Greece for a used Jacket shipping to my dad."
"May 2023: Real life nightmare experience:
This is the worst company ever, with extremely rude delivery drivers and unreliable service. UPS was paid for express delivery of a time sensitive package requiring signature release to my home on 05-02-2023. The dumb delivery driver decided to come in the middle of the day when normal people are at work. As soon as I got back around 2pm and saw the notice, I called UPS and alerted them that they were paid extra delivery charges because this is a time sensitive package. I was told the driver would be back within an hour to deliver it. Of course that didn't happen. I ended up having to call UPS a total of 5 times between 2pm and 10pm, asking for my package and each time I was told the driver was on his way. They eventually never delivered the package that day and it cost me a lot of money because I couldn't meet a deadline.
I am consulting with an attorney to evaluate possible lawsuit.
This company is the scum of the earth and should be avoided, if possible. Look at their average review score - less than 2 points!
I truly wish it was possible to give them a zero score because that's what they deserve."
"UPS is one of the worse shipment companies . They lost my order twice . One of the order had a jewelry , I wonder why they marked my order as delivered and I never got it . I can’t even get though a real person on the phone to make a complaint about my lost order . Horrible, horrible service . Extremely unreliable and shady, and dishonest"
"Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! No matter what you throw in front of this kid, he handles it with ease.He Greets everyone with a smile and wishes them a great rest of their day! 😁👍👍👍. 2485 Notre Dame Blvd. Ste 370. Chico Ca."
My husband's been sitting at the window for 2 days waiting on a financial package and now it's going to cost us an extra $150 on our rent if not more because for every day it's late that's an extra $50 that we have to pay for late charges so thank you very much UPS should I use FedEx at least I know I would have got my package
"OH BOY LET ME HAVE JUST 1 MINUTE WITH OUR UPS DRIVER. (PLEASE). OUR DRIVER HERE AT SALEM HARBOUR APARTMENTS THINKS HE IS AT ATCO DRAGWAY. I WAS WAITING FOR DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO COME TO ME. WELL IT NEVER CAME AS THEY ARE SAYING IT DID!,
THIS DRIVER CAN’T EVEN RING THE DOOR BELL OR KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR HE JUST THROWS IT WHEREVER HE DAMN WELL PLEASES. SO I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS NOW FOR 1 WEEK AND STILL NOTHING. I NEED MY MEDICAL SUPPLIES LIKE YESTERDAY BUT I HAVE YET TO GET ANYONE TO HELP ME. YOU PEOPLE SUCK AND YOUR DRIVERS SUCK. I AM NOW AT A STANDSTILL AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL I CAN DO. I NEED HELP ASAP."
So I just got a delivery at my door. The driver didn’t knock or ring the bell just threw it on the porch. The package was half opened this happens all the time now the service is so bad. I worked at UPS for 32 years I’m embarrassed to say I did.
"We were awaiting an important parcel and paid extra to have it delivered to our address on time.
There were no updates on the site, it stayed that delivery was attempted which was a lie as we were home. After numerous phone call to UPS to find our package we were told that it was on the truck to be delivered. We stayed home for 4 days, yet no delivery attempt on UPS part, no updates on the tracking site.
We finally went to the local UPS store to find that our package was sitting there for days.
Honestly the worst company to deal with. Will never hire them again"
For the third time in 3 years UPS has managed to screw up a shipment to me. This is after the shipment made it most of the way across the USA and got lost in their facility in my home state. Same thing happened before. I'm so sick of these clowns I had to post a review. Total value of their screwed up shipments comes to almost $900.
"I was sending a very important document to France should be delivered by Thursday. They keep holding it and not delivered while I am calling everyday asking to return the package. Every phone call or email I get different reply misleading me. I lost a lot of time and business wise and did not get my document back, now even if I got it back will be too late. I used UPS thinking that will be faster than Royal Mail, I was mistaken, I will never use this company again.
Really very frustrating and unprofessional customer service. My last call was today, when I asked to speak to supervisor she kept on hold for few seconds and then she came back saying he is in a meeting and cannot talk to you. When I asked for her name she gave me a first name which is very common and refuse to realise her full name."
"My parcel was delivered to this country 2 weeks ago but not delivered. I have e-mailed UPS who tell me that they are coordinating with the relevant team! I phoned and first off was put through to a machine which just repeated the tracking information that I already had. I eventually got through to a person in the import department who couldn't help, so I was put through to customer services. Unfortunately, though she repeated herself a number of times, I have no idea what she was trying to tell me.
UPS have usually been good, but their customer services is, to all intents and purposes, non-existent.
I still haven't got my parcel."
"Lazy drivers who lie all the time and “pretend” they tried to deliver, say I was not at home when I clearly was!!!!!!!"
"I wish I could give 0 stars but I can’t, I ordered my package 4 days before they told me it was on its way and would arrive the next few hours which was pretty quick and I liked that but that’s when all of a sudden they say my address was wrong and that they were going to fix it and send it so it delayed for a day but then like a week goes by and the status is still the same and they haven’t even changed the address or done nothing. They didn’t even call me to correct the address and they didn’t even let me change it because the employees said they didn’t have access to change it and only the shipper had access and then another week goes by and I finally figured out where it was and I had to pick it up from an hour of driving because they couldn’t ship it to me. This is the worst shipping company EVER."
"HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE----if you call endless auto generated computers service.
NO LIVE PERSON actually ever answers....messages left go unanswered.
TRACKING pages are rarely updated or accurate.
IMPORTANT OVERNIGHT DELIVIES are late----BY THREE (3) DAYS!!!

I would N E V E R ship UPS---this was a vendor choice. I use USPostal Service....or better yet---AMAZON PRIME!!!

Big BLUE Trucks kill UPS horrible delivery ratings!!!!"
Stopped off to drop off a few packages and selby with Samone (sp?). She was quick to smile randomly extremely helpful. I was in and out in a tenth of the time i expected and couldn’t ask for a better customer experience.
THE BATTERIES IN MY X RAY VISION ARE DEAD. CANNOT SEE THROUGH THE WALLS IN MY HOUSE. CANNOT SEE WHEN UPS IS AT MY GATE. SO MANY TIMES UPS WONT PICK UP PACKAGE BECAUSE THE IDIOT DRIVER THINKS NO ONE HOME. ALL THE IDIOT DRIVER HAD TO DO WAS HONK OR WALK UP TO THE DOOR. NO DOG IN YARD NO ELECTRIC FENCE. DAY AFTER DAY MY PACAKAGE SITS IN THE RAIN BECAUSE UPS A HOLE DRIVER JUST LOOKS AT THE BOX AND LEAVES A LABEL OR NOTE SAYING SORRY WE MISSED YOU. TOO LAZY TO WALK UP TO DOOR OR HONK. UPS SUCKS WHAT A HORRIBLE COMPANY.
"I expected a small package from Amazon via UPS! Yes UPS, not the usual USPS, UPS service is pathetic. I got an email saying ""Wrong apartment number on package, unable to deliver."" The right address and apartment number was correct on the package. There is a front desk person, so there is absolutely no reason this inept UPS driver could not deliver it. I ended up calling Amazon and told them about this, was lied to each time I called UPS in the Philippines, of course that's the only place they have call centers for cheap. I had to keep asking them to speak slower that I'm not in their country. One hung up on me. I was told by another that dispatch couldn't get hold of the inept driver?? I was promised a call back at ""3:19"" HA, and absolutely never received it. This was just one of many upsets that UPS put me through. Pathetic, pathetic service"
Remember when UPS used to to deliver packages? Me neither. Worst website ever.
"Worst delivery service available. They lied about trying to deliver my package in saying that there was no one to sign for package. I was home all day and actually outside in my front yard and no delivery was attempted. My email also states I owe money for duties and i don't know exactly why i would owe anything as I payed for my items as well as shipping in full and everything is always calculated at checkout time. shipping was also 130.00 for a small 2 pound package which is already very expensive, i would never ever use this company for shipping anything at any cost its absolutely terrible service."
"These f**king b*stards are thieves!, how the f**ck you gonna steal my Bluetooth air pods out of the box and then ship the box?!. This dumb ass company is flawed as f**ck."
"I was having some problems and Jahdae helped me and was so patient,and helpful,i own 2 convenient store's i wish i had worker's like her she is AWESOME"
"Horrible customer service.
1. UPS is so bad at tracking: the accuracy of information from UPS tracking exposed to customer varies as they keep changing status updates with a variety of belies credulity delay reasons (weather, late flights, solemn aliens welcoming event etc). Often there are no changing delivery status at all. Stated to deliver today, but shows that package still in different country - pure nonsense!
2. Customer service of this company is useless. UPS customer service staff don’t even understand their company’s delivery system, which causes them to often give wrong suggestions when there are problems with parcel delivery or promise the customer a delivery date that cannot be achieved.
3. Stubborn, refuse to change delivery dates.
Summarizing: UPS has bad managemet system and don't care about customers. Not surprised anymore why UPS have 1 stars reviews. Simply avoid.
Not recommending to friends and family members"
This company is nothing but trash
I just got off the phone with ups customer service. First things first ups has contacted me thru email delivery postpone. On my side on 4/19 label created out to ups. Ups said they recieved it on the 4/25@6:22 don’t know if it’s am or pm when asking customer service he repeats it 6:22 which I am assuming it’s am. Tracking number I gave him was off. Found the right tracking number b4 he could go by my address. During our conversation he starts on his ups pitch which to me sounds like he is mumbling. When I first ask him if he can repeat what he just said no was his initial answer. When i tell him excuse me couldn’t understand then he repeats it. When i tell him I paid for 2nd day air. From the 25 till the 1st. It is now 6 days. And with my 6 day earlier delay between vendor and ups. No solution have to contact the shipper. And people are wondering why Amazon is doing great. I ordered something on 4/19. Got it on Monday the 24. Well I will be ordering thru amazon the most I can. Ups is slow boat from US. But almost like you are ordering something from China they might be a little earlier but not much their 2 day air hopefully will only be 6 days. Is their scheduled date for now. On their website it has all hands on deck to try and get your delivery to you. Which is why I called. Did not in anyway try to offer me a solution just went by their delivery postpone date. My local ups drivers are the best just have to say that. Sorry customer service employees you must work for a company that sucks. Just saying they should take off their website all hands on deck.
"I was waiting for a package from Spain, and they just simply send it back to the sender beacuse their faulty system wasn't recognized the scan correctly (as usual) and didn't even notified me about anything like other shipping companies do. Of course the tracking option updates after 24 hours so you can't do sh#t even if you wanted to. The Customer service can't do anything, they just checking the number related things and telling you the same thing that's on the tracking."
They don't care whether your package gets actually delivered or not. They have no problem to let it infront of your house for anyone who goes around.
"Second time in a week lying about attempted delivery. This time I sat outside my door videoing everything while the UPS truck pulled out of the apt complex across the street and never even looked my way, it would have taken 15 seconds to stop by but no another lie about attempted delivery. I feel this one was retaliation for previous reviews and also discrimination against the elderly and disabled. In this day and age package thieves are everywhere and UPS will not even knock when they do make a delivery even if you put a big sign on you door requesting them to like I have. I really have to fight the temptation to use very bad language. Somehow they have an A+ rating with the BBB even with thousands of negative and similar reviews. How could they make things better? I don't know how hard is it to pull up to an address and knock on a door especially with today's technology? How hard is it to be respectful and not lie? They are untouchable and do not care, they know there are no consequences that is why they continue this behavior. We live in a land of laws millions of laws but laws that protect big corporations and government and leave us peons to their mercy."
"Just awful, four days to collect parcel, collected parcel without apology, one week later says it is being returned. Still not had it yet. Avoid at all costs. I will never use again. terrible service and rude on the phone"
"I ordered some parts for my Buick earlier in the week, I then received an email saying it would be delivered Friday and a signature is required. That's a real pain! But I need the parts so I arrange things so I can sit at the house until it's delivered. Can't go to the shop, can't go to the store. I looked at my email this morning and a UPS email says my package will be delivered today (Thursday). So I change things around again and sit. About 3:30 I start wondering how much more of my day do I have to waste? Look online and fill in the tracking number. It says it'll be delivered TOMORROW! I try calling two UPS ""customer service"" numbers and can only get a robot. I give the tracking number and both times they tell me there's a problem with your shipment. Okay I ask for a representative for details. Both times I'm told they can't connect me, look online. Some of the worst customer service!"
"The WORSE delivery company EVER. My question is, why are they in that business? They are not focused at all down there. You have to wait 3 weeks almost for local deliveries. UNBELIEVABLE. I had no control of who delivered my package this order. It was the company. Oh my tho, they are Terrible. Not one good rating for UPS. How hard can it be to deliver a package on time? That is what your whole job entails. I WILL never use UPS in the future and will ask the company i am shopping at, which shipper they use before I place my order."
"Says a package was delivered, and it is no where to be found. I have tried calling several times, and I’m denied to speak with a representative. I’m also unable to file a claim no matter how many times I try to do so."
"If you are sending something, Please do the recipient a favor and do NOT use UPS! Their customer service is by far the most frustrating thing you will ever deal with! The 3 times I've had to use them, they lost a package that was supposed to be next day delivery, and the other two times, you have to chase down the delivery driver because they will leave a sticker on your door but not the package. Good luck using their 800 number... They will not help you at all!"
"Found a missed delivery notice on my door. I followed the directions in the notice by going online and inputting the InfoNotice #. The site did not recognize the number. Tried again. No go. Called the 1-800 number on the notice. The automated system also did not recognize the InfoNotice #. Finally got through to an actual human who told me the Info Notice # contained no information that helps them identify you or your package. With my address they eventually figured out a tracking number and I was then redirected to someone else to take my payment for the outstanding fees. He told me how much it was. I noticed it was about $7 more than on the website. He told me that was a charge for making a payment with his assistance. I explained the only reason I needed his assistance was that the online system did not recognize the InfoNotice #. Didn’t matter. Even though I was forced to run this gauntlet of bad customer service, UPS was still determined to take another $7 from me. 45 minutes of my life gone due to their own poor system and they want more. I hung up and went online with the tracking number I’d been given and made the payment without the extra charge. I hasten to add the fellow I spoke with was polite and professional. Just doing his job."
"Gosh I am REALLY going to have to try hard not to use bad language. A complete bunch of incompetents .
Been trying to use the App. It asks for a email address and an ID
I can’t remember so I tell them so . The response is to offer you a ID and email address reminder . How do you get that ?
By signing in using, wait for it , your ID and email address . I hate this rubbish so called technology that simply is not fit for purpose."
"I was out of the country for a few months, when i came back i had a pile of UPS letters, more than 20.

apparently for something i ordered prior, i had to pay import costs.
trying to get a hold of customer service a few times now during my breaks at work.
today i was almost an hour on hold without any result!
Thanks Ups for ruining my breaks and phone bill will be high because of this!!!!
AVOID UPS!!!!!!"
Ups driver was so rude even after I said thank you to them for opening the door. He continued to say “not even a thank u?!” And I simply responded back “I literally said thank you”
"Air freight was holding at depot for over two months, sender / receiver was not contacted at very beginning, regarding the commercial invoice was needed until I tracked online, then notified the sender and invoice sent to origin branch, it has been two months since then, no one from UPS contact sender or received regarding any issue but parcel was holding until I tracked it a week ago, re sent the invoice and was told goods' been released on 18th, called 4 / 5 times, confirmed delivery would be on 28th."
"I wish I can put 0stars, UPS doesn’t deserve any star at all , until they learn the importance of customers time, they rush to return the order as a first and only solution, they have no flexibility, no ability to give solutions, they are returning the packages with a careless attitude"
Ups driver WENT WRONG WAY ON A ONE WAY STREET INSIDE A COMMUNITY EVEN WITH SIGNS!!! ALMOST COLLIDED WITH ME HEAD ON! I have video proof.
UPS makes it almost impossible to talk to a real person. One way to get around it is to tell the automated response that you are returning a call
"It’s almost impossible to get a live agent on the phone. A delivery driver drove over another package in my yard. I filed a claim, it was mishandled and I had to call back 3 times. Then a local supervisor came to my house and told me there was doubt about my claim, he said the driver had a perfect record, he followed that up with a statement that if my claim was approved then I’d be responsible for getting the driver fired. Awful. I won’t even order from companies that use UPS anymore. Absolutely terrible customer service."
I was unable to a live customer service representative. The automated service did not understand the tracking number and hung up. Live chat thought I wanted to change my address. UPS verified my package delivered but I didn't receive it. Drivers have delivered to the wrong address before. Recently a neighbor brought me a package that had been mistakenly delivered to their home. Shame on UPS for their poor customer service
"UPS always gives excellent service. There was a misunderstanding with the delivery date of my package and Kyrie went above and beyond to get me the information I needed. Also, Flynn called me in the afternoon with an update, Thank you so much."
"Need to pay customs? We won't tell you!
Expecting a package, tracking it shows it's in their local warehouse in my country, there it sits without a word for several days, before suddenly returned to sender. Myself and sender both contact UPS, they then claim I declined to pay customs... I was never contacted, I pretty much knew I would have to pay, but it's hard to pay when you don't tell me how much and where/how to pay... I guess I'm the fool for trusting you to do the bare minimum?"
"Ordered a package through Amazon on April 5th. Package shipped on April 6th stopped receiving updates on April 10th. It is now April 26th as of the date of this review and no.package, UPS said they can not track it. Useless!!"
"I wish I didn’t have to give them a star. They don’t deserve a star. They customer service is rude. Policy is crazy. They lose your package and can’t find it. They basically want you to take a loss or only want to give you $100 when you pay more for your items I get a call from someone yesterday he didn’t tell me his name he called me from his cell phone number, I asked to speak to the legal team he told me he can’t speak to me no more and hung up in my face that was rude. At this point I don’t know who to speak to. I’ve been actions to speak to the legal team no one wants to give me no number or transfer me over to who I need to speak to so it looks like I am going to have to take a loss"
I used FedEx to send documents to Winnipeg in Canada from the UK. They arrived in just over 24hrs. My family sent the paperwork back the same day it arrived via UPS - took 4 1/2 days! Appalling service and I won’t use them again. They got the post code wrong and I had to phone and email the shop in Canada to rectify that then I asked for the package to be delivered one day later as I knew I would be out. Sat in all day and they never showed. I cld track where it was but just wasn’t moving - finally the day after it should have arrived I was able to speak to someone who was very pleasant but all they cld say was that the package would arrive by 7pm that day. Fortunately it finally arrived before I had to go out. Never will I use UPS and have told my family in Canada to avoid them.
"The absolute worst app, website, and automated phone service I have ever seen. Tell me why 2 hours of just trying to change my delivery options is needed? And I STILL couldn't do it."
"Driver is seen on camera walking up to door and putting an attempted delivery sticker for another apt., but no sticker for me, and doesn't even buzz my apt - I've been here all day waiting and available. So strange that they get to the door but they don't even try to deliver anything! This was already delayed and I am flying out early tomorrow for a wedding and I was supposed to have this jacket delivered days ago. The rep on the phone was friendly but going forward, I will actively seek another courier. This happens way too often - the drivers just flat out lie."
This is the 2nd time that I have to chase my package because the drive is lying about him trying to deliver it to me. Taking to days off to recive deliver at it never been deliver to me. Now I have to drive to get it. It drive need to be fire for lying to me and the company.
"The UPS driver consistently does not stop at the house to deliver the packages. Instead, they take it to an auto parts store that they have a relationship with to hold packages. Multiple of my packages have magically vanished from this place, causing real headaches.

There is no reason for the driver to not stop at my house. I get packages from the other delivery services, and often also from UPS, but about 30% of the packages are just routed to this black hole, sometimes to never be seen again. Not to mention having to drive across town and wait in line while an auto technician looks for a package in their parts warehouse.

I now do everything I can to avoid deliveries by UPS, even paying vendors extra to send packages by FedEx or USPS.

UPS is terrible."
"4 days delay on original delivery date.

UPS Mexico does not answer the phone (busy tone)
UPS US Phone support IVR is absolutely terrible: hangs on you telling you it is impossible to connect you to a representative....."
"Apalling service, delays after delays after delays, but apparantly only the last 1 business day delay counted so they wouldn't offer a refund. Never using UPS again, I thought Yodel was bad, congratulations Yodel you are no longer the worst delivery company."
"This morning I encountered what it’s like to do business with a UPS Truck an inch off my bumper truck number 173406 at 07 20 this morning April 25, 2023 on the corner of East Greg and Franklin way. The driver politely passed me and started hanging his finger out the window, shouting cuss words, if this was my driver, he would not work for me very long and if this driver gets into an accident, I will be there to testify against him. I’m going to follow up on this and find out who he is. I’m sure he runs this route every day I’m going to start videotaping his aggressiveness. You might want to take care of this."
"I have been waiting for my package over 2 weeks
Everyday the track tells me that It will be delivered by the end of the day and still not delivered."
"This company has one of the dumbest business practices I've ever seen.
My package ended up running ahead of schedule so ups tried to deliver while I wasn't home.
They also won't allow me to pick up my package myself.
In order to change the delivery date to save them the time and money of driving out to my house every day when I'm not going to be there, they want to charge me 9.99."
"Spent over an hour on the phone with at least 5 people, 3 of them transferred me right back to the same customer service line. Last person put me on hold and never returned. Customer service is basically non-existent, all the agents can do is look up tracking. You will receive no help whatsoever. UPS rounds up or down your payment on your shipping receipts. They put incorrect payment amounts on their own receipts. Worst customer service people and service I have ever experienced, a real shame."
My packaged was delivered to wong address..was told it was put on wrong truck and they cant pick it up today that it will be tomorrow and then has to be reprocessed and be delivered on next business day...wth🤬they CANT read the address on the package?????They should reimburse my shipping fee'S??? WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!
"UPS is the worst, the whole company a hot ass mess, the drive lied and said they came to my house and I wasn’t home when in fact I was home waiting on their lying ass, called the office and was told my package would be delivered to me with 2 to 3 hours and they would call me back to confirm but they lied again still waiting on my package, this company really needs to do better and do the job they signed up for.. Just shut down at this point because you all as a company suck and I hate that for you guys.."
"Yes, we would like our UPS driver put back on our route in Mount Morris New York. His name is Kevin McCarthy. We liked him when he was on our route and we would like him back on our route. I understand that y’all bid for your routes. But we would like our driver back on our route please."
"As a living and rational being, I can NEVER walk into a UPS office for any courier service whatsoever. The only reason that I am currently at their mercy is because of VFS Global.

VFS Global (Nigeria) has partnered with them to inflict utmost pain, anger, and sorrow to their customers. I paid for Express 1-day delivery service to VFS Global with regard to the delivery of my important travel/visa documents. However, little did I know that VFS Global and UPS are both partners in crime whom request for exorbitant fees from their customers; and yet offer the most annoying, frustrating, terrible, and spiteful delivery service and customer service.

It has been 8days and still counting, and I have NOT yet received my travel documents which I did pay for a 1-day (Express) delivery service locally within Nigeria. In fact, I have begun a legal suit against them; and they MUST certainly pay for the damages they have caused to my health, business, and all my travel plans.

UPS only excels in NEGATIVITY!! Bunch of thieves and arrogant individuals."
You know your company is dog water when Carrier Pigeon seems like a more viable option.
Package sat in Jacksonville for 3 days before being transferred to USPS to finish the delivery. UPS can't even finish the job let alone do it in a timely fashion. Over a week to ship. 3 days without any tracking updates and then transferred hands so they don't even have to do the job. Always some bs with UPS.
"They claim to be unable to deliver the package, but have not tried calling or ringing the door bell. This is not the first time."
"I’m so sick and tired of UPS, they can’t even deliver poop to a toilet, without RESCHEDULING. This company is a joke. In two months I had four deliveries “rescheduled”. How sh@$ty of a company do you have to be that the USPS is more reliable???? STOP RESCHEDULING DELIVERIES AND DELIVER PACKAGES WHEN YOUR SUPPOSE TO!!!!!"
Never got my package received ups says it got delivered and picked up but i went to the local post office and they didn't find the package such a shame from this company would never ship through them ever again... just lost 30 usd for a package that never came through
"Terible delivery . Supposed to deliver on saturday . Then day before delivery sent message saying will deliver on friday. Of course i was at work. Then when called on saturday as item needed for saturday they said will deliver next week maybe momday. When asked to collect as desperate said no, they said my fault as i wasnt home on friday . Explained they sent initial ilemail that on saturday and for week order was showing still will deliver on saturday . Ordered via amazon but they used ups. Vv. Unhappy. They put me to speak with manager and waited 1h on line before put phone down"
Ups count yall fukingg days. Horrible service. Dumb ass customer service agents and slow ass mangers. They just a big ass rip off cus u will never receive your package in time
"UPS is definitely trash. Throw the whole company into the trash bin because that is where it belongs. They lost my package per usual. The claims process to get a refund is hell because their site is very glitchy. Once I finally got to the part where you upload a receipt of your order, it just kept spinning. Then I went on their Facebook page and they deleted my comment about their service. Overall just poor service and the delivery people are also incompetent; lacking common sense and an iota of intelligence."
"Poor customer service, they do not offer enough delivery options and won't comply with delivery changes that are accepted by them. Mediocre attention to detail and archaic business hours. Would go with Fedex or DHL any day of the week."
"A absolute joke of a company, I will pay more from a company that doesn’t use these clowns just to make sure I don’t have an issue. I order a full exhaust system for my truck, waited and watched till the arrival date has passed a month later. I reported a claim with UPS who then started their “investigation”. First they said that I had already received it when I hadn’t as well as the shipping updates clearly stated it had not even gotten close to me. I went back and forth 12 times within the first 2 months of the claim being opened where they were looking for a box that should be probably 4 feet long and 2 feet tall at least… I didn’t hear anything for another week so I sent another email where they then again stated the case was closed as the product had been found and delivered… again no such luck as I didn’t have the product and the tracking information hadn’t been changed anymore. During this time I just made a PayPal claim in which I ended up winning and getting my money back from them. after the refund had been issued I revived a call from a UPS saying they found my package but they needed me to give them the serial number off the box, the colour and description of the box and what all the pieces in the box were…. Which how would I know if I hadn’t got it! the person on the other end of the phone couldn’t make sense of how I didn’t know what it looked like after explaining multiple times I am the one supposed to be getting the package not the one sending it so I hung up and the poor company that used UPS will never get my business as long as they shop with them as well as probably are out the money now too. Then to top it all off I order of all things a code book for my trade and picked the expedited 3 day shipping not looking who it was shipping with and sure enough these clowns and now it has been 7 and it doesn’t have a expected delivery date…. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!"
"I ordered my first Nike Dunk! I customized the shoe, waited for the shoe only to have ups deliver to the wrong address. Unfortunately we live in a society nowadays where people don’t or won’t return or drop off packages to the right person even if you’re their neighbor. Thanks Ups for nothing can’t even get the shoe replaced!"
"Horrible experience! I shipped a 401 k rollover check through UPS. I realized they lost my check 10 days later. Tried following up for another couple of weeks. They told me the check was lost and I needed to file a claim. Meanwhile I had to cancel the check and ask my old 401 k provider to issue a new one. UPS made me run in circles between the store and their customer service to resolve the claim I filed. I visited the store at least 4 times. And called and emailed their customer service a couple of times each. 15 days after the check was reported as lost, UPS found and delivered the now cancelled check. Which created more issues for me with my new 401 k provider who deposited it and then had to revert the payment. I am still sorting out this issue. However, UPS at their end, very casually closed my claim with no resolution.
They didnt even pay me pack the shipping charges they charged me for a package they lost. Let alone reimbursing me for the trips to their store and the trouble they put me through cancelling and re-issuing checks."
"Still waiting on the same package for 2 weeks. Has had to have the shipper send the package 4 different times with special instructions due to my disability but UPS refuses to leave it at my door like they have been asked to do several times. So now I will have to make special arrangements to get to a drop off point, THANKS UPS..."
"I found out something this week that left a true distaste in my mouth for UPS as a whole. This has nothing to do with the packages, delivery or drivers - it's with the company itself and their protocol. Once a UPS driver has completed their long tedious shift of delivering over 100-200 heavy packages per day - like a regular employee anywhere else, they would like to go home and rest or be with their family. However, I found out that UPS makes the drivers that finish their load early go help those other drivers that are seemingly not up to par or milking the clock. This could mean taking another 30-60+ more stops (100+ packages or more) off of another driver that doesn't want to work as hard. So instead of rewarding the employee that completed their job in a timely manner by letting them go home as their work for the day has been completed, they are FORCING those that work hard to help those that don't. This means that the hard working driver(s) have to work an extra 3-4 hours per day. The grueling job takes a toll on the UPS drivers bodies on a regular work day - and God help the ones working even extra hard to accommodate those that don't. In any other company that I've known - the reward goes to the hard workers, not the lazy bums. The slower drivers that milk the clock should have to complete their own shift themselves. I find it unreal that whoever is drafting this protocol wouldn't realize what a bad idea this is. This concept completely ruins any good employees work ethic and morale - and now ruins my taste for them as a company."
UPS is constantly delivering my packages to me days after they're supposed to be delivered. I don't know why it's so difficult to get a package where it's supposed to go on time when I pay for expedited shipping.
Horrible and lying company. Always “messes up” on tracking to cover over other mistakes.
"Not bad but not good either but it isn't as bad as some may think.

Great delivery sometimes it updates randomly time but it isn't bad. Recommend if timing isn't everything lol."
What can brown do for me? Let's start by delivering my package on time. Second is not delaying the delivery by 3 days because they forgot to put it on a truck when it's 3 cities away. Lastly you can go bankrupt
"Absoluletely the worst shipping company that i've know. The scans and tracking are outdated by days, your package is casually delayed several days, without informing you. No video, no photo evidence, the courier fill out the paperwork instead of you and they lie that is was me who did that. They fcked up delivering my $2000 package 3 times. And i haven't even received it yet!! They basically ship your package around their facilities and they expect you to pay them multiple times for this bullshít 'service'."
crap Kamil Janowski this is lying driver does not arrive with the shipment only means that there was an attempt to deliver why this little tw..still working
"The customer service call is super useless. Strong accents with rude voice, it is not helpful at all."
"This company could improve by:
a. providing a proper tracking service, that is, give a time slot when they will deliver.
b. Getting their courier to actually attempt a delivery and not pretend to do so.
c. Contact DHL or DPD and ask themn how to run a delivery service.

UPS is an appallingly operated company and The Vanguard Group should be ashamed of their service."
"As always, a disappointment. scheduled delivery on 20th, received emails and notifications to stay home. Day passes by, calling the next day to see what is happening. Lady tells me that parcel arrived at my country warehouse on 14th and haven’t been scanned since then… very useful CRM and tracking system, whatever they use, what can I say, It’s 2023 guys!!! Received an email to fill in an eye watering excel to start an investigation, are you guys for real??? Please go bankrupt"
"Worst delivery company. They lie. They claim to initiate contact, and they do no such thing. They sit on items. Then suddenly, they disappear. They don't answer their phones or emails. I have had lawyers chasing them for weeks and my lawyers say they have never seen anything like it."
SENT A IOSS PACKAGE EXPRESS SAVER WHERE TAXES WERE PAID TO AMAZON BUT THE IMBECILES AT UPS CUSTOMS DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY AND TRIED TO CHARGE OUR CUSTOMER TAXES. ALSO THEY FAILED TO DELIVER NEXT DAY AND TOO TOOK MORE THAN 3 DAYS. THE THIEVES WILL NOW CHARGE US TO HAVE THE PACKAGE RETURNED AND ALSO WILL NOT REFUND THE SENDING COST AND BRUSH IT OFF BY SAYING 'IT'S A CUSTOMS PROBLEM'
"Renders a very poor courier services without any cystomer care response as parcel, which should take 24 hours to be delivered are never dispatched even after 36 hours (still without any response to calls, emails or compliants). Usually in partnership with VFS Global in Nigeria will charge exhorbitantly for poor delivery services!"
I purchased a fan from Costo that was shipped via UPS. The UPS driver stole my package. I am working remotely and was home all day when apparently a UPS delivery driver said he delivered my package. They did not even ring the video doorbell and there is no video record of them delivering the package. What a shame?
"UPS has a really terrible service and customer service. Rude, insensitive and unprofessional staffs."
"I dropped off some shoes to send to my son that he was really excited about getting them. So was I bc I knew he would LOVE them! UPS Lansing,Mi UPS lost my package completely! It's 10 days later and I still can't get an answer I definitely wouldn't recommend. They gave me a receipt with a tracking number and I looked up that tracking number and it says package still waiting to be sent into mail when I the receipt says it says that they shipped it the same day. I they say they shipped it on April 10th and now it's April 18th. They still don't know where it's at. I could rate zero stars I cold!"
Good service
"This is so painful not receiving my package literally is giving me a mental break down I have such an important trip on the 21st and these people decide not to deliver my package their delivery driver decide to steal my package, but the person is claiming my package was delivered when it was not I cannot believe I asked them for a picture to prove that the package was delivered, but they could not present that to me."
"I paid $20 extra for the fastest possible shipping for some antibiotics for my dog, who has a urinary tract infection. Last night and today (up until around 2:30pm) the website said my package would ""arrive 11:45-2:45 today"", but then suddenly it changed to delivery TOMORROW. No real way to contact any kind of ""customer service"", so that's it. Meanwhile my dog suffers, and I get to keep that mop handy. Yet they wonder why people sometimes beat the crap out of their drivers. Me? Non-violent, but I AM tempted to wait until their driver is in my yard, then let my dog (80 pound German Shepherd) out . ""Ooops""! See, I can make mistakes, TOO.
No consequences, no PROGRESS."
The only reason I am leaving one star is because I can't leave zero. My UPS delivery driver is absolutely horrible he decides to leave my packages wherever he pleases instead of the exact location he is supposed to. My mailbox is a mile from my house on a main road he decides it's appropriate to leave my packages on the ground in front of my mailbox where anybody driving by can stop and pick it up or go through it . I have had two packages open by the time I pick them up luckily nothing was taken . I call and make complaints and nothing gets done he still continues to leave my packages wherever he pleases. This also goes to speak to the management who refuses to correct the problem. Their suggestion is to try the UPS my choice so I tried that and of course there's something wrong with their site and it will not let me pick where my packages are to be sent which I shouldn't have to pick because he's delivered packages to my house before he's just being a lazy sack of s*** and doesn't want to do his job. Their tech support is incompetent and can't help me fix the problem on the My Choice website UPS is nothing but a joke and I honestly don't understand how they are still the most popular shipping company in the world somebody needs to step up to the plate and knock these guys out of business because UPS sucks.
"Opdates from UPS:
-we have changed your delivery to a pickuppoint
- package out for delivery
- Failed delivery attemt - recipient was not avalable (its an open store)

Dident even try to deliver the package"
"Had a parcel sent to me through Parcel2Go they used UPS as there courier, they attempted delivery and left a calling card with no information on, the unique 8 digit code on the card was unrecognised and customer services put the phone down on me twice."
"Unfortunately everytime I have ordered a product and UPS Sure Post is the delivery source, it is NEVER on time and always screwed up in some way. I have called UPS customer service and they are absolutely no help other than to state my package is still in transit.
For example, my package left Portland OR on April 17th, arrived Denver CO on April 19th which is where it should be delivered. UPS Tracking then states it arrived back in Portland OR on April 19th. Instead of delivery to me on the 20th, maybe the 22nd? Certainly going to have to ask sellers what service they use, as you get what you pay for with UPS Sure Post."
"I ordered the express delivery 2/3 days. It was supposed to be delivered on Thursday or Friday. 13th or 14th of April. I was there all day both days. No one called me on Thursday, so I assumed the package (new phone) will be delivered on Friday for sure, so I left the door unlocked, in case I work with some power tools, and don't hear the knocking on the door at the shop. The tracking information showed that it will be delivered on Friday the 14th. To my surprise, nothing happened! I realized on Monday morning, they might be returning the product back. Called the customer service, and they said someone was there on Thursday, but no one was there. But, no worries, it will be redirected and you'll get it today at the end of the day, or tomorrow early morning. Tracking information showed too, that at the end of the day. At the end of the day it changed that it will come Wednesday at the end of the day.
Conclusion: Horrible service! Tracking info constantly changes, and can't be trusted. Workers are incapable to make a call. Called the customer service to get a refund, as the regular delivery was for free, and I am getting it even later than that. Not to mention all of the plans they destroyed! I had to cancel the trip because of one idiot delivery guy working for some idiot company. Customer service said that UPS doesn't give the work phones to they employees,as if it's any excuse. Every normal person nowadays has a phone with unlimited calls and texts, and at every order you are supposed to enter your phone number. Customer service wasn't even capable to issue the refund and asked me to do it myself online. All of their website also is user unfriendly.
Had to ship a package to Spain, and it took 3 hours to get it working. Even the guy at the UPS access point was totally confused and didn't know how to help. Almost lost a prepaid 100 euros due to that."
UPS always seem to do the job. I have never yet had a problem
"Three times my neighbours have found cards placed by UPS at the front door of our block, without trying to find me to deliver the goods to me.
On all three occasions that they claim to have called, I was actually in, and so was my flat-mate.
After the second time, I was promised a delivery on the following working day, in the evening. Again, they failed to turn up. Instead, I received yet another card, placed at the entry door, one day after the promised date!
The customer service advisor said that they did not have the correct address for me. How is it possible to then leave the card at the entrance of my block with my flat number on it?!!"
"They don't knock at your door to pick up an item, they just slap a sticker on your door stating you weren't there. Worst company and customer service. A monkey could do a better job!"
"They don't even deserve 1 star. It is rare that I actually have a pleasant experience. These people are some of the most incompetent beings I've dealt with. They can't follow basic directions. The drivers blatantly don't care. There's always an issue in delivery. I had to have my packages sent to a access point [good thing they have those or they would be totally useless] The drivers here wouldn't even attempt to deliver the packages. SO many times they have rang and immediately left. They dont even wait for u to get to the door which takes 1min or less.[Apt]
Just time after time incompetence.
I cancelled my amazon prime due to them using this ""service"" constantly now.
Just terrible."
3 orders in a month span. 1 went missing other 2 were empty or missing products. The shipper and myself have made 2 different claims 4 all together and almost 3 weeks later no resolution. You can commit a crime like theft and get away with it from UPS but if any normal citizens did that they have faced prosecution. Ive spoke with employees and managers and bo head way on any of its a constant run around with the same steps being taken every time with no resolution
"You know how the big names like UPS have this reputation for next-day delivery, incredible service and so on? Wrong.

Ordered from a retailer on 4 April. UPS turn up (apparently) on 6 April, knock so quietly nobody notices, then drop off the parcel at a pick-up point instead of trying again.

Contacted their customer service, asking them to redeliver. The usual apologies and they say they'll get it done. A week later, I ask where it is. ""Oh, we didn't actually tell anyone to do that."" More apologies and a promise they'll do it.

That was 4 days ago and it's STILL not moved. Now they're suggesting I spend my time filling in an investigation form. I have no idea why, since their own system says where the parcel is and they know what they have to do with it.

Stunningly incompetent, infuriating and all-round godawful pile of uselessness."
"In a nut shell OTHER DELIVERY SERVICES ARE FAR BETTER than UPS

“The receiver was not available for delivery. We'll make a second attempt the next business day. “

UPS kept delaying my package with this note, but they never called me even a single time. Online service is ridiculously poor, to claim the delay on top of it if I try it o change the delivery type it comes with a price for no fault of the customer. Today I have to print two white sheets with instructions to call me if they are unable to acces the front door which they kept claiming I’m not available where as I’m available at home all day."
"Waited in all day as estimated time of arrival was 09.30-1. Investigated online to find out package was still in Germany. After setting up account, wasting 20 minutes noting it’s an American company and would only accept US states not UK counties, to change delivery date found out could only do it once delivery had been tried…an absolute joke of an organisation with the worst customer journey in the planet…"
"UPS lost one of may package. My company replaced it for me and instead of my address I chose to pick it up in a local UPS Store. It was delivered on Friday and I went to pick it up today (Monday) at 3213 Duke St, Alexandria, VA 22314. The young rude guy asked me to pay $50 for the days they kept it - Wow. I was to ask the reason, and he took the package back without lessoning to me . . . Since I did not have any other option to rid of this poor business. I paid $5 for each day including weekend and leave. The worst experience. One package lost for another I paid more :)"
My package was open they took 6 items inside. And close it back with a tape. UpS just stole from me they not reliable at all
"Online service not user friendly. Telephone customer service v poor, I called 3 times nobody could help. Access points don't have printers, cannot find UPS centres easily. To top it all, for a 0.2kg parcel delivery within UK they charged £10 online and the driver came and charged £6.25 again calling it service charge!
1 star for a helpful caller from UPS who kindly agreed to print label.
Otherwise worth 0 stars"
"I have sent parcel 3 in the service 8 to 10 USA. The two parcel reached on after 15 days and other parcel still showing custome clearence shortly update the delivery date. I have check with the custom support they are saying that parcel last scan on dated 13 APR. After that they dont know where is parcel unable to track the same. Almost 20 days over nothing happen, It worst service. FEdex and DHL is the best service."
First of all most the time the Saturday delivery guy leaves all the packages in the lobby of an apartment building of 154. All items are always stolen. FedEx brings them to your door. I have had have 3 packages that day they have been delivered and they have not been. Filing a claim takes a month. This company doesn't even come close to FedEx service. FedEx service is great.
Lost parcel for months then when claimed for it suddenly found but delays all the way with missing documents and everything can think up. Never bring parcels to my delivery address.
UPS Drivers need to be retrained when it comes to customer satisfaction and delivering items that the customers pay for. I had a driver tell me he left one of my packages on his truck and he NEVER returned with my item even after I offered to go downstairs to return it so he didn’t have to come back. I spoke with several customer service representatives who refused to submit a complaint against the driver.
"I am writing this to inform you of what I consider a MAJOR problem in Pinellas County Florida.
For at least the last five years, UPS has come around in
The neighbor hoods in October to ask people to put a pod in their yards for the busy Christmas holidays. They promise to pay a pre determined amount of money.
The first 3 years they paid you half the money upfront and the rest in January.
The last two years have changed dramatically, Last year I did not receive my payment until March, and that is only because I went to their local office an complained.
This year as of April 16, and I still have not received my payment, along with hundreds of others.
I have went to their office twice, the first time on March 31st. I as told that they were aware of the problem and NO ONE has been payed. I asked for a number for corporate and after a few minutes the gave a number that they said was for billing, and that’s the only number they had. I called the number they gave me and I talked to person. He transferred me to his supervisor, talked to her, she transferred me to another person who said he would look into it.
One week later I returned to their location and talked to another person who also agreed no one has been payed. Asked for a number for corporate, she stated she did not have a number. I said I believe you all call everyday to corporate.
In conclusion I will not put a pod next year. My personal advise would not have anyone do it, but the final conclusion is up to each individual."
"I have a package coming and without signing into an account can’t get tracking information just expected delivery date. I have no need for another password, just wanted tracking updates. Poor service"
Customer service line Refuses to allow me to speak to anyone real. The automated IVR doesn’t address the issue I have. Just says “we will not connect you to a rep” and hangs up.
"I love shipping with my local ups store in Levittown NY! Super friendly (Kim, Matt, Marianne just to name a few of my favorite people there). I’ve been going to this same location for years and always quick, friendly and professional."
"My package has been delivered to a address that I did not provide , I've been on the phone numerous of times and I can't believe how they delivered to a address that I have not provided? I would expect better from a company like this ? Still awaiting feedback"
"Bought a breadmaker 2 weeks ago, it was supposed to be delivered by UPS, but I never received it, when I went to track the parcel on the web, it said the parcel has delivered 4 days ago at 5:40pm, I was at home at that time however never got called or buzzed, they even didn't leave a notice in my mailbox. What kind of delivery service is this!!!"
"I received an invoice for unpaid duty for an item that I did not order and did not receive. After phoning customer service numerous times and having no help whatsoever, they passed my details on to a debt collector who is now harassing me. They have no proof of delivery, have not showed me any proof of signature or photo of the delivery. I am at a loss what to do and have asked them to show me all documents they have. I am reporting them to the ICO for breach of GDPR. Disgusting and abhorrent treatment received from a company who has outsourced customer service so no one cares"
"Wow where to start. Sent a parcel and they tried to deliver it twice (both times when the receiver said he was in), then spent 5 weeks getting the parcel back to me. Three calls to customer service to get them to update the address for the return which apparently they just didnt bother to do. Then when it did get back to me it was smashed to pieces. Trying to get a refund has been an ordeal too with 5 emails so far and still not getting anywhere."
"The worst company and service. I bought a suitcase from North Face and payed Delivery Express and they didn’t send the item on time and also, they didn’t send me any email notifying the delay. When I asked about their responsibilities… nobody gave a response and solution"
I got a notary done was told that package would be to the destination on tuesday or wednesday here it is friday and the documents important are still in mississippi.
Ordered aviation tools. I paid for the fastest expensive delivery US to Canada. Standard and express are the same. Paid for prepaid duties and taxes. I get notifcation saying it's on the way but it's not. It's going to take 2 weeks to receive. What a scam haha. I've read the reviews and it looks like a strategy for quick cash-grab. UPS lowkey scamming.
I paid extra to have a gift delivered to Canada before Thursday. Found out through tracking that there was a brokerage fee. We paid it and they still didn't recieve the gift. The next day Ups tried to deliver it COD . So the recipient turned the delivery away. They wanted her to pay 40.00. I called the local UPS store and they said they were unable to help. I called the international number and they sent me back to local. After trying 4 times to reach a rep from the international number they told me it was their mistake. I told them because I paid extra and it was their mistake I want it delivered today. They rescheduled for Monday. I am so upset I could scream. I will never use them again .
"I ordered a product from a company using UPS as their carrier, shipment was from US to UK and it took 33 days to arrive even though I paid for UPS Worldwide Express Service which states on their website it would take 2-5 days to UK. Customer service kept giving false promises about delivery date which meant I was waiting at my address many times throughout the 33 days and each time no delivery was even attempted until the last day. Customer service / depot also falsely claimed on tracking that the package was damaged, falsely said I had moved address and changed the name on delivery address without my consent. Package was only finally delivered after emailing the Trustpilot contact address found on this website. Worst experience with a delivery company despite paying very high brokerage fees to them which were almost half the cost of the item."
"I was trying to return some empty toner cartridges, our small part in saving the planet. This garbage company told me it was going to be $17 to pick them up, even though they have a prepaid return label. SO glad my company uses FedEx (although they are not much better) for our shipping."
"Almost the anniversary of my lost package, still no words from ups. Didnt found it, no reimbursement, nothing. Worst worst worst!!!"
Ups sucks no delivery window. Horrible customer service
"The company received, packed, shipped and destroyed an expensive piece of equipment, and then tried to argue that they were not responsible for the loss because it had been ""improperly packaged"". When I explained they had packed it, they said I needed to provide proof. However, their website (where I was directed to go) refuses to allow me to upload any documents because I don't have an account number. Their Customer Service, who you have to fight their automated answering system to get to, and who only have English as a second language, are incompetent a complete waste of time. No one ever provided me a useful piece of information (after 14 separate calls), and constantly sought to deflect blame and send me through an endless chain of representatives who seem to have no connection to reality. UPS is not customer focused, and once they have your money are uninterested in taking responsibility for their damages and monetary injury. This is without questions the worst company I have ever dealt with - and won't get any more of my business....my advice is to avoid them at all costs."
"I have had at least three terrible experiences with UPS in the last 5 months. They are by far the worst delivery provider....Far worse than Fedex or USPS.
I have a UPS driver who doesn't want to deliver to our apt for whatever reason- he has to walk too far down the sidewalk or it is late in the day and he doesn't want to work anymore or he's just lazy....Who knows??
What he does is he indicates the package is undeliverable as no apt number was given. When I call customer service they verify apt number was listed and correct. This has happened several times and it's the same driver doing this. So I finally filed a formal complaint. A supervisor was supposed to get back to me about what they were going to do about him. No word yet. I hope he is fired. They pay these drivers well and laziness is no excuse. He has to deliver to other people in our complex, so I don't believe he has any excuse for his behavior. And I know they have a lot to do as I hear UPS drivers complain they are worked too hard. But that is your job. Get a different one then if you don't like it.
UPS is not cheap to use and we consumers expect better. I avoid them at all costs when I have a choice. But sometimes you don't have one."
Worst delivery ever. I was home all the time but the driver says that they didn’t get access to the building and returned the delivery. Now I have to wait 3 days for a re-delivery.
"Never in time, tracking shows false dates, totally awful. Do not pay even a cent to them!"
Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Scheduled a pickup for next day and they didnt show up for 4 days. Once they picked up my package they lost it. Claims took forever to get back had to call multple times. Woman in claims department so rude I dont know how she still has a job.
The worst delivery company in the world!!!!!!!
"The worst shipping company in the world. Staffed by completely incompetent people, AI will likely replace their entire customer service department very soon as reading from a script and hanging up the phone when a customer asks for a supervisor can be automated fairly easily."
"The worst delivery service provider. They emailed me saying ""they tried to deliver and you can pick your order from a collection point"".

Then I phoned them telling them they they lied and guy i spoke to on the phone said he arranged to deliver to the address next day. Waited all day and again they did not deliver.

If I knew in advance that New Balance uses them for delivery I would have not ordered from them. I know what kind of service UPS provides, and it is the worse of all delivery companies."
"They lost my passport, ruined my holiday. Gave me nightmares for 14 days, kept lied to me. Never never again!"
"This company just wants to SCAM people!
I had a scheduled pick-up and I was home the whole day. UPS did not ring my bell, and only dropped a sign saying I need to reschedule or dropped off my large package myself. OF COURSE, to reschedule I need to pay extra fee…
SCAMMERS!!"
"Laziest people in Barbados. They've been holding my parcel nearly two months. Extremely unprofessional and lazy attitude on the phone and in person. Awful.

I will not be using UPS again."
Very bad company
"I wish I could give them zero stars. It is a constant struggle to get a package from UPS, they're constantly knocking once then sprinting away, giving you no time to give them a signature if they need it. I genuinely hate ups and their poor delivery service."
Horrible customer service. Absolutely useless when it comes to international issues. Absurdly undertrained staff.
"The driver Cameron Bowman is the best driver we had ever had. Very respectful, professional, and helpful.
He deserves a raise."
"Terrible company, my wife sent me a diploma, they lost it, most likely delivered it to a different address. The problem is that I received my diploma at the university, which is now destroyed due to the war in Ukraine, my city is destroyed by the occupiers from the Russian Federation. When I asked what to do, the representatives of the company said to contact the sender. I wonder if they really think that my wife will send me a new diploma?"
Deliver arrived on time and the delivered item was in a very good condition. Ample amount of messages were sent confirming date and time of delivery.
Don’t trust UPS. I have sent the laptop but it got lost/ stolen. I can understand this could happens but customer service and other teams were lying to me for two months that everything is ok. They also pretended to be a manager/ supervisor when I wanted to speak to them. Finally when o got connected with investigation team they said it’s lost and I managers never spoken to me. I only got refund for delivery not for the laptop because I had no receipt for it.
I waited for a package that I bought at t mobile and the delivery was delayed. I called and all the support people told me a different answer. In the end my package was lost and I never got any response
"In August of 2022, I shipped an espresso machine for warranty work and had my local UPS store pack it. I purchased $2500 insurance, and learned that it was damaged enroute. The local store told me I had to file my claim with UPS, which did not have an option to do so and told me to file my claim with the local store. The owner told me he had submitted it, but kept saying corporate had to fill the claim. He even told me I would be paid the full $2500 because he packed it himself and it was damaged. Eventually, after waiting for months, I filed a consumer complaint with the attorney general of Arkansas, and was contacted by corporate saying they would help me resolve it but I had to talk to the local store. As of April 2023, I have not received any payment and they continue to tell me that I need to talk to the other. The local store owner told me he had one claim that has been waiting for them for over six months with no word."
"Over the top so complicated,i only wanted to alter a delivery,gave up in the end."
"I had a valuable UPS handled shipment that required a signature. I was initially given a delivery date, but the delivery didn't happen. I contacted UPS Customer service about this, and they could not give me the disposition, delivery date, or location of my package. I was told a Dispatcher would contact me, but no one ever did. I only hope I eventually get my package.
I will never use UPS again."
Pathetic when it comes to delivery. The parcel has been delayed due to timing issue for 3 days in a row. You can’t escalate
"No tracking emails, if you want to know where your package is, you must find the tracking number through the shop you ordered from.
I just refreshed the tracking for two packages that were originally coming tomorrow (April 12th) to learn that they might send the packages back because the address is incorrect - all that while I'm at home and not even a phone call to double check."
They lost my package... then denied losing it. And that I have it.... like what a crock of..... worst service ever... like why is this still an option. You have a better chance of a carrier pigeon delivery your piano sized package... be smart don't use ups.
"I dropped a package in a UPS drop box. It's vanished. And because I have no tracking number, the automated AI that controls the customer service number will not connect me an agent.
So, essentially, my package is lost and I have to pay for the item.
I'll never use UPS again for anything."
Don’t even deserve one star very bad service for delivery… Didnt delivered my parcel on the expected date
"UPS STEAL YOUR ITEMS AND DELIVER ONLY WHAT HAS NO VALUE TO THEM.
I left my earphones and retainers at my friend's apartment in NYC, so they kindly sent them to me in LA. The UPS team opened the package, stole the earphones, barely tapped it back together and delivered only the retainers. These people are evil and do not have any human regard for others!
DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! They will rob you!"
"Hard to even give it one star. Worst service I have ever received. I paid $109.00 to have something overnighter. They lost the pkg. ""sorted wrong"". I spent all day trying to find out where it was. A supervisor said she located it and said she would call back in 1 hour and I could pick it up. No one ever called. They are Liars. I called someone else they said it was on a truck. No it was not. I called someone and they said they would call dispatch. Got a call from dispatch the call had been sent to wrong state. Was given a number to call and called over 25 times no answer and no returned call. They totally cost me thousands of dollars and screwed up everything I had going. The most unprofessional and dishonest company I have ever dealt with. I hope their happy they totally screwed me over."
"WELL MY PACKAGE HAS BEEN OUT FOR DELIVERY 3 DAYS IN A ROW WAS NEVER DELIVERED.TRIED CHATTING WITH UPS THEY REFUSED MY REQUEST.HAD TO FINALLY FILE A CLAIM FOUR DAYS AFTER UPS TRACKER SAID PACKAGE WAS OUT FOR DELIVERY KEEP SAYING BAD WEATHER.CHECKED WITH NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WEDNESDAY,THURSDAY,FRIDAY RAIN ONLY ON TWO DAYS"
"I have always had a great experience at the individual stores - this review is for corporate, more specifically their Claims Department.

I had a package arrive broken - it happens, which is why there is insurance. However I filed a claim on the package, took about an hour to take photos, send measurements, etc. The claims for says they will resolve with 15 days....it had been 30 days and still haven't heard anything. I followed up and 30 more days later still no response.

UPS please fix this process."
"Dreadful Company - no retailer should use them.

Ordered something from Outlet. They use UPS. I will not order with them again because UPS is so bad.

I had to stay in all day as there is no option to waive signature (as there is with better companies, DHL for instance) nor is there any indication of the time. Just 'by end of day'. That went out in the nineties.

Returning the item was even worse. Dropped it off at a UPS point - crappy shop in Malvern on Bellevue Terrace. The guy behind the counter struggled with English, took my mobile number and I never got an acknowledgement that the parcel had been received by the shop.

Went back the next day and was told by another person that he was new and untrained, but more to the UPS point, he didn't have the app installed on his mobile phone. UPS don't provide a separate handset (Evri do apparently) but expect the staff/drop off point to use their own hardware.

Disgraceful (and disgraceful of the shop owner not to train their staff - apparently a lot of people go back to say that they've not received an acknowledgement).

I will be letting the Outnet know I'll never order from them again."
"I have absolutely no idea what is going on with my package...

It was supposed to be here at 04-04-2023.... apparently, my package got a ""Anmodning om adresseændring"" basically telling me that someone or something has requested an address change... I never did that...

So now I don't know what address or anything my package is going...

Update: They finally arrived with my package 10 days after the original date, and they actually put the package somewhere safe for me to get... That's nice ill give them 3 stars for that the whole service reevaluated."
They asked me to pay 60€ issuing an invoice when I already paid for the label. Absolutely a shame. They also lost 2/2 Amazon packages. Absolutely a shame.
Better than DHL but worse than FedEx or others. I try to avoid using them when possible.
"Every time I get anything delievered through UPS it arrives late. The box always comes beaten and just in terrible shape. The worst delivery service, this is why Amazon is the way to go. F UPS"
"I called this UPS 1st and found out what time they close.
I got their address and it's on Maryland Parkway and Flamingo in Las Vegas, NV.

Then I asked if I could CERTIFY A LETTER I WANTED THEM TO MAIL. They said yes and it will be between $13-$20.
I said, I am coming today to certify mail my letter and she responded okay and once again we close at 5PM today.

Planning to catch the bus, I walked to the bus stopped and missed my bus. I waited in the heat for another bus. I had two buses to take.

Finally I reached Flamingo and Maryland Parkway I had to walk through the large parking lot and had 8 minutes left.
I called again to make sure they were still open and they said yes.

I reached the door on time, I said I am here to Certify Mail a letter and I called and then the lady said our system is down, we can't certify anything today!


OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!
I felt like calling them every single word they would have deserved!!!

I WASTED MY SATURDAY OVER THESE INCONSIDERATE PEOPLE. (clean version)
Their selfishness and poor customer service is exactly WHY THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WHEN I CALLED AND INQUIRED ABOUT IT. They didn't feel the need to share over the phone, that the system was down!!! That's POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

That would saved me a lot of pain. My back always hurt but I needed to mail this letter. Oh my goodness... NEVER AGAIN!

I AM TIRED, HOT, NOT IN A POSITION TO BE DOING ALL OF THIS WALKING DUE TO SCIATICA, THE PAIN IT CAUSES AND AN ISSUE IT HAS CAUSED TO ONE FOOT. Says I did to much trying to get there.
The fact that I called TWICE before getting down there, is why I am angry.

I WASTED AN 1.5 HOUR OF MY TIME AND MONEY TAKING BUSES WHEN THESE IGNORANT people, COULD HAVE PAUSED ON THE GOSSIP AND DID 1 MINUTE OF THEIR JOB!

I am so mad, I am now putting in a complaint online with BBB and I will NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE EVER AGAIN...IT'S TOO GHETTO AND RUN BY KARENS.

They knew the system was down! They've been open all day! HOW COULD THEY NOT KNOW???

I am very sure these KARENS kept that a little secret as a joke.
LETS JUST SEE IF I AM THE JOKE!

BECAUSE, I AM PHENOMENAL, AT FILING COMPLAINTS AND MINE HAS JUST STARTED...
I hope this stunt they pulled wasn't due to them racial profiling me or because I am AFRICAN.

I will be contacting the corporate office Monday morning with this FEEDBACK.

Had these UPS EMPLOYEES actually cared to share this information over the phone, I could have taken the bus to BETTER location with everything in working condition.

Because of them, my money is now delayed.
I need to certify mail something to receive money that is due to me and after this stunt with UPS, I can't go anywhere else until Next Saturday due to work.

DO NOT GO TO THIS UPS!!! IT'S FILLED WITH INCONSIDERATE HEATHENS..."
"I am in a rural area. I do not use FedEx or the Post Office because they are unreliable. I only use UPS for deliveries because the service is outstanding, and the drivers are wonderful. They go out of their way to get down my 1000 ft. driveway, which is sometimes covered in snow and ice, to deliver right to my door with a smile."
"Tries to charge you a bogus invoice. I ordered two packages from an ebay seller who mentioned he would pay the customs fee. I see receive the fees from UPS plus UPS asks for a late fee payment, and a payment for another invoice of a totally different person at a different address. What is going on!? I never agreed to this, avoid at all costs!"
Terrible delivering service. Didn't get my parcel for month and it was delivered in the wrong city
They have a reputation of arriving late or delay your package and it is so annoying. Honestly it is horrible
"$92 “brokerage fee.” Useless support, would not let me self clear because the package was “already past customs.”

0/10, screw UPS."
"Plz don’t trust on this company.., they are doing fraud… most cheater company in. The world"
7 DELAYS FOR ONE PACKAGE REALLY??? IT SHOWS OUT FOR DELIVERY 3 DAYS IN A ROW AND EACH DAY THEY DELAY IT. THE TRACKING WEBSITE LITERALLY SHOWS IN IN MY CITY FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS AND I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE TRUCKS IN MY FREAKING NEIGHBORHOOD ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE SERVICE!!
This driver is an a-hole. He leave large packages blocking our door so we cannot open it and does not follow our delivery instructions at all. Hr is also rude when we have to deal with him directly.
"They don't give you an option to get your package on the same day if you missed it by like 10 minutes, even if you are at home. Instead they make you wait days for your package, and all around it is a terrible experience. UPS needs to get its crap together, and give people the ability to get their packages when they want them."
Customer service is absolutely useless. What a shame this company has become so unhelpful. I will never ship anything through ups again.
"UPS is terrible as FedEx. They'll just drop a package n leave. They don't announce themselves.

They use to b good at one time. Not anymore!
I wish another company would take over."
"Horrible. I waited all day for an important business package because I received an email confirmation saying the package would arrive around 12 noon that day. At around 11:40 am I received another email saying that they had missed me and the package was being redirected to the pickup location. I NEVER received a knock on my door, nor did I receive a sticker or note on my door letting me know if an attempt to drop off. LIES!!! Absolutely RIDICULOUS!!! And don’t get me started on the hoops you have to jump through to file a complaint!!! If it were my choice, I would NEVER use their services."
"While I absolutely love our local UPS driver, the shipping center has messed up 2 orders for me in the last week. Both were to be overnight shipping with time sensitive chilled contents. One order arrived after 3 days, was warm and ruined. The next had a “mechanical error” and will arrive 4 days after being shipped. Within 16 hours of being shipped, it is within an hour drive of the recipient and none of the representatives (including a supervisor) can supposedly do anything about it. This is a blow to my professional reputation and I will NEVER use UPS again! This is extremely disappointing."
"Ups track is always late, people who currently working there saying delivery will be from 8-12 and calling them at 2 pm they telling me it’s might take 5 hours more, which considering I am going to stay home all day, like I have nothing to do with work, only wait for package to get a signed it! Terrible company! Never use it!"
"UPS is the worst. Compared to Amazon, Amazon is head and shoulders above them."
What a lossy company this is. My girlfriend got her laptop fixed at an Apple Store that is 2 hours away from us and they were supposed to deliver it back to us in 2 days. We live in an apartment complex on the third floor and UPS is supposed to have a key to get into the complex to drop off mail and deliveries. It’s been 6 days and we constantly keep getting the stupid slip saying that we made an attempt to deliver it or some bullcrap and delaying us getting the laptop back. I can’t tell you how many times we called customer service to somehow fix this problem but all we were getting was lies and different answers from different people from UPS. Telling us that Apple has restrictions with UPS even though when we contacted Apple about it they lifted those restrictions?? Then claiming they’ll call us back in an hour or a specific time when we never do receive one. Now telling us they’re shipping the package now back to Apple and we won’t get the package back till next month????? This is the worst company I’ve ever had an experience with and that’s saying a lot from me being very patient with this whole situation. UPS is a lossy garbage company.
"Zero stars!
Worst courier ever! Impossible to re direct a parcel online if not having a US address (spent hours trying to open an online account with them), managed to do it via telephone call in the end but the parcel never made it to the collection point!
Nobody seems to know what is going on.
Very primitive and disorganised company… absolute no no !"
"When something is guaranteed!!!!! to be here it's here with any other company Except UPS -
you can count on it to come in days after the event with Ups . thanks a lot!"
"The worse service ever. They lost my parcel twice and went back to the sender. Two months waiting and I never got it. Customer service was worse they don't give answers. I had to add a claim and request an investigation and the only notification I got by email is that the parcel was sent back to the sender because a disruption. DO NOY USE UPS courier services, if you don't want to have a bad experience."
"I went to UPS in APEX NC and was waited on by MASON. He was so efficient and kind I just had to drop a note. This was an excellent experience, compliments to your hiring system."
I wouldn’t recommend this company to my enemies Go FedEx 💪🏾
Ups has officially become the worse company in shipping companies and that is to say something. They always have some type of mechanical failure. Packages are always delayed and then spend 26 hours in Jacksonville from the time it arrived to the time it finally left without being touched and process (too long) and then arrived in rockledge fl at 2:52am in the morning and didn’t start getting processed until 6:50am and it’s now 12:15 and still being processed causing a delay in my package after I spent 42$ in shipping! This is ridiculous! Then when you try to call it takes forever to actually speak to someone since the automated voice doesn’t want to put you through to someone. Just a horrible customer service company. My package should have never been delayed and once again it’s delayed!
"Utter shambles.

Guy dumps my package off at a shop, without giving me any of the package details. I get charged for moms before delivery (fine). I pay that, and then a month or so later I get an invoice for UPS for the moms charge already paid.

This is the second time these clowns have done this. Last time I had to cc the CEO of the company in to my complaint email before they'd even respond.

In a world that contains *BRING*, UPS is still the worst delivery company I have ever dealt with."
"Customer service doesn't do anything, I can't get my package because for whatever reason they need a signature, they come when I'm not home.
I tried to change delivery online about 10 times but yhe website doesn't work, it keeps saying ""we're sorry technical difficulties "" . I ended up calling Customer service to change delivery and she said I need to go back online and do it myself even though I told her the website isn't working. Very frustrating! I'm not really sure why they even have Customer service if they do nothing.
Ups used to be a great company bit it's Terrible now. I keep having issues with my packages."
"overcharged customs, ups call centre a joke and dont speak english they just hang up on you

i would never use them again"
"I had printed out the labels for the parcel but the details were too small for the UPS collector (Agnes) to scan. AGNES went above and beyond to help me print a larger label off the phone. Her technical skills were far beyond mine! What a polite, efficient, helpful, patient employee you have UPS. She is definitely an asset to your company. THANK YOU AGNES. Sheila"
"i had never dealt with ups before, and i hope i never have to again. instead of delivering my package to my front porch, they delivered it to my upstairs neighbors. naturally, they ended up opening it assuming it was theirs. thankfully they gave it back to me, but it caused a great deal of undue stress because i assumed it was lost or stolen. i wouldn't even be so upset if their process to file a claim made sense. i bought my items from a site that sells secondhand stuff, how am i OR the seller supposed to know what the serial number is? i don't expect exemplary service, but what i do expect is due dilligence and they couldn't even be bothered to give me that."
"rubbish website, useless app .. but at least its expensive"
"Terrible customer service, packages come months late, you phone customer service and they keep giving the run around then have to yell for a manager then the package is still late, I've had wrong packages with the wrong name show up too"
"I ordered items 2nd day air so that I could finish a job 3 hours from home. I got the confirmation that my items had made it to the distribution center but wouldn't be processed till the next day. I couldn't even pick it up my self, because they refused to get it off the truck. So 2nd day air is actually 3 days and a maybe. I will now have to drive back to the job and have an upset customer."
"Terrible experience with UPS. My order was supposed to arrive within 2-3 days, but it ended up taking nearly two weeks to get here. When it finally did arrive, the box was damaged and my item was broken. I tried to contact their customer service for help, but was put on hold for over an hour and then disconnected."
"I try to avoid ups, the company should rebrand to opps. Yet again out for delivery for 12 hours, still waiting, maybe it will arrive, maybe not, who knows, certainly not ups. Ridiculous."
"I wish if something less than a one star .. not ever deserve this .. my package was sent through a leapord courier from Pakistan and then ups received it and sent my stuff in such an insecure and disrespectful manner that my bag worth more than £250 was all damaged having holes /tears in multiple sites , packages was removed from everything.. I understand that things go through custom check but there should be a way to keep thing back in a proper manner and not to waste someone hard earned money .. my brand new dresses thankfully were in complete sets but the way they were wrapped look like taking something out of the bin as they were some unworthy or dirty clothes and need to be discarded.. awful service will never recommend.. save your money ppl and don’t use this service 👎👎👎👎 👎"
"Utterly useless company. The info from the overseas call centre bears no resemblance to what is actually happening in the UK and there is no way to contact the UK Midlands hub (Tamworth) by phone. If it ain't arrived by 3pm the 'by the end of the day' info you receive online is just a lie to pacify you, it'll be next day if you're lucky."
"Terrible. Everything is terrible. Can't login because it doesnt recognize email addresses. I had 3 logins somehow. UPS ""My Choice"" only valid on one account so that was a giant mess unraveling. Customer support nonexistent robot chat. I had to google what ""shipment release authorized"" means because there is. No information on the website. I wish I could charge them hourly for wasting my time."
"Unbelievable level of incompetence. FUMING.

Wanted to return an item I had purchased through Desigual and was told ""next day returns - home collection - no printer needed...the courier will prepare the return label and will collect your package the following business day""

It has been 3 weeks. I have spoken to UPS customer services about 20 times, the depo about 5 times, Desigual about 5 times and wasted so many days waiting for them...

They don't email you or text you to let you know they are coming, and there is no way to contact the depo yourself to find out these things...

You just have to wait...and when they don't come, another call to customer services...they ""escalate it"" and then there is another excuse as to why the driver COULDN'T BE BOTHERED to do his job.

So many days wasted waiting...so many angry phone calls... finally someone came the other day and when I went to give him the package he said he didn't have the label (-which I had confirmed on every phone call to customer services, including that same morning that he was to bring) so...the package is STILL here...stressing me out.

Wasted more time getting someone from the depo to call me again, only to be told that they can't print out the label...I would have to call back Desigual (for the FIFTH label) and get a code for them at the depo!!!
I HAVE TO GET THE CODE FROM DESIGUAL, CALL BACK UPS CUSTOMER SERVICES, GET THEM TO SCHEDULE A PHONE CALL WITH THE DEPO AND THEN TELL THE DEPO WHERE IT IS GOING - like seriously?! Unreal. You wanna pay me to do YOUR job for you? Sat here for yet another day, waiting for the depo to call be for the 6th time. Crazy.

My advice: use DPD!"
"Another 1 star review. 92% of your reviews are 1 star. Duck(choice word) this company. I order from Sweden, they force you to have a signature and be present. Problem is I work mon through Friday till about 5:30. I asked if they could have it delivered after 5:30 since I will not be home. They say they cannot. My other option is a $6 fee to have it delivered to the station. Oh there and back is over an hour drive. I cannot have the signature waved on this package either. Zero customer service or understanding of people’s lives."
"Ups is crap and prices are insane, if you are considering taking a shipping service you better do it with another company otherwise you are signing for robbery"
"Horrendous service, no way to track a parcel stuck i. The same place for a week. No way of getting g the parcel back. No person available to talk to. Avoid avoid avoid"
"I've used UPS twice in the past few months. First, paid for ground service that was supposed to take 3 days. Package was finally delivered 2 weeks later. Now, paid for overnight shipping ($345!!!) and package experienced a ""operational issue"" and now has ""no timeline for delivery."" I needed the package at a conference I am at today. And am sure I will be flying out long before the package arrives. Never again UPS. Horrible experience every time."
"Package was tampered with and two items were stolen. I attempted to submit a claim online within the 60-day liability period. The system had a pop-up that said CANNOT SUBMIT CLAIM. For one week, I was contacting UPS via chat, phone calls, and talked to supervisors, only to be told, ""We're sorry, it's now more than 60 days and we cannot do anything about it."" Very unfairly treated as a long-time customer and UPS doesn't have any accountability for what happened. I would join a class action if there's one."
FCK YOU LATE PACKAGES ALWAYS GODDAM C()NTS
"Worst shipping company ever, don’t know how they’re still in business"
"I had a package shipped from Germany. The package arrived through customs on the 24th of March and ups got the package. Immediately they started sending me forms to fill out in regards to customs fees etc. No big deal. Got everything finished the hour I got the email. I wound up having to fill out each form 3 more times because they were either entering them wrong or telling me they were rejected. I never changed anything, and eventually started getting directions from them on exactly what they wanted on the forms and they were still rejected. Finally got that issue resolved after multiple hour plus long phone calls. Now the packages have moved to a ups facility and not shipped. Have called every day asking when they would be shipped and continue to get the same story ""they'll be on the way tomorrow."" It's now April 4th. Still haven't moved. The original purchase date was March the 4th. So I have a month into the shipment thus far. Dozens of emails, 8+ hours of phone calls, and my package still hasn't even moved. They suck, will never use them again."
"Best, best, best!!! Anyone looking for superb experience, don’t look any further. 3535 Peachtree rd, in bocktest is the BEST crew ever. Nobody comes even close.amazing office!!!!"
"Horrible customer service. Delivery delays. Stubborn, refuse to change delivery dates. Don't care about customers. Not surprised anymore why UPS have 1 stars reviews. Simply avoid.
Not recommending to friends and family members"
They do not follow their own time guidelines for delivery. Missing two days of work now. Sloppy business practices. Frustrating. Will never use again.
"I refuse to even use UPS as it has been a nightmare. I have had more than a few bad experiences when I ordered through Amazon and had the items not delivered, or delivered to the wrong place. My last order got shipped to a Sherwin Williams and the seller would not refund the item because the PAINT STORE SIGNED FOR IT. I am still fighting for an 800$ refund from July 2022.
So a few weeks ago on 3/20 I ordered a gift from eBay as it was an amazing deal. I got a 600$ item for 300$. I never have used eBay, and the seller promised to send it through USPS. Turns out, he sent it through UPS and the estimated delivery was March 23. It is now April 4th and I still have no delivery. Ups can't tell me anything, and I am out 330$ and the box is just missing.
How can the company be so bad? I will never ever use UPS no matter what. What a horrible company."
Paid for 1 day delivery and package took 4 days to be delivered. Misleading and an untrustworthy company. There are many other options of companies to use so I would recommend someone else.
F.ing s.hit solution you provide. UPS.com keep sending me my choice activation PIn which do not work. Whom ever are in charge of the department which operate the solution should be fired. Amateurs
"A package from Newegg Computers was to be delivered to my home office and the driver showed up with the package. I have him on my Ring doorbell video ringing my doorbell. Because I was not there and it required a signature because my g/f's name was on the shipper, and the address was correct, he decided to immediately (within an hour of ringing my doorbell) put the package on a truck back to the sender. I called UPS within an hour of his arrival and spoke with a SUPERVISOR who assured me the driver screwed the pooch and she was ordering the package back to my home address and the dispatcher would call me on Saturday to confirm, which he did call and we exchanged pleasantries and confirmed re-delivery to my home by this next Thursday. The dispatcher told me he would call on Monday (yesterday) to confirm all was well. He did NOT call on Monday in spite of giving me his word he would call. Today is Tuesday. Delivery is supposed to be on Thursday. I followed up again today to make sure it didn't get screwed up again and another SUPERVISOR this morning told me the 1st SUPERVISOR and the Dispatcher BOTH gave the wrong information and the package is on its way back to the sender. I told this latest supervisor I would be embarrassed and humiliated for UPS to have to tell the customer that no one at UPS knows what they're talking about. UPS is a broken business."
Worst service.i would like to request if you want to receive your parscel soon then don't use this ups. Its took almost 13 days to delivered.
My package was lost and it took forever for investigation. Second time the vendor shipped out my stuff it was signature required. Low and behold it was delivered but driver didn’t knock on my door. Who signed it? Took over 1 month to get my stuff that should have only taken a week. Ups is worse than FedEx
"Suppose to receive this order today but instead I received a order that was to be delivered on a later date today the same time as a porn star go free on onlyfans when y’all been stroking them they whole life ! Run me my order ! Call the Ups in Grenada, MS to track package but they rudely sent me to call 8008771760 lying saying the could tell me where my package is exactly! Called that number and they directed me to call another number! I hung up that’s too much just to be lied too!"
Can I give it a 0? Absolutely horrible service the worst I’ve ever had. I requested to send back a package to the sender around 6 times now. It has been over a month and the package has been sitting in the same spot. I just called again to see what’s going on and she told me there has been no request made to send the package!?! This is the 6th person I have spoke with!! I am hundreds of dollars down because of this. Not impressed at all.
"Package addressed to my house was instead delivered to local Amazon warehouse (no where even close). Calling UPS, there was no explanation or offer to help, just customer (dis)service agent sticking to their script. After filing an 'investigation', there has been NO communication that the matter is being looked into. Calling UPS help line, I get the same run around and scripted 'apologies' on two occasions. After getting nowhere there, I visited the Amazon warehouse where the staff were very helpful. They explained this is NOT unusual, that UPS frequently delivers items there by mistake. Amazon turns the items around the same or next day, returning them to UPS. SO, after that discovery, contacting UPS again yields no different response, only that I have to wait 3 weeks (15 business days) for followup. YIKES! Shipper has also contacted UPS to no avail.
Shipper describes the experience as 'infuriating'. I would echo that sentiment."
Not very happy with thier service.... they are slower than the US Postal Service! Every package I've ever received from UPS is late by 1-2 days. They are never on time.
"I'm wondering that Microsoft is using this delivery company.

I ordered XBOX gamepad in official store. After the date of delivery the status was changed to ""cannot be delivered due to business was closed"". But I ordered it to my apartment address. Double checked the address on UPS web site and the address is right.

Next day the status was updated again to the same ""cannot be delivered"". And the next day the same.

I wrote to their support after the first day, but there was nothing, just an automatic reply that they got my email.

But, how Microsoft is saling something online with this kind delivery partner 🤓"
Waiting for a parcel at home been in all day to get an update saying driver attempted to deliver package. This is not the first time that this has happened. This company’s service is sub par.
"Company should be closed
My dealing with them is NEVER AGAIN. Waiting for my package more than 4 weeks, attempting delivery apparently and still nothing. Ups is useless company."
A bunch of liars specially Bernice Fernandez who works in Van nuys CA. She has been a homewrecker and is stealing men in that place left and right. She's horrible at talking to co workers with cuss words being her top plus insults to over weight people.
"Very bad service, it seems they steal packages, and when you try to file a complaint or open a claim the give you the run around."
Everything is automated and you cannot talk to a real person. They set it up so the computer just tells you what they want you to know then hangs up on you.
"I checked your website, says you deliver 7 days a week residentially yet my package that is only 30 minutes away sat there all weekend, I could have picked it up myself, now you want a signature that was not stated when the item was bought and we’re not even sure if we’ll be around, I will be using fed ex from now on"
My order was left in my garage as I requested in a note i left for delivery man. My order was a carpet rug which needed shelter. Thanks UPS
"UPS lost my parcel with boots inside that cost 790 euro ( provided receipt and all my transactions proving it). I was waiting for full payment of my item, ( but got only 105 euro. This company misleads you, never gives the exact facts what is with your property, the tracking shows that it arrived at destination country, after 2 months of my personal investigation, I found out that it didn’t cross the borders. I was in touch all the time with their representatives , but they lost it despite all my effort and askings to send it back to me. Instead of 3 days it to be delivered, it took 10 days and also lost at their facility. This is a crime company, I lost all my nerves and got huge stress with them that actually reflected on my health. I’m starting a legal action against them!!!!!"
"Worst courier company there is, was told it would be delivered on the Friday after paying express delivery of £15. Tracking just kept saying it would be delivered by “the end of the day” waited in all day for it not to even be delivered, called customer service just to be told to keep checking the tracking and they couldn’t even give a delivery window. 1-2 days express delivery is an absolute scam still not received my parcel and they won’t even tell me when it will be delivered, filing a complaint and asking for a refund."
"Just awful. Left a note to say they had attempted delivery and that it had been left at an Access Point. I went there (my local post office) to be told that they don't have it; they no longer accept UPS parcels due to ""issues"".
UPS told the sender that it had been delivered and no one now seems to know where the package is! I am now in dispute with the seller."
"I was not home they left me a note that they missed me but my 2 siblings and their significant other was home and said that there was no one that came. When I contacted UPS they said they were going to help and they would call back 1 hour later but instead it took 5 hours. I was the one to call them again only to be told that there was nothing they could even they promised they would deliver it again on same day. What a joke of a company, a company made to deliver mail but fail to do now I have to wait 3 days just to get it at my local UPS what a joke."
"Driver came to pickup an amazon return, he was great!!! Very pleasant and great personality. One of nicest person I have ever met"
A stain on delivery service. This company does not care if their customer gets their package. 800$ lost and they say there is nothing they can do. I am Livid
"Ups is completely and utterly inept. I gave a one star because that is the lowest I could leave otherwise would have been negative. Out of the last 6 orders that ups was supposed to deliver, I received 2 as they claim they cant find my address even though no other company has an issue. Of the two, both were smashed. I recently ordered a futon on amazon which was shipped UPS. Of course I didn't get it because UPS smashed it and it cost me over 2 weeks of my time waiting. I even told friends that I would not be getting it because it is UPS and will be destroyed before it arrives. I will never order from a company that ships UPS. Horrible company"
"This company is absolutely rubbish in my opinion.
They do not ring door bell and drop missed you note 'redeliver next day ' Again leave you a missed you note
without ringing your doorbell but this time asked to pick up at there ups asset point location with time ??? (30th March- after 16.30pm)
Went to pick up the next day , was told by store that parcel is not here yet ???"
I would never ship with you UPS again they broke the neck on a 1974 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe I paid for insurance and they did nothing. The brown truck will put a frown on your face I don't care what company you use do not use this one or you will regret it. They will break a rock if you ship it they are complete loosers. Do yourself a favor and use FedEx
Trash Trash Trash do not every use or buy from sites or companies that use it. Almost guaranteed something wrong will happen. Truly bad experience
I ordered several products that gets lost site shows it’s not even in US then package out for delivery that get returned to sender. I sit here waiting all day no call no delivery tracking updates because their stupid tracking site is the worse I ever use. No contact to driver so basically the driver can say he attempted to deliver when he really made no attempt. I never have these problems with Amazon or USPS! UPS needs to get out of the package delivery business! Terrible company. I’m calling all my merchants and if they use UPS I’m not ordering!
"UPS customer service is HORRIBLE. Although I have very clear delivery instructions linked to my Amazon account, 7/12 of my last order that were supposed to be delivered by UPS were “unable to be delivered.” On one of those occasions, I was literally standing in my parking lot waving at the driver as he drove away before I got the message “delivery attempted.” Their automated helpline is abysmal. They want your tracking number, but even speaking very clearly directly into the microphone, the AI “didn’t get that.” And, because their tracking numbers contain letters, there’s no way to input it using your keypad. I called four times and eventually was hung up on before speaking to a human every time. I had to claim I was “returning a call” to speak to a human. I was promised a call back within an hour, but haven’t gotten one four hours later. Since Amazon doesn’t let you know which carrier service will deliver your package, and I will NOT be using UPS anymore, it’s time to cancel Amazon. Shame."
"UPS delivered a damaged package to my Ebay customer. The whole package was torn, part of it was missing. The Crystal Vase was destroyed. I tried to open a claim. The form is so bad that I couldn't finish my claim and after two days it disappeared and I couldn't open the second one. I called every day and UPS spoke to 12 people and two managers. My claim is still not finished. What a terrible company and how they treat customers. The first destroy the shipment later they make problems with the completion of the claim. I honestly didn't expect to be treated like this. NO MORE UPS, WHAT A HORRIBLE COMPANY"
"Do you have a missing or lost UPS package ???

Good Luck speaking to customer service at UPS.

Their automated computer will dance around in circles with you and will avoid you in speaking to a representative at all costs and then kick you in the face and hang up on you !!"
They didn't leave my package because it's a commercial adress but the business is closed for good so obviously the office won't be open. Then they want to charge $8 to hold the package at a ups store for pickup. I already paid for shipping I shouldn't have to pay more to be able to actually receive my package. They are a total rip off company. I don't reccomend anybody use them. Plus their shipping is much slower than other companies. From now on if a seller uses ups to ship I won't even order from them. I'm now going to miss my appointment to have my brakes put on my car all because they won't actually deliver my brakes.
Amy and John at the Centerbrooke location on route 10 in Suffolk Va were the best! The store employees are always helpful. Amy took the time to show me how to change a label on my Amazon return to make it easier for me. This location is always helpful and friendly! 5 star service!!!!
UPS is the worst delivery service in the entire world without a sliver of doubt. I have never in my life recieved a package from them without millions of problem. This last time they didn't even try to deliver my package they just sent it back to where it came from. Don't ever trust UPS!
They said my package would come so I took the day off work it never came and it hasn't even been sent out yet. I have a limited amount of days off and this out me under extra stress and I would never use ups again
"My parcel it was supposed to be delivered today and then I have tried to call customer service and email them and they re not giving any answers and it's scanned for delivery today


And the company even said I would be having it today"
"Poor customer service. Twitter help worthless.
Failure to listen & take correct address & contact details. Somehow thats my fault & costs $30 to correct. Would quite happily leave zero stars if it was possible.
Will never use again."
"They are lying all the time, recipient was not available for delivery, but we was at home all the day."
"I’d leave zero stars if I could. I ordered a welding machine & it was shipped by ups. It was supposed to be signed for. They said it was delivered. I never got it. When asked where they delivered it, they said they put it at the end of the driveway. I never got it. It was stolen. Now I’m out a $4,500.00 welding machine & they won’t make it good. Pure sorry I’m my book."
"The truck was on the next block on my street and when I looked at the map about 30 minutes later it was way across town. I don't know how you route the deliveries, but I'm pretty disappointed. It wouldn't be such an issue if it wasn't refrigerated vials of medicine I'm waiting on that I have to sign for. The customer service tells me the same thing the website does. Its no help."
"I paid $$ to enter a juried exhibit in PA. My painting was accepted and I shipped it, with plenty of time to spare for the exhibit opening, via UPS because that is what the gallery wanted. Today, UPS returned my painting to me without every having delivered it to the gallery. What a waste of money and time. Will never use them again. It's Fed-X from now on."
"Tracking 1Z2668A16893139463
Arranged to have the morning off and no one came? No delivery not? Can't re Arrange delivery/collection because of no delivery note bar code. No one answering 01709530058. I rang 03457877877 and I was told they deliver it today still so I Arranged to be in this afternoon. Nothing came Shi* service"
I waited the whole day for a UPS driver who never showed up. I lost my time and money because I was supposed to do something else instead of staying at home. Not the least excuse. Nothing.
"Ups delivery sent my wife an email to say delivery will be tomorrow.
Never came to deliver and yet the tracking message stated delivery attempted but no one in.
CCTV proves that no delivery was attempted at all. The ups app stated will deliver next business day but again no delivery, in fact the message states The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible. That was yesterday.
We have a 1B on our street, and our number is 18, I wonder if the daft driver is going to 1B and not 18.
Tried to contact UPS but found this very difficult but managed in the end to find an email. Waiting for a reply."
"Absolutely the worst courier service in uk, they give you a time slot but never turn up for it so absolutely no point waiting in for them. They move time slot to end of day which might mean it’s 😡 lost. No communication from them just awful service. If I had a choice I would never use these as a company"
Very disappointed by the service. I called UPS Hong Kong confirming about delivery which has been pending for 4 days now… They were supposed to deliver the parcel today by 7:30pm which they failed to when I confirmed again they said it will deliver by 10:30 pm and again no show.. When I called the hotline service is closed…
Most unorganised unhelpful logistic company i've ever dealt with. Avoid at all costs
I hate this service. They don't how to contact customers and that's why delivery is always delayed.
ups stans for ooooops do not ship anything with this useless company.
"I have had a terrible experience with UPS. Despite waiting all day for my package, the delivery driver was unable to deliver it because they couldn't figure out how to use the key pad to get into my apartment building. The customer service was even worse; first, they promised to redeliver the package, but later instructed me to go to a location one hour away from my apartment, which was difficult to reach. Upon arrival, they informed me that they had given me the wrong address and sent me somewhere else. Given that this was an urgent order, I had a very negative experience with this UPS company."
Very disappointed that my delivery date updates keep getting pushed back and back. Probably not going to order goods that ship via UPS anymore. I could have hitchhiked to California and back to get my meter much quicker.
"UPS, do not ship anything through UPS unless there is only one courier company left in the world. Packages always delay, driver won't ship your package on schedule date. better to pay little more to others."
"if I see a retailer using UPS now, I just don't purchase"
"They knock on the door and refuse to wait for a disabled person to get to the door, next day they come and refuse to even knock the door, just put a note through, a final attempt note, even though only 2nd attempt, not 3rd. Utterly vile company, zero respect for customers. I wish the well known 'auction/buy it now' site would ban them as a carrier"
I've been in the same apartment for 23 years! And UPS has picked up here for me as long as I've had an Amazon account so I can return and I pay for this! Well this time whoever the driver was and they know who it was cuz I could talk to the lady that called me back I had to hang up on her cuz she said somebody else must have taken it which nobody it's not even seen from the sidewalk up my stairs when I put it outside I did it at 5:00 in the morning and she's arguing with me as long as I'm giving them money to pick up at the same address? Well he picked it up all right and left me the whole shipping label so there's a package out there with $62 shoes in it going nowhere and it's probably in the truck and he would never tell anybody that he forget to put the label on it! Not happy and that's putting it mildly! They will never get my money again for a pickup! Kudos to Amazon for giving me the refund back to my account anyway so I can get the right size! Do not use UPS pickup! Just warning you in my area!
Worst carrier I met so far. Customer service is hopeless. They held back the package for no reason for a week.
"I wish to write a review on Allen, UPS driver in Cleveland TN, delivered to 211 Ocoee TRACE NW ON 3/27/23. He was ex exceptionally polite and helpful with a large pkg. I appreciated his kindness."
"Trying not to be too harsh, but the driver that delivers to us is about lame. Instead of putting it in the mailbox that is right next to the driveway gate, he throws it over the fence or leaves boxes right in front of the gate that you literally have to push out of the way to get out. So, try to call the nearest location, goes to the main office and get this, they don't have a phone number for these locations. All phone calls get routed back to them so you really can't get to the location without physically going there. Figure this out, trying to work with the people that keep you guys in a job is more beneficial than not working with us."
"lazy bone idle
driver did not even ring door bell I been in all day ,so he left calling card address I did not no but now do and I been there 3 times and still not been dropped of .says after 6 so I went 6,15 7 oc 7,30 just gave up .I hope never to use this shower again as just like Evri"
"They never inform the customer about packages situation so they basically just expects us to do all the work in checking which for example means that at least in their tracking website package status can be seen. But still customers should always be informed if package is arrived or whatever status it got. So because of this, customers may miss the package completely because they never got any notification. This type of service is terrible."
"these stupid drivers dont even come to my door, dont even put the post card. customer service is not good as well, very bad company ...."
Your drives are the dumbest drivers I know. After waiting all day on a package . The driver said the could not delivery the package because he could not get in the apartment buliding he could not figure out how to use a key pad.if your needs how put in apartment number so I buzz them I can show them it's not that hard if the can count. Lets hope the next driver can count on Monday? James Carter Phoenix ax
Ups refused to deliver a package with important legal documents call customer service I can't even speak English and rude and ignorant the last time I'll ever deal with UPS they can kiss my ass
"Worst! Lost my package twice! Ordered paint from Home Depot online and shipping by UPS. Lost my package after 1 month of following up. Reordered again from HD and same thing, package was not delivered. 3 months total waiting and nothing. DON'T ORDER ANYTHING ONLINE FROM HOME DEPOT!!! coz they use this garbage delivery service!!!!"
"trash company that leave your package with out notice, they ask to leave a message and them do not follow the instructions. how they can work doing like that, a left a message where they can leave with my next door neighbor, and they drop in from of my door and another neighbor found and let me know. I did not choose the have a business with you unfortunately was the company that sent."
Delivery does not show up in the two hour window they give and did not try to get a hold of me when showing up. Call customer service. Get the automated system and all they tell you is what they can't do. 10 minutes of fighting with something that doesn't even exist to get to a person. They tell me someone will call in an hour. Nobody calls and no package delivery. Awesome.
Horrible service .. Was told my package was delivered to my apartment locker package system .. wasn't in the locker .. the courier took a picture of the top of the elevator and not the package in the locker .. called and asked for help .. was told I would be called in a hour and I've never heard from anyone ... Totally lied to .. they don't care
Ther're suppose to deliver on satardays. My package arrived at local facility at 1am saturday morning. Was not delivered until Monday!
"The package came beat-up, wilted, and water stained on a majority of the package. To the driver's credit, he made certain I was aware of it before he left it. To be fair, I can not know who, down the line, was responsible."
"Literally the worst delivery/courier service, customer support is awful, delivery protocol is awful, everything always gets returned to sender

NEVER USE UPS"
"I paid all the duties and they still keep the packages after 2 weeks!!! Phone 3 times and never done anything, I am still waiting and waiting... I would never use UPS for sending anything, they are getting worst and worst everytime."
"Absolute 3rd class service, constantly lied to by customer service and drivers.

Do not use this company , do not trust them with your parcels"
"Wish I could give 0 Star rating. First they said “no one was home” - in correct.

Then they said another attempt would be made - never happened.

Then apparently the item was delivered to a completely different Post Code.

Called them only to find out this was their depot. They wanted be to go collect it. I’d paid the supplier £6.95 for delivery!!

Asked them to redirect it. Advisor said would be 24 hours. 48 hours later - the request had just been submitted, will be another 24 hours.

Oh the ‘Advisor’ thought I was calling from abroad. Couldn’t recognise a UK Phone Number - I had repeat it multiple times is various ways and then he causes me of not saying it properly!!!

To complain or File a Claim I have to Register with them!!

Latest advisor told me to “consult a Lawyer”!!"
I ordered a nice Flip phone from Koodo for my birthday. Needless to say it came a day later but they left the note at my door and when I went to pickup spot the next Day it wasn't even there. Finally I got my package 3 days later
"It's not that UPS has wronged me, but what a terrible and annoying site. Whoever is doing UX in regards to your package management really dropped the ball.

Compared to competitors the site is absolute garbage. You would do much better if you just blatantly copied a competitor, because I do not believe you are in a position to do better."
You need to go out business. Service is the worst. You tracking is never uploaded. Package always arrive whenever. Always a bad experience when getting a deliver
"Unbeknownst to me, ordered a paint set from a hobby shop in southern ontario. The price was much cheaper than amazon thus tempting. Once the package got to within a city away they suddenly said there was weather issues. A week passes. No update on their tracking app. Called customer service ane they said they couldn't deliver to my address and it's the next city over. They had to pass through my town to get there. If it wasn't deliverable why didn't they contact me? Gave them a new address and said yes 2 days from now. It's now another week and nothing. I called cutomer service again and they said they would call be back. I don't understand why all these delivery companies are this incompetent with no consequences."
"I rate 1 star because i was unable to rate 0. It is incredible that this company is still profitble. In order to the genious of the driver to understand addresses you must complete a whole description, including DNA, type of blood, colour of the bathroom and kitchen, if not they are not capable of finding a big walmart."
"I have used UPS for more than 10 years, but its service quality is always decreasing! My last experience was disaster! I ordered a collection service from Denmark to Finland. I insured the package because of the high value of the package. Once I received the parcel (collected from the service point), one of the items was bent and physically damaged. I opened a claim but UPS didn't approve it despite my positive documents.
Moreover, UPS collection and delivery from and to the residential addresses really useless and ridiculous.
This will be my last experience with UPS!!!!"
"THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE OF ALL JOKES!!!!!!
I HATE UPS! I ASKED THEM TO LEAVE MY PACKAGE AND JUST WON'T"
"I was told that they couldn't find my house. Used the same address as always.

Probably the driver was too lazy to find a suitable parking spot..."
"Do not use , we booked online to send a parcel. We gave the dimensions and weight and paid £32.58. When the parcel was collected we had to pay an additional £4.01 to the driver. We then had an additional £50 taken from our payment card (which we did not authorise) so we raised a complaint and forwarded all information requested by ups. Two weeks later we had an invoice for £4.01 . I called ups to ask about the invoice they said it was the collection charge (which we already paid) I also asked about our complaint and overpayment, they said the complaint was closed. So to sum up ups charge more than they quote. And charge twice for their service"
"Ups delivery stated they delivered my package at my address, they did not! I was in a panic, I was home all day, I even have cameras outside my home, and “NO” delivery personnel was at my house! I checked with neighbors to see if my package was left mistakenly at their address. They all stated, no package was left of mine at their address! There’s a house unoccupied where I found my package. Needless to say, I was “PISSED”! I contacted UPS customer service, which is a joke, their online service to make a claim is impossible! Terrible customer service."
"Worst courier service , highly unprofessional attitude , no responsible person sitting at any place in ups, they don't even bother to address the problems created by them. One of filing clerk sitting their has filed wrong bill of entry and now nobody in the ups is owning the responsibility , no one is willing to make correction , if any body in the ups feels shame on unprofessional , irresponsible attitude please call me at +918295322955"
"UPS do not recieve messages without login - no way José!

To ALTERNATE Gmbh

I am sorry to inform you that UPS (Unreliable Parcel Service) so far has failed to deliver my package.

I live on a small island and am used to minor problems concerning delivery. However, most serious carriers have an arrangement with the national postal service to deliver what they cannot deliver themselves.

In this case you shipped the package 10/3 2023, as you informed me about by mail. After a few days I tried to to track the package, but UPS homepage only stated that the package was in their main storage in Copenhagen ”pending delivery”.

I heard nothing whatsoever from UPS, and 20/3 2023 I lost patience and wasted quite a lot of time making contact to USB customer service by telephone. The lady had no explanation, but offered to change the delivery adress to an UPS pick up point. They are few and far between, but we agreed on a point 30 kilometers away.

UPS took another 5 days for the transport from Copenhagen to the pick up point, a mere 120 kilometers, but today I recieved – no, not recieved, but saw when I for the 10th time tracked my package – the information that it was now available at the pick up point.

I grabbed the first ferry and drove to to pick up point.

But the package was nowhere to be found. The lady in charge called Unreliable Parcel Service, who shugged their virtual shoulders and told me to contact my supplier.

My company has now been without printer for 2 weeks, so I hope you understand that I now need to procure the toner locally from someone who uses a reliable carrier, and I kindly ask you to return my money.

I must stress that my communication with your company was flawless, and I feel sorry for you that your good reputation is tainted by your ureliable business associate.

”The bitterness of bad service lingers long after the sweetness of low price is gone”

Sincerely Yours,

Jan Kofod Larsen"
"They lost a package, and aren't even trying to find it. Closed the Investigation TWICE, with no resolve. If I had their customer service, I would get fired, without hesitation."
"We ordered five foam sheets on Amazon. They were supposed to arrive together in ""one big box"". But UPS delivered one on Monday, 20 March, two on 22 March, and the remaining two were delivered to the wrong address. We received a message from a neighbor about it."
"Don't use UPS!
I ordered a hoodie as a birthday gift. They lost the package and it had to be resent, so, of course, I didn't get it on time. Now, even though I already paid around 30 euros for the delivery (and they lost the package), they want me to pay 30 more for some made-up fees. The hoodie itself costs 60 euros so my order price doubled. If I knew the delivery will be that expensive I wouldn't have ordered. They will not give me the package unless I pay them more money. This is blackmail and I don't understand how this kind of shady practice can be legal.
Don't use UPS in any circumstances!"
"I sat at Home waiting for My Delivery watched Truck Drive right By My House didn’t stop then I tracked my delivery said they attempted to Deliver, there wasn’t even a Sticker on my Door to say they Had Tried how can they Just Blatantly Lie I have Cameras to prove no Driver came to my Door Worst Service Ever!!!"
"I try talking to a Representative just asking a simple question, why can't their drivers Knock on that person door when they drop off package, this Representative gave ME HELL"
"If I could give less than 1 star, I would. My package was delivered to the wrong town (New Market, MD rather than Frederick MD). It's impossible to get a human on the phone. Filing a claim online was not user friendly and then UPS emailed me the paperwork that should have gone to the sender (vs. me, the intended recipient). One job, UPS. Match package to address."
"It's been 6 days now for so called 2 days delivery. The package doesn't even move .. they're tracking system is complete joke .. I rathered have chosen local post to deliver my parcel than these incompetent company for paying 110£.. one thing is for sure, I will never use this courier again neither recommend it to anyone."
Absolutely avoid sending anything via UPS. That’s all I have to say!
"Completely useless company.. I use DHL and Fedex for the same regular business shipping however have chosen UPS due to lower costs. My parcel has been held for over a week with 5 emails and 11 calls in one week almost all asking me the same one question.. I provided this response (which was literally reason for shipment) on email and over the phone and over the course of 4 days my parcel was held up as they didn't have this piece of information.
At one point, I got a call (after 2 emails) to tell me they don't have my email address and if I could provide it.
There seems to be a real unacceptable lack of record keeping or communication within UPS. Would not use again"
"Had a package being delivered to the Philippines was supposed to be delivered on the 24th of March. Then I get an email they're sorry they tried to deliver the package at 7:53 in the morning. So then they put the package on hold, if they really were at the home in the Philippines why didn't they leave a card on the door? No the guy doesn't do that So I call Amazon and Amazon tries to get ahold of UPS in Manila and it took her an hour to get a hold of a rep and then she wants my name and my email address. For what I've already had packages delivered to this address what's this? UPS is a joke a total joke. Now the representative from Amazon says she will send you an email on the 27th of this month and I said I thought the package according to you guys was supposed to be delivered on the 24th. I'm sorry sir I can't do anything about what they do. But if you don't get the delivery sent call back on Monday and we'll give your money back. Don't use UPS as your choice for shipping there is bad as the United States post office."
"I work with Amazon and UPS weekly. Amazon is 99.9% on time and often early. USPS is just on time and reliable.. UPS I use sparingly of I have no choice and each and every time my order starts with an arrival date of say Wednesday, which becomes Thursday and then Tuesday of the following week. This company should just cut their losses and let someone else buy them."
"I ordered a very expensive catalytic converter from a UK subsidiary of a French manufacturer on Monday(20 March 2023). There was no choice of carrier and I paid £116 for Express ""24 Hour delivery"" because the part was needed by the garage repairing my car which had been with them since 9 February! I had notification from UPS that delivery to the garage would be today between 8:30 and 11:00. Nothing arrived and the Tracking Section of the UPS website was still saying delivery would be today between those times, even though it was 15:30! I've just looked at the Tracker at it's saying the same times but tomorrow now. What a waste of money and it reflects so badly on the supplier. I need my car back urgently: come on UPS, get your finger out."
"Horrible customer service experience - it's impossible to reach a real agent when something goes wrong/unexpected with a delivery. They also don't deliver in accordance with their delivery schedule, which is equivalent to scamming customers because you pay a high delivery fee and don't get your items in time"
"UPS is ripping ppl off. They said they attempted to deliver my package and left a number for me to make changes online, they didn’t. They then charged me $8 to pick up the package at a UPS store. I got free shipping on my package and now UPS is still going to charge me for their driver lying. Is this normal practice UPS. Shameful"
"USP used to be okay, but since a year or so their service has turn into a joke. They continuosly claim that no one is home but there's always someone at home. I had no issue whatsoever with any other carrier. They then send my package to a random pick up point, sometimes far away and incredibly inconvenient to reach. Businesses should steer clear of this company if you want to provide seamless shopping experiences."
"The UPS customer service hotline is about as worthless as the Synchrony Bank hotline. The automation is worthless. It is time we get back to taking to humans. If this is the type of service we continue to obtain as a society, we will be damned. We should currently be outraged that UPS and its systems are non user friendly and have created more chaos than benefit."
"Ups need to be shut down, their crew is not experience enough to even answer a phone.
They give wrong information, full of crap.
They need more training, obviously they hire anybody."
"UPS was instructed by seller to deliver to USPS (then to me). The UPS delivery driver in Grand Rapids, MI took the package to USPS at 8:57 a.m. USPS not open until 9:00 a.m. So, the delivery driver didn't wait 3 minutes, or even know the USPS hours of operation, and now the package will have to wait until tomorrow to be delivered to USPS"
"I would give a zero but that's not an option. I order some clothing and when I got my tracking information realized it was going to a previous address. It says you can update the info on line or change it to pick it up. No such option that I could find. I called customer service and because the automated system couldn't ""get"" my tracking number, after I entered it 4 times, it disconnected me. No way to speak to a person!!!!"
"I ordered a chef’s knives set from knives from Japan so I received an email from ups on Sunday 19th March saying that they will be delivering this item on Tuesday the 21st March between 9am to 11am but no delivery was made but instead at 11.30am on the same day the suddenly changed the delivery to the end of day but I had already cancelled my doctors appointment from Tuesday the 21 March and booked it for the same day so expect you to wait for them to turn up when they please i then went to my doctor appointment and came home but no delivery or any card but on their tracking service it changed to delivered so don’t know which neighbour they had left it with or if they did the item was supposed to be signed for at the time of this review I don’t know where my order is will have to go knock on all the neighbours door ups are unreliable, and inconsiderate I won’t have any dealings with this third rate company if I really don’t have to"
"UPS is a disaster; you call and only the automatic system takes the call and can’t understand your tracking number.
We need more shooing company."
"just go with Fedex, UPS is lazy and Fedex will deliver a week earlier"
"Takes days longer than it should to send a package, one of my packages stayed in Oregon for 25 hours before they decided to proceed with the shipping process 5 days should be 4 days, a month should be 3 weeks, I watch packages sit at shipping facilities for days and not moving."
"Tried to ship a firearm today have shipped hundreds over the years as a licensed dealer was told today they will no longer ship firearms from Longmont Co! I also own a large company that averages over 5,000 per month in UPS shipping charges as of this posting we just changed to Fed EX!"
Despite instructing them to leave the packake by the front door they insist that it needs to be signed for. Every other company has left packages by the front door with no problem so why are you different. Just follow my request as otherwise it will be returned to the USA. Now 1st April and still nothing. Now 3rd April and guess what zilch. One Star is one to many! Now 11th April and they still will not deliver it as requested.
"STOP...DO NOT USE UPS
Paid for next day delivery for 2 parcels of porcelain to the same address. One arrived late and in 100 pieces.
UPS refused compensation stating packaging did not conform to their recommendations even though I was asked by supplier to return item in original manufacturing container. Small print dictates they can dispose of any damaged item which in their view is unrepairable and they don't even have to discuss it with you. So the so called insurance is no benefit and I was out of pocket £300.Claiming was a waste of time as I received a phone call from the States informing me they can do just about anything they like!"
"I scheduled a delivery collection and they never turned up and when I called they said they never even had it planned into the route and I’d waited in all day for them to collect, I had confirmation on my end that it had been schedule. Poor service."
"What is this company playing at ,total waste of time,I had a delivery due ,I saw the van out and went to see if it was my delivery only to see the van drive off ,on looking on my CCTV I watch the delivery man walk up to the door make no attempt to knock or ring the bell,he had already scanned the package before getting to the door,then turned around and drove off with my delivery,I rang ups straight away and would have got more sense out of a foot ,what a bunch of clowns"
"I cannot believe the level of incompetence of UPS.
I hear excuse after excuse as to why my urgent airfreight parcel hasn't been shipped to me.
my promised date was 16 March, today the 20th?
I will never use this service/Company again."
They changed my delivery date twice which was very inconvenient as I had to change my work schedule each time.
"UPS claimed they delivered this parcel to the addressee but they did not. They have presented a random unknown signature which is not from the only person who lives there and there was no delivery there. The tracking was vague and while in one place it said the parcel was delivered to the address it was sent to, in another place it said it was delivered to a ""UPS Access Point"" but didn't mention which one. The person who should have received the parcel had to go around FOUR shops miles apart in the rain to try and locate the parcel but it was nowhere to be found. WHAT TYPE OF SERVICE IS THIS????"
"It seems that these guys will do everything on purpose so that you don't receive your package as long as possible. And to get on your nerves as much as possible. It seems that the place of this company is in hell, not on the Earth."
My package was delivered to my neighbors house AGAIN! Do drivers have to know how to read cause at least the one assigned to my address apparently doesn't know how to!
All my delivery with ups took 2 weeks or longer although the shipping specifically said 2 days or has a guaranteed delivery date. For example for amazon prime member. UPS loves dragging their butts doing delivery! Right now I’m waiting for my delivery from BestBuy that was supposed to arrive yesterday but UPS hasn’t even picked up the item and postponed the date to the end of the month! I honestly rather have ONTRAC/FEDEX delivery my packages! Why even exist?!
"My husband was scammed and the package was sent UPS. I finally got a hold of someone, which was ridiculously difficult. I explained the problem and was assured that the package would be returned. I called and tried to keep them on top of it, and was told do not worry. They delivered the package to the scammer and now will not respond to my messages. Our lives have been destroyed. They are just as bad as the scammer IMHO."
Bad. Just a bad managed company. Everything about them is just wrong. Unfortunately the UK law still permits to these rubbish companies to exist and function. Avoid UPS !!!!!
"The mailman who delivered my package to the apartment building left with all the mailboxes open. I heard things were stolen. I was home at delivery and they didn’t even buzz me. Delivery proof was: mailbox. My neighbor actually had the package, they thought it might get stolen.

And this is just one of the many dissapointing experiences i’ve had with UPS."
"UPS delivery from the UK was fantastic, so quick and reasonable..."
"If I could rate this company with a Minus 10-
I Ordered from Amazon early March, told be sent by March 9-10..received a notice no answer at door, live in condo complex you have to call in to our apartment never received call, then 2 more occasions one wrong address RIDICULOUS! Topper of it all seen delivery truck ON 2 OCCASIONS DRIVE BY DIDN'T STOP and notified Package could not be delivered. Calling for tracking????May as well bang your head on wall tBy far the most useless company. My brother in law once said in joking matter
UPS stand for USELESS PIECE OF SH-- .Been confirmed. Now my package is supposedly delivered have not received it today March 17 2023??? NEVER AGAIN....😐 OUT $90.00"
"This is the worst delivery service on earth!!! I ordered a package from Italy and the vendor used UPS. They have changed estimated delivery time 3 times with no reason whatsoever, I called customer service and they kept telling me 7pm, it got to 7pm they told me it has been delayed for 1 business day and when I track it it keeps telling me 12pm the previous day.
I have no idea what to do, even the staff don’t know where the package is or how to handle it. I am frustrated!! I leave the country on Tuesday and that was meant to be a gift for someone . No I’m not even sure they will deliver on Monday before I travel. I don’t trust anything they say!!! I’m so pained !!"
"UPS are a terrible courier service. Every single time they deliver something it goes wrong. The last time was delivery of a large item that was promised ""by the end of the day"" and never arrived; it finally arrived in the afternoon of the following day. On many other occasions I've received ""sorry we missed you"" slips shoved through the letterbox when I was home and awaiting a delivery, but they were just too lazy to ring the bell, meaning a frustrating trip to the post office each time. Their tracking information is completely inadequate and they don't bother to keep you informed. Really wish companies would choose another delivery service."
"The WORST delivery service EVER.
Just AVOID them otherwise you will be like me, waiting 3 weeks for a f.... delivery."
"Oh my God UPS should stand for unless piece of Sh**t very expensive sending a return item back to US from UK dropped the packed at UPS service point on the 11/03/2023 to be delivered to US around 16/03/2023 still seating at the service point in UK. My recommendation go with DHL or fedex next time UPS is useless companies like should be shutdown.
Update : Just received email from their GBexceptionresolutions Dept, asking for copy of export invoice and details of the shipment. What a bunch of incompetent monkeys. Not only I completed online a full comprehensive details of the shipment, I also included 3 copies of the invoice with the shipment when packaged was dropped at their facility. Just to show what type of company one is dealing with. A shower of Poo"
"This is honestly one of the worst delivery companies out there. It’s unbelievable how bad a company can be, it’s absolutely remarkable. Not on one occasion have I had a bad experience, but every time I have a package delivered by them; I have to go see a doctor because my blood pressure sky rockets. What a horrible company."
"I arranged a home pick up of some bulky items which were hard for me to take them to the delivery office, but no one came to pick up my items, no notification, no apology, no explanation.
I was expecting a home delivery a while ago from Phillips with Ups,but my item was never delivered at home, Ups never notified me where my package is and why it wasn't delivered to home. I traced the delivery and found out it was delivered at the delivery office, and it's quite far, I had no choice but to pick it up from there. I spent £100s and was entitled to a home delivery. I will never recommend this company to anyone ever!"
Exceptional fast and efficient delivery service.
"Everytime I use them my packages are either late, damaged or don't show up getting real tired of their sh**"
"I wish I wasn’t forced to use UPS by so many companies. UPS continues to lack customer service, continues to lose packages, if you make a request they charge you more and then don’t even fulfill the request. The ‘My UPS’ is a scam, they claim to have an option to get you a package sooner at a cost but will not deliver."
I'm disabled. I have no problem with the evening ups driver who delivers to my front door and very thoughtful. The afternoon driver always leave my heavy packages or boxes which I cannot carry in the mailroom and i had to try and carry the big box without collapsing and i had to try and kick the box inside my apartment out of breath. I called so many times about this problem nothing get solved.
If I could give zero stars or a minus I would. Absolutely no customer service support. Pay for a service and get none! Call support helpline but answer machine only on foreign language. No English option. One time lucky to get through and had phone out down on me when asked for a English speaker. Contacted US customer support - no help available there either. This supposed global service provider is a rip off!
UPS for a private company are useless they couldnt coordinate a pizz up in a brewery! There is no tracking window and no accountability for employees and leadership to deliver.. I dont believe they is any exceptional service from UPS they are a medocre and are open for someone to step into the market like Amazon to take them over who understand supply chain logistics and tracking
"I had a friend bring a pair of vintage hifi loudspeakers to be packed and shipped across the country to me. A week later, as I helped the UPS driver unload the speakers off his truck, we both felt them shift in the boxes and slam from one end of the box to the other end. The speakers are pretty heavy....around 50 pounds. I immediately opened the box to find only two layers of bubble wrap around the speakers, and about 8"" of empty space above them that allowed the speakers to slam from one end to the other (probably many times) during transport. Both speakers had significant damage on the tops and bottoms.

I insured them for less than I should have. $600. UPS also charged me over $600 to pack and ship them. I have sent more than a dozen pictures to the claims office, emailed them and called them multiple times. I have supplied them with my phone number and email address. This has taken almost a month, and now hours of my time. UPS have notified me three times that they have cancelled my insurance claim because they are unable to contact me, which is ridiculous, as I have answered every email I receive from them, and they have not called me.

In good faith, I paid for them to safely pack these speakers, paid for shipping and paid for insurance. The fact I am still waiting for this to be resolved is either poor and incompetent customer service, or worse; a blatant attempt not to honor the insurance I paid for in order to pad their profits.

As a frequent UPS customer, I'm very disappointed."
"Always the same, UPS stating they could not deliver, because they don't even try, and for their own conveince dump all at a local pickup point."
"UPS collection very unreliable. On multiple occasions. They seem to be getting worse. They change collection times without any effort to let the customer know. This leads to a great wast of time and set backs with customers who are expecting goods.
Phone service not particularly great either."
"Horrible UPS mu son sent his Guitar from Toronto in Canada to Lincoln NE has almost 3 weeks, he never received in Lincoln NE. All phone numbers that u find online from UPS any one talk to you and the Trac number just say that something is wrong but they don't say what is ?? You never can talk with anybody incredible abused UPS trac number"
"Track Your Package feature is USELESS!
Why UPS bothers to put estimated delivery times is a complete mystery. NEVER within the time window, NEVER ""On Time"", Driver shows up within a block several times a day and then ends up MILES away without delivering packages. How it makes sense to be within one block in the AM only to return several hours later is beyond inefficient and wasteful. I go out of my way to tell vendors to ship any way EXCEPT UPS."
I was supposed to get a package today and it is not here that UPS driver was very irresponsible drove past my mailbox three times did not stop and my package said it was delivered and my mother also had something be delivered and it wasn't delivered today either whenever it was supposed to be
Package delivered totally wet with my business cards wet and stuck together. It was not even raining today and they place the package in my garage so damaged in transit. Claims process too complex likely designed to discourage claims. Very unprofessional to drop a totally wet package and run. Disappointed with UPS
"My laptop that was being sent off to be serviced was lost by UPS and successfully passed the claims process last year. I insured my laptop when purchasing the label. They said the claims check was sent in December but I never got it. Customer Service for the claims department hangs up on me at some point every time and are not English speakers making it hard to understand whats happening. I ask for verification e-mails and never get one. I have asked for the option to have the payment sent to my card for a faster resolution. I am in school and have not had a laptop since December waiting for this payment. I never want to deal with UPS again after this experience. I spoke with them today and am told March 21st is the next time they can send out another check after stopping the last check Feb. 7 sending it to the wrong address. This has been a terrible experience on top of the hardship of not having a laptop for a whole semester. I am getting only $299 from them on my $320 laptop, if I ever even get it."
"Impossible to reach the page to give instruction to the courier, where to leave the parcel if we are out. Delivery didn’t come, got delayed as a result!"
"Delivery late and impossible to get real-time tracking. Their ""My Choice"" service simply doesn't work.
Getting through to customer services takes forever and they are of little use."
For years I've been receiving auto parts at my house with no problem. Now all of a sudden I can't get anything without a signature. I work. Maybe that's a foreign concept but I'm never going to be home at 1PM no matter how many notes the driver leaves. Problem solving must not be that common if the drivers can't figure that out. Leave the package or I don't know try a different time of day. These pre K educated drivers need help with the simplest of tasks. I hope they never try to get a job where brains are required.
"The service is horrible! I had to call customer service 5 times for a delivery.
As a credit, easy to reach them on the phone but each time the promised delivery was cancelled. I was furious with their performance. Never again!"
"unfortunately it is the worst transport available! I made a typographical error and put address number 23 instead of 24, I contacted the headquarters and they can neither change the address nor can I contact the distributor for a simple consultation, the first attempt must be made first, they told me, and then with consultation can they change it, as long as I call and ask for a change of address it should be possible, unacceptable for such a large company when all the other carriers serve you! I am very unhappy with UPS"
"Abysmal customer service, delivery drivers who can't follow simple delivery instructions, overpriced expedited delivery that isn't even expedited because delivery drivers and customer service don't follow simple instructions"
"These reviews prob never get read by UPS. I’m not sure how this company is successful and I will surely take my business to Fed Ex or Postal service. I encourage anyone reading this to do the same.
I just can’t let this go. I usually don’t complain about much but I can’t overlook the basics.
On 2/17/23, I used UPS. After checking the delivery status I got the message delayed because package was damaged.
I’m not exaggerating, I spent at least an hour trying to get past an automated phone message and finally reached a person….you guessed it…GUATEMALA. Does this company not have anyone in the US? While polite I was passed around from lost, to claims to damaged etc. finally I reached someone that told me to file a claim, but then proceeds to direct you to a website instead of handling it right there.
Anyway, I was told that the package was damaged. I said ship it back to me. Guess the response? Now it’s missing, not just the package, invoice but the entire box. So now it went from damaged to missing. I suspect it was employee theft, not by the driver but while at a receiving/distribution center.
I find out from the person that was scheduled to receive my package that it’s been marked delivered but they hadn’t received it.
I call UPS back and was told they shipped it, well I said you must’ve sent it to wrong address. They wanted another claim. At this point I don’t think I’m getting my package nor the value of it. This package wasn’t lost or stolen in my possession nor was it stolen after it was dropped off. IT WAS MISHANDLED OR STOLEN BY UPS EMPLOYEES."
"I needed a live person to discuss the problem but the automatic answering service gave the same speech and wouldn't connect me to a live agent. I had a delivery of live lobsters and since they said it would be delivered before 12:00 pm and I was going to be in dialysis, I said to put it on hold. Well, they said it was out for delivery and it is way past 12:00 pm, it is 6:30 pm and no one has attempted to deliver. Couldn't get a live person to help so I guess I'll pick up dead lobsters."
"As if yesterday's UPS fiasco wasn't enough (non-delivery because the driver didn't feel like it), I paid $107 to overnight by 10:30 am this morning. At near 4pm, it's still not here. I would have gotten more pleasure burning $107. I can't give these guys enough zeros."
"UPS is an irresponsible company that is not going to answer for its bad service. Lost packages, wrong deliveries and lousy support. Customer support is a dead line, claims have no answer.
They delivered my package to another person and they do not want to take responsibility and pay for the damage."
"Anthony C. In the Smithfield store was very helpful and knowledgeable.
We had an issue and he took the time to help us."
"Ups does not care about deliveries or people. My package that was supposed to be delivered to Florida was sent to Washington state. It is taking 2 weeks to get to me, if I receive it at all. I upgraded the package to ground and paid 20 and it did nothing to change the day. These are important part for a saltwater tank that the longer it takes to get them more damage will accure. I tried to call ups and it is such a aggravating process, it is almost impossible to talk to a human being and when you do they do nothing to help because it is policy to be inhumane (literally). They say I have to wait for the package to get delivered to request a refund for the upgraded delivery method from choice to ground."
"In the past few weeks, have had 7 different shipments sent to me. ALL 7 were late. Several went from West Sacramento to Sparks back to West Sacramento back to Sparks 2 or 3 times before finally moving beyond Sparks and on the way to my location.
If this were some rare annomily, I could forgive it. But it's the norm, not the exception.
When a package is shipped from 400 miles away and the package travels well over 1200 miles and takes 9 days to arrive; you have to ask the question: ""Who's the idiot in charge?"""
"Ordered a parcel that needed to be signed for. Got a delivery notification that is had been delivered to our recycling bin on bin collection day, very nearly lost the parcel"
this company needs to shut down. they have no clue how they are messing up with peoples important parcels.
Avoid! avoid avoid
"The UPS driver/courier, Gavin Andrews had to collect an incredibly heavy package, a windlass, an electric winch made of cast iron for a fishing boat, weighing around 120 lb or more. I haven't got the required printer for barcodes, so he made a brief phone call and his manager said make out a handwritten one, which Gavin did. I moved my van off the driveway so we could get through to the UPS van using my sack truck, but as I was doing that Gavin had lifted this phenomenally heavy package and was carrying 50 yards or more to the UPS van. All throughout he was cheerful, professional and REALLY wanted to help. I have never wanted to write a review about a courier before, but on this occasion a five star review is entirely justified. Thank you SO much Gavin and UPS. I am now a permanent UPS customer. David Evans.
Waybill no. 564 287 762 2 Courier Gavin Andrews at the Southampton depot."
"I've used UPS for some time, but over the last four months, the level of service has been terrible, with numerous problems. To make matters worse, their customer services department is hopeless. I've lost all faith in this company."
Quick delivery. On time. Delivery man polite and cheerful.
"Their website says ""you have questions, we have answers"". This is flat out a lie. Got put on hold by three different customer service reps who never answered my questions about a package I shipped. And they never even got back on the line. Rude bunch of liars with zero customer help."
Delivery went to a pickup location instead of delivery address.
"Dishonest company... late deliveries, overcharging... not collecting, not delivering on time... etc.
Utterly disgusting."
"UPS lost my package and refused to pay the replacement cost they make me lose 62% of the cost for the item they lost. Total Rip Off.

Don't use UPS."
"Package was clearly marked with the correct address, but the package was delivered 1 mile away at a different address. Thank God people know me and I received a call as to where it was. The address on the item was 102 hwy 200 and it was delivered to 122 hwy 200."
If zero stars was an option then that is what I would rate. Horrible experiences with UPS and my most recent one was mind boggling! Shipped 2 day delivery on the 27th of February. Today is the 13th of March. No delivery. I could go on about the excuses given such as my home is vacant as UPS drivers continue to show horrible service. My only advice is to save your sanity and peace of mind and use Fed Ex or USPS as I should have done. Sadly the names given for shipping options are just a name!!! Nothing more as I am told by a UPS worker. So thinking of sending a package quickly please heed my advice and do not use UPS!
They lost a very valuable package.... this is unacceptable. How can Amazon keep up with shipments but the largest shipping provider loses very valuable items. I'm very dissatisfied.
"Again be wary of EBay and zUPS delivery services no accurate tracking, no GPS tracking cannot retrace a de livery, so why use them useless."
"This is one of the worse delivery companies. First was 10th march, then 13th march. Now is 14th march delivery and I cant track my parcel!!"
The communication is just horrible! They say they gonna look into the matter and than nothing happens. I payed double for a Return Package and only with paypal I was able to solve that matter. I still need an invoice for that. Trying to get that for 2 Months now. The energy you have to give.. not worth it!!!!!!! Just pay a bit more with another company and be happy!
"I want to complain a racist in UPS !!!

Today I went to UPS store #7220 (Address: 20409 Yorba Linda Blvd Ste K2, Yorba Linda, CA 92886) to print a label for shipment and the woman in the picture, she printed all my labels wrong and asked me to pay for them. I refused to pay for the wrong labels and then she called me a f**king bit*h, go back to China and other racist words for a long time !!!!! When I was about to record a video, she immediately shut up. I want to file a complaint against this woman and post it on social media. The picture of this woman is below and her work address is UPS store #7220 : 20409 Yorba Linda Blvd Ste K2, Yorba Linda, CA 92886, It happened on 03/11/2023, around 16:30-16:40 (Los Angeles Time zone). Please check your camera monitor that I'm telling the truth !!!!! I am not at all at fault in this matter, but she is a complete racist for speaking out against others. If this is not handled properly, I will keep reporting and expanding on social media!!! I'm really mad !!!!!!!!

WHY DID YOU HIRE A RACIST GUY IN YOUR STORE??? THIS ACTIVITY WILL RUIN YOUR REPUTATION !!!!!! YOU WILL SEE !!!"
Paid for their next day delivery service which has been left unfulfilled without warning or reason.
"I order a face cream by behalf on one friend from Amazon UK, We paid extra 26.36 GBP or 29.80 euro to come fast at 10 March. Now we have 12 and we are still waiting."
"They never arrive. They just say something happened. Or just leave a note because they didn't want to wait for the customer to come out, and they never knock on the door."
Avoid the shipping company at all cost. You're lucky if your package EVER arrives.
"Still don’t have it , it supposed to be last Monday , but still some where"
"Within a span of 14 months, I have received 3 empty packages. I’ve lived in several areas across the country and have never experienced anything like this. The Tupelo crew collectively does not care about their customers experience, their customers property, or anything that would make a business successful. Dealing with UPS customer service is a joke. I would recommend using USPS or fedex."
"Horrible service.
They say that they came and nobody was here. That's a complete lie. Nobody came as I was here waiting for them to come. It's friday afternoon and now they say that they'll tey again on monday. They do not even give the option for me to go to one of their stores. That's the worst service I have ever seen. Please make yourself a favor and do not use this service."
"I have very bad experience with UPS. Their Online Customer service doesn't answer and always says to call again when you get your tracking number. This is lying and is not correct. They put a number just for making you mad.
Also, their UPS store does not answer your tracking order. I hate UPS."
Worst service i had in my life.Mexico is much better. They should hire chimpances they would do a better job. Never use this service even for free.
"Y’all the worse bruh . Who post an import fee at 2 am in the morning on their website but not send an email or even a text to the receiver because my info is attached to the parcel so i could be aware of it and can pay it on time who is up
2 am looking up ups packages and looking for fees at that time .. then send my package back to the US the same day you post the fee without informing me properly that there was a fee Of $34 for a tiny package . Y’all thieves . now my package that already was in Toronto is back in US when it suppose be here now y’all telling me Tuesday what sense that make so now the package have to travel all way back to Toronto y'all a joke I will never use y’all again any package that going thru y'all Im cancelling it ridiculous y’all deserve no stars at all"
For one thing they can get rid of their current manager at the Muskogee Oklahoma facility. He is rude and antagonistic. If UPS needs employees like him they are in bad shape. Plus they need to take a different approach to solving delivery issues. Its always the same old story. Give us the tracking number and we'll look into it. My latest encounter involved waiting for a package that did not arrive when scheduled. I took them 3 days and at least half a dozen calls to customer service and finally a threat to contact the CEO in Georgia.
"Man, UPS is an important part of the US economy, but they are really bad if you have a problem. It is impossible to talk to a real person - maybe or bot or some guy named Frank in Bangalore.

I had a package that was marked as delivered that my security video could prove was never delivered, but I ended up frustrated and just wrote of the $100 value product. I could do chat sessions all day long, but never get anywhere."
Ups is very unreliable I paid for a package to be delivered on a specific date for a very important occasion and now the package won’t make it there until 2 days later. Why guarantee and make some pay for a service that’s not guaranteed it way no delays they received package on time. Package was scan 10 hrs later at every stop this is unacceptable.
"Was at home all the day awaiting for my parcel, but UPS claimed “The receiver was not available for delivery.” This is absolutely 100% not true. In addition, if UPS really did make an attempt, they leave a sticker on the door stating this but of course they did not.

Guess the driver didn’t attempt to deliver my parcel, that’s just so comfortable do nothing and shift responsibility to the recepient. The driver never even approached the building. Pure lies…
Even the pick-up point address was a fake, Fuhrmannsgasse 1 is a residential building. I had to find myself the driver and carry by home the package myself. Moreover, the driver was an incredibly rude person.

It woud be better, if the company act with integrity instead of trying to place the blame for this situation on me “not being available.” I will definitely report UPS to the government for scamming, I paid for their services but they didn’t deliver."
Horrible service from a horrible company. Still says my package is on time even though it us already past the time expected and no reason given for being late.
"They didn't deliver the package they didn't offer insurance and they totally destroyed my daughters artwork. It never made it to Its destination they lied and said it was
They sent it back in horrible condition
Frame broken canvas ripped and box in pieces taped together. And all I am getting is the run around. This company sucks. And they are not even trying to make it right."
UPS has totally trashed 3 packages within a month. They have absolutely no respect for your property. Apparently they cannot hire anyone trustworthy or professional enough to handle packages
If i could give it 0 stars i could. I paid £10 for express delivery and it was flown out within a day but once given to UPS has been sitting in the warehouse for weeks. they said there was a problem with my address even though i had given the full address used for every other delivery ever. they dont even try to deliver to you and the customer helpline is horrible as its an automated voice message just saying “your package is on it’s way but no delivery date is available.” then they expect you to pick it up from the warehouse but its 40 miles away with no specific address and i paid a tenner for express delivery not collection? if you have something delivered by UPS just accept your parcel is never coming. horrible
"Ordered a Samsung All-in-One from BuyCoolGadgets off Newegg.
DID NOT KNOW UPS WAS TO ""DELIVER"".
If I had, I would never have ordered. So UPS claims it was delivered at the front door at 8:49 a.m. So many problems with this lie, but we'll keep it simple: Security for our apartment complex shows he WAS here at 8:49. At which point, he left his truck with two envelopes and entered the building.
Now, I'm not the most intelligent individual but I don't think you can fit a computer in an envelope.
Contacted both Newegg and BuyCoolGadgets. Surprise, surprise. They simply parotted what UPS said.
I will not lose any money this time, as I ordered using Affirm (they will take the hit). And I like Affirm, but not enough to pay $400 for nothing!
Lesson to be learned? FIND OUT WHO IS SHIPPING BEFORE ORDERING ANYWHERE."
"I wouldn't even give 1 star if I could. Kept losing personal information, delayed delivery, broken and missing items. Can't get hold of anyone to help you. Give them photographic proof the items are broken and email proof you've been trying to complain, but they don't have a record of it on their system even though you give them proof of the emails. Please don't give UPS your business."
Sent a stereo radio cassette and cd player. Packed very well obvious signs of the boxes being thrown and the corners were crushed in. After dismantling the Interior of the stereo had sustained major breakage. This was obviously mishandled and abused. Never again to use UPS
"After having many bad experiences with UPS (similar to all reviews below, where they claim the attempted delivery failed - even though I have front door camera 24/7 that can proof no one tried) - I selected this time the option to drop by the front door, no attendance needed. Even though I was at home… and guess what? Now they played a different trick. They delivered the package to the “front door”. But… of THEIR OWN PICKUP POINT 30km away! So the driver give the impression they formally delivered as instructed.

This is a joke. I couldn’t be as creative as that. To drop it by the front door of a random shop…

I don’t ever buy anymore in any webshop offering UPS. And I proactively give webshops feedback that, unless they change or add another logistics partner, I won’t be a customer."
"Disgusting. They actually got my package from a town outside of Shanghai to a town 1,5 hours form mine in Europe within 1,5 days, proceed to take 1 day just to ship it to my town, take it out to deliver to my and just don't show up and reschedule my package for a unknown date."
"Had a package delivered 8th March 2023. The box had a corner undone and when fully opened, 1 of the 4 items that was supposed to be in the box was missing. The sender confirmed that 4 items had been placed into the box so I informed customer service and got a reply from Melanie asking me to email a different address with full details. I did reply and today I get a response from Ana O, telling me how sorry she is and could I send images of the now disposed of cardboard box!! I told her that the box was now disposed of as at no point the day before was I asked to keep it as photographs would be needed.
I let Ana O know of this and was told that although I must be frustrated, there was nothing that could be done without the box.

Now I'm £50 out of pocket and someone within UPS (I did state that I didn't hold the delivery driver to blame) now has 1 of my items that I paid for and with the seller stating that 4 items were in the box, well and truly out of pocket!!

When I asked why nothing was mentioned the day before, Ana O just repeated how frusting I must feel, but this does not solve my particular problem.

Who in UPS has my goods??????"
"What a dreadful company, so far they have quote “mislaid “ four yes FOUR sets of Bose headphones. Customer service is shocking just as bad as Bose."
"Got my delivery ""delivered to mailbox"" but nothing arrived. Thought to check behind the corner where's same number of house for different street. Luckily their mailbox was broken and i was able to ""steal"" my slightly damaged parcel (quite a power was used to get it there) which was available for all to take in wrong address 24h+. Sent pictures and description to local delivery company who delivered it, didn't get even apologies but only delivery guys mobile number, seriously UPS, worse experience ever and couldn't believe it could even happen and of course first time in 8 years this address, got something delivered wrong place. If you use contractors in not very developed countries like Malta, you should guarantee their level of service somehow.... Happy that DHL operates here as well"
"They're not even trying to deliver it to me. IM HOME waiting for it, but they just take it to Access Point."
"You guys want to ruin my business if you don't deliever my package. I was supposed to receive 6 big boxes and just 3 was DELIEVERRD and Ups is saying it all DELIEVERED!! PLS THIS IS SO UNFAIR AND IM SAD.PLS Ups DELIEVER MY PACKAGE OR REACH OUT TO ME ASAP PLEASE!! HAVE TRIED TO CALL CUSTOMER CARE AND NO ONE IS TALKING TO ME. THE COMPUTER IS TELLING ME TO PUT MY TRACKING NUMBER, BUT SAYING IT BEEN DELIEVERED. PLS THIS IS A MARKET WORTH OF $40,000 I LIVE IN LEWISVILE TX 75067. ITS ALREADY A WEEK 03/02/23. The driver that brought the 3 boxes I told him it supposed to be 6 boxes and he said maybe another driver will bring it. Nobody brought it please. Help me this is what I feed on. I thought you guys are better than usps, PLS PROVE ME WRONG AND BRING MY MARKET TO ME PLS 🙏🙏"
"Very unhappy!
UPS was supposed to pickup a package for an Amazon return. They didn't. All they did was to leave a label & excepted the package to be dropped off at a UPS Store
I can't do that. I am disabled. That is why I asked for a UPS pickup in the 1st place."
"We awaited a package that required a signature. We were in our small house. We waited at home all day. At 6 pm I want to the door to find a note UPS attempted delivery. I’ve no idea how as we were here and tested our doorbell. The note said to go get the package. We tried to call- it costs $30 more to pick up the package. Certainly not good customer service. No idea if we will ever see or package or when. You can’t call or chat with ups unless you create a profile and account.
I’ll just report it as undelivered to the merchant and dispute the charges with the credit card. Basically UPS is incapable of delivering when signature is required"
I was driving about 5 hours on a donut spare tire in arkansas. The ups truck driver behind me was the only vehicle that did not try to pass me or seem to be frustrated with my slower than normal speed. I wish I could've said ty to him for showing consideration and not making me feel like I was in his way.
"The usual crap service from UPS.
Once again out for delivery then come 6pm it's not."
"Do not use UPS ever
They have fobbed me off and lied directly to me for months. They now claim I cannot retrieve my parcels as too much time has passed.
They know were the parcels are but have abandoned them. £18k worth of goods abandoned. We may lose our business over this.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
"Shipment was 3 days late, fees were outlandish, electronic tracking update was worthless…NEVER AGAIN"
I wish I could give no stars customer service is hell employees are taking packages or loosing them how do you loose a love seat two chairs and a end table it's sad I'm really pissed off I want my stuff and a refund at this point I waited long for my stuff when I got Expedite shipping then u try to call customer services there's nothing they can do and that's if you can get a hold of a live agent this is so sad this company is so sad
"For the most part I have had excellent experiences with UPS. I have had dozens and dozens of packages shipped overnight express from the same sender to me for 3 years now. However, I've had to take issue with my shipments recently, which are always the extremely urgent overnight envelopes. The driver didn't even come into our building or call so they could deliver it to my apartment, where I am always present since we work from home. They just stuck a pickup notice at the front entrance to the building and my online tracking said that they tried to make contact but no one was home, which was a lie. So that meant I had to take $25 round trip uber ride to the UPS store because the driver couldn't have been bothered to call me or take an elevator up to drop off the envelope.

And then today, it was getting to be 5:30pm and they still hadn't shown up so I called customer service who GUARANTEED me multiple times that it would be delivered before end of day. Then later I received another bogus update saying ""We missed you. We are taking your package to a local UPS Access Point™ next business day for customer pickup."". AGAIN, this time I waited in the lobby for the guy to show up but simply nobody came by. So, they didn't ""miss me"" again, they never even showed up and now they're dropping it off at a UPS Store again where I have to spend another $25 and 45 minutes off of work to go pick up my package. And it warrants mentioning again that these were both extremely urgent overnight shipping options, but these drivers made it take as long as possible and that should be absolutely intolerable in a business with a global giant like UPS.

I spoke to customer service the morning after it wasn't delivered and he told me that I had to pick it up from the UPS store because the driver ""had already made a delivery attempt and so he would have to change his route and delay the package by ANOTHER day!!

Somehow they can it from British Columbia to Kitchener overnight, but it takes two days to make it the last 15 minute drive."
I have never had a good experience with ups. Either Always late or missing altogether
"My package was delivered to a location I did not request and did not prefer. UPS delivery trucks are in and out of our apartment complex multiple times a day, but of late, they don’t seem to understand that there is a code given to all delivery services. If I were able to easily go out to get what I need, I would not order things to be delivered. Even when a driver actually calls, he/she doesn’t understand to put a pound sign first - and that’s after explaining to enter the pound sign first. And, upon calling, the complaint was passed off as unimportant. If I could give a zero rating, that’s what UPS would receive."
"Wish I could give 0 stars. Ordered something 3 weeks in advance, said it would be here by last Friday, and now the package is lost. I then proceeded to order overnight shipping on the same package for 30$ because this was needed by yesterday latest and it’s now not going to be here for another day. I have tried numerous times to speak with someone and I can’t even get a real person on their line."
"UPS is the worst delivery company! I have all my worst experience in receiving packages with this company. I HAVE UPDATED MY DELIVERY OPTION TO LEAVE IT IN FRONT OF DOOR, I HAVE CONTACTED THEM AND STILL NO CHANGES. NO DELIVERY PERSON ACTUALLY TRIED TO DELIVER MY PACKAGE!!!"
Making me jump through one hoop after another to get a claim paid for item they have clearly lost (tracking clearly shows no delivery).
Terrible and stupid automated system that won’t let me speak to an agent or gets my words either. They need to work hard to improve their service.
"I was trying to get more details about a package thar was delivered to a locker. Called their 1-800 number. Couldn't get to speak to a human. The machine was not a ble to understand the tracking number and when you type using keypad, there is no translation for letters. It just went in circles without offering an opportunity to speak to a human."
"Rubbish ass delivery company. You stay home and they lie that you weren’t and they couldn’t deliver your package and send it to God knows where?! Messed up. Everyone should stop using UPS, maybe they’ll be more accountable and efficient. This has happened on several occasions"
"Awful awful awful.
Rude staff.
Bad service.
Don't normally write reviews as not ""that guy"" but felt obligated too. That's how bad the experience is."
Pathetic useless customer services who lie to get you off the phone. Time slots that are never met. I used to thin Hermes/EVRI were the worst but these guys are just as bad AVOID like the plague
Sometimes when you are trying to buy a label from.ups it's taking money for labels you are not getting when the server crashed but they will take the money and you don't have no tracking number or label this keeps on happening then you have to go for a long process to provide evidence that you tried to buy a label the system needs to change this happens when you don't use the app how long does it please check your bank accounts people as when you are sometimes trying to do a label and it doesn't go through your try again thinking it hasn't taken your money but sometimes it has
"I so hate UPS! Especially the Thailand branch. I ordered two smartphones for personal use, and they seized them and required me to provide the NBTC import license. Just for 2 phones, really? Like Im gonna sell tons of them. The process of getting a license is complicated and unobvious. They do not explain all steps of the process, always have some new requirements and hidden fees, and can not answer my questions. I will NEVER work with UPS again! Just stay away from them."
Omg they dont attempt delivery. Amazon is gaining market share because UPS service is terrible
"SCAMMERS , stolen 3 packages , Thiefs"
"Their customer service is one of the most disorganised I’ve ever experienced. The individuals I spoke with on the phone were friendly enough and tried to be helpful, but it’s clear the overall management and leadership at UPS is absolutely horrible. It took me 2 hours (!!!) of phone calls to get the help I needed. I would call their general customer service, they would ask me for my tracking number, etc, and after all that would transfer me to another department. Then I’d have to explain the same situation yet again (that the package I’ve sent using UPS Express has gone missing and there are no tracking updates whatsoever). Then that department would tell me I need to “file a claim” online and asks me for my email address so she can send me a link (don’t you have my email already if I just gave you my tracking number?). Instead of helping to fill out a claim for me through the phone I now needed to do this myself through the email link which is fine.

I click the link and (because clearly UPS doesn’t check to see if their website pages are working correctly or updated) I’m not able to select the option “Sender”. The only option available to click is “Receiver”, even though I am the sender of the package. Also, my problem isn’t listed under the “Select reason for claim” list. All kinds of issues are listed there, but not the simple option of “Missing package”. So I’m not able to file the claim correctly. Then I had to call them back yet again and explain that the the claims page wasn’t working correctly (because of said issues). They then ask me to call the technical department. Instead of just transferring me, give me the number instead. I write down the number and call the tech department. Long story short, they weren’t able to help me and I had to call regular customer service back again and explain the whole damn situation yet again, as well as giving him my tracking number yet again. Thankfully, this guy was friendly and helped me out. He helped file a claim for a missing package through the phone, and said I should be contacted within 24 hours through phone or email.

I thanked him for his patience, and immediately after the phone-call I’m asking myself “Why am I thanking him for HIS patience, when I have just been on the phone for literally 2 hours, trying to get the help I need for my missing UPS Express package.” Shaking my head haha.

Let's see if they contact me. Again, I chose the UPS Express option (which is close to $40) because I wanted my package, a large envelope with a gift, long letter and a birthday card, to reach a friend in the U.S. on time for his birthday. 6 days later there’s been no update on tracking and I don’t even know if it’s left my country (Netherlands). So I paid for Express shipping and not only has it clearly not arrived on time for his birthday, it appears it hasn’t even left my country yet.

Long story short: One of the most disorganised customer service experiences I’ve had, also one of the most exhausting. If they were well organised this issue could have been solved in 10 minutes. Again, I spent literally 2 hours on the phone trying to get the help I needed. It’s quite outrageous. Unless I truly had no other choice, I will never ship anything with UPS again. Last time for me.

Comical update: After all the effort mentioned, after I thought the guy had helped file a claim for me over the phone, I was indeed contacted. And guess what? I received an email asking me to: Fill out a claim online. (I literally face-palmed). The very reason I needed his help to fill out a claim in the first place was because of technical issues on their website. But, it gets worse.

I called customer service yet again, and thankfully got the guy who helped me earlier. I explained what had happened and he also sighed (so it's clear some UPS employees are also aware of how horrible this company is). He's helping me through the phone, and the line is disconnected from his end. I call back again (and go through the call menu for the 50th time) and am connected with one of his colleagues. I asked if she could patch me through to him (gave his name) so I wouldn't have to explain the whole situation again. She says she's unable to. She does get a ""case code"" from him, and then asks me to repeat (for literally the 20th+ time today) my info.

My friend and I lost contact (lost phone and no social media), which is why I sent a letter (had his address). The letter which I shipped with UPS Express. The letter which UPS has now lost.

I receive an email asking for my info for a manual claim. Fill out everything except for his number/email (which I obviously don't have). I can give my alternative email so she can fill something in.

Received a new reply from a new customer service rep and she says *drumroll*:
“I am so sorry to hear you have no contactdetails by phone or email.
Maybe you can write him a letter to ask for it."""
"I shipped 2 different products on Mercari. UPS takes 3 days just to get your package out of your state. In this case, it's CA. My packages have been sitting in a L.A. hub since Friday. Not sure why? FedEx and the USPS get your package to it's destination much faster. From now on, I will use FedEx or the USPS."
"No reason to pay for express shipping when UPS is just gonna sit on your package for several days in the next town over but tell you you’re not allowed to come to the shipping center to pick it up until they’ve attempted delivery, whenever that is. Now I’m worried what the condition of my 300$ package is going to be, when they do feel like delivering it…"
"UPS is usually good, but it is absurd they charge you $6 to hold your package at a UPS store. I could understand paying to hold it at a CVS or other store, but paying to hold it a UPS store is a perverted money grab by a subpar package company.
They failed 2/3 attempts to deliver and did not even try to use the call box at the door to contact me. UPS drivers have no incentive to try harder because UPS works their employees hard and burns them out. Go to FedEx or DHL or somewhere else."
"Why do they keep saying that they are ""trying to get the security access our driver needs for this delivery."" There is no security access needed, this gate is always open, and every time they can't make it they show the same message! UPS is full of it... I don't understand why companies keep using them! Sometimes when I will purchase online, and checking out I see that the carrier is UPS, I try to find the product somewhere else! Because this keeps happening often... they are so not reliable!"
"destroyed my parcel, not even a phone call or a door tag. shipper sent it again, now it's stuck in transit saying ""address needs updating"" again not even a phone call. if they count their customers property as worthless then they should get out of the business altogether"
I paid extra for 2nd day air shipping to still recieve my package 4 days later....
They suck they act like people never miss a scan sorry I literally did this job people miss scans all the time just say you lost the package
Trash ass company..FedEx will always be superior. Slow shipping and customer service is a nightmare
Had a package to be delivered March 3rd. Spoke with seven Cs one even called me to confirm that my address is updated and the driver will deliver 0303. Only to find out at the end of the day my address was not updated. Spoke to 7 useless CS yesterday. To avoid speaking to 7 lunatics today I told the CS to just put a note I will pick my pack myself . The most useless bunch of CS. My tracking still say address needs to be updated.
"My last tracked package was on 2/13/23. But we’ve had 6 more UPS packages arrive. None of which tracked through our PAID MyChoice account! I even entered the 1Z UPS number MyChoice couldn’t find any package.
After calling today, speaking (being transferred to) several different people. Some I just couldn’t understand.
Being told erroneously that our account was no longer active! By Tech Agent Kiran, allegedly a Tech support agent. He was the fourth (4th) agent I spoke with.
Got “accidentally” disconnected.

I repeatedly tried to explain after an order was made in the past and a UPS LABEL CREATED on UPS MyChoice like magic the 1Z label would show up on our MyChoice APP. We could follow our packages, make sure our young lab pups were safely indoors.

It was like they did not understand 🤷🏻‍♀️
I finally called back again and explained to a very polite soft spoken and apologetic (that was nice!) Joe.
I swear I got nauseous when Joe said he was going to transfer me back to the “Universal Department” … I said “don’t leave me Joe!!!” “JUST WHEN I GET A SMART PERSON! Someone I can understand AND who understands what I AM SAYING!!!”
He said he’d stay on the phone. If he did he heard the rudest of them all.

JOE - 3:05pm PT
Joe was awesome out of everyone. Sent me to Kiran who said he knew how to help.
But he didn’t. After I gave him a package that is already here and of course it showed delivered. But like I told him, we could NEVER follow it.
I found a package coming. Gave that number to him. It showed up when he put the tracking numbers in his search. It’s due at my door on Monday.

I said “Ok, now I’ll put them in my MyChoice APP”. No package exists (or words to that effect )

He was flustered. I told him if things aren’t coming through like they used to, yet our private information is out there and a credit card, how am I supposed to feel good about this?
He once again reiterated I could track packages on UPS.com!!!!

What finished off the conversation for me was when he asked “how did you put the APP on your phone in the first place?”
I told him a very nice UPS Agent explained it to me. She took me to the UPS website where there was a link to the APP. It could be a free version or a Paid version.

I asked him if he knew about the APP?
Or how to maybe UPDATE it?

He was so nasty suddenly. I asked for his supervisor he said he doesn’t have one! (SERIOUSLY! I said no employee number noting?) He said no.
I said “so your just Kiran at 3:05pm PT?”

He was going to explain AGAIN how I could track my packages at UPS.COM! 😡 I told him I didn’t pay for the APP to be treated like I was ignorant.
He should know about the APP, or be trained in it! I said I couldn’t take the conversation anymore. No one knew anything! And I disconnected the call. He was so angry and dismissed of me. Kept saying I could use UPS.com. Not addressing my APP not working.
UPS pays these people to NOT be trained, so customers are left dangling 🤷🏻‍♀️
The drivers do a great job.
I only hope Joe in customer service was taping the conversation.
Because he actually seemed concerned about all I had gone through.

Honestly don’t know what to do. Because I see it’s happening to other people too.
This is awful. Where’s their pride in their work? Where’s the accountability?
Horrible service. UPS needs to hire all our US computer school graduates. So many go to computer schools here in the United States and would LOVE a job like Kirans.
They’d treat the customers a LOT nicer and actually know how to do their jobs!"
"This is day three of waiting on this inept delivery driver. UPS provides a tracking tool (TT) with updates. After sitting all day on Monday waiting for this package, I checked the TT and read a notification was ""recipient unavailable"". So I called the call center.(cc) The interaction with their cc left me believing the distribution center dispatcher (dcd) would be calling me back within the hr. Didnt happen. Tuesday, same bs. All day wait. Notification this time... ""driver needs security gate code for delivery."" Strange as I have no security code on my driveway. Same routine with call center, called them at 4pm, says dcd callback within the hr. Called again at 5:30... same message. Didnt happen. No call from the dcd. There are so many things wrong here. Throughtout all of this, there is no ETA provided on their tracking tool messages... so you are stuck waiting ALL DAY. The illusion of concern with a TT that is marginally effective at providing information. No concern for the recipient, as in no phone call to rectify the problem despite 3 attempts on my part. A delivery driver who must not know how to use a gps or google maps. Other delivery companies (Amazon, Fedex) have not had this level of incompetence at package delivery. Due to their ineptitude I have been held captive at home for going on 3 days. So yeah, UPS SUX.(edit)... end of day 3, TT message ""Uncontrollable events have delayed delivery."" Oh and end of day 2, if they were in a situation needing a gate code why didnt they call me to get it? Who else were they gonna get it from?"
"My experience is great ,I have a wonderful ups guy.I don't understand the low reviews on here,I get my stuff every month with care ,friendly service right to my door and even brings my dog treats.im satisfied."
"MUST READ THIS REVIEW
UPS IS THE WORST COMPANY RVER!!!! I would give it 0 stars if it allowed me.
I Needed to ship packages. I called customer service to ensure that the driver is coming to my door on the 2nd floor to pick up my packages and there is no elevator, I was told “yes” by Tega, based on that I scheduled a pick up. In the morning of the pick up I received a call from a dispatcher, her name was Media, tells me that I need to bring the packages to 1st floor, they are not a shipping company and drivers are not allowed to pick up from upper floors if there no elevator! I called customer service and got to Ervin who assured me that I do not need to bring anything down or reschedule the pickup and a driver will come to my door to pick up my packages, been back and forth between dispatcher saying ‘pick up won’t occur from 2nd floor’ and customer service reps ( Sam who told me to ignore dispatcher’s calls, Austin, Nadin, Sarah and 2 others who didn’t get their names) who assured that it will occur from my door, all day from 9:40 am to 9:15 pm, no one came to pick up the packages and customer service keep telling me we escalate the situation and someone will call you, I wait and no one calls me.
Finally I spoke to a couple of supervisors (Kasheka G, John and Sophia), they refused to refund the pick up money because their system mentions an attempt was made and packages were not ready! Which never happened!!!!! The cameras by the building door shows no attempts, their system said that I was told to bring the packages down and I didn’t but they ignored the 50 customer service reps who assured me that a driver will pick up my packages from my door, their only option was to schedule another pick up, pay another amount of money, and bring the packages myself downstairs!!!!!!!"
"I’m not a UPS customer and never will be. A UPS driver who was delivering a package to a neighbour hit my vehicle, leaving my driver side completely damaged to the point where my driver side door won’t even open, resulting in me not being able to drop my son to nursery or for me to get to work, resulting in me not getting paid! The driver left a note on my windscreen with no relevant information on the actual note. The driver said they logged the incident with UPS and when I call it will be resolved. I called the number which was an automated number which also charges by the minute! I finally found a number where I could actually speak to a human on the other end, who told me a complaints form will be filled out and passed onto the complaints department. I had to call UPS 10 times in total to even get to this stage. I understand there’s a process in place but your driver could have at least left their registration plate so I could log this with my insurance company. I now currently have a car I cannot access, I can’t take my son to nursery that I pay over £100 a day for and I can’t get to work meaning I won’t get paid. Extremely poor process in place, I was told 3 times on the day I will get a call back in 2 hours, yet I had to call an additional 3 times for further assistance. I have work in a similar industry and I know when an accident like this takes place it should all be logged within the company and can easily be accessed when a customer complaint comes through. I will be claiming all the money from the damage to my car, along with my son’s nursery fees and my loss of earnings from work. Absolute useless company with absolute useless staff"
"UPS does not respect its money-back guarantee. I sent a packet with the guarantee and it arrived too late. I should have get my money back. After exchanging emails for many months, they finally agreed to give money back but six months later I never receive anything.

They have the worst customers support ever."
"Absolutely shocking service.2 delivery attempts in 2 days and nothing received.these drivers are scared to deliver in residential locations.they want a big industrial building that they can see in plain site to drop and run.
UPS need to rethink their strategy
Delivery updates are shocking,there’s no system to notify when a parcel is actually arriving.reassurance with a customer is zero"
"UPS is the most useless delivery company, I don't even know how are they still functional, a small restaurant makes more better deliveries that this stupid service."
"I am more then upset . On 28th I get a call that a part of address is missing. I sent this information way before via email. Guess no one reads them. Driver wanted to deliver without notice. I was not at home but at working! I had to call 3 times to scheduled a New delivery but it never arrived till today and no notifications although I put it in the system! I need this very very important package 20kg, payed 200.-, still don’t have it, although it was said to be delivered on Thursday 2nd. Agents are nice but inefficient. They say yes we correct the address,( had to say this over and over again as well) , yes it will be delivered on scheduled day, NADA. Nothing is in the system again ! What the are they doing ? NEVER Use UPs AGAIN !"
"Package lost. Customer service is lousy! Called several times, sent emails, file the claim, Facebook messenger, live chat, tried everything and nobody actually is taking ownership to help investigate the case."
"I wouldn't be leaving a review it I'd only had one or two incidents, but these guys mess up so often that I'm shocked when they actually get it right. Today they've lost an expensive drone that was on the way. Only after I waited around all day yesterday for them to deliver it. Now instead of focusing on fixing their business model, they're more interested in political activism. That's the reason I sold all my shares in them, and why I always, ALWAYS pay extra to have it shipped via FedEx."
"First off This should be a 0 star review. I order important parts for my vehicle from another company witch used UPS. This is seriously 100+ times my pagages are ruined or, destroyed. This company really needs to monitor there employee's and pagages on trucks and make there employee's pay out of there paycheck everytime someone's spends hard earned cash to purchase and ship any items that are destroyed. You are a multi billion dollar company and the bs we half to go threw to first track the item - items and pay out of are pockets for your service and then half to deal with the stuck on stupid customer services reps is ridiculous. It doesn't stop because you need to make extra steps and protocols to ensure are merchandise is protected and delivered in a timely manner and if your driver destroyies merchandise because they are lazy and don't like there job and they half to pay for it guarantee it will stop.. Thanks again for destroyed products that I need to fix my vehicle so, I can provide for my family in this expensive economy. You guys should be put out of business and, anyone who uses your service be aware of this company's lack of morrals and lack of respect for are merchandise."
"I didn't even have a problem with UPS or my delivery but just needed additional info and the way my request was handled made me separate myself from UPS where ever I can.
I was trying to reach out to get some more information about my delivery.
I called the phone number and asked their automated answering machine to put me in contact with agent. It said it can't until I give more information.
I provided more information and it did not give me what I needed, so I asked to be put in contact with an agent again. The answering machine said an agent can't help on this topic, go on our website, and then hung up on me.
I tried their live chat feature and it immediately disconnected and retrying was not helpful.
I never had issues with their drivers or my delivery but I know if I ever do have issues, there will be no one to help so better to stay away than take the risk."
We received a package yesterday and on the tracking it said it was left at our front door which was incorrect the driver apparently pulled up to the end of my driveway got out stuffed it in a snowbank and drove away. UPS response when I called to complain was I will put a note in the file apparently that will solve everything would give zero stars if it was a possibility.
"I received a package via UPS from Germany. Odlo was the merchant. Apparently, enroute and upon package's arrival into their (UPS') Louisville, KY. main hub, the appropriate docs or paperwork wasn't available and caused a day's delay. The package was visibly ripped and poked with numerous holes. My suspicion is that their designated customs search or process to yield the import package's document. So they just started gouging up the package to gain inside of it. One item's missing now, and so I filed a UPS claim to get reimbursed. It's such an arduous process. Dealing with their obstinate customer service people. Of course, they have to contact the shipper first to blame them. I've been trying to fulfill their 7 photo's requirement, so they can't automatically deny me on the claim per the UPS policy. Normally, I don't have issues with UPS as a carrier, however, good luck if you have a legitimate claim! No responsibility taken whatsoever. UPS customer service people are worse for what they get paid. The claim process goes on and on. Count on 8 - 10 days minimum."
terrible customer service handling a customs credit of 356.01 canadian dollars for a parcel that was lost by driver been waiting since jan 9th for a credit that takes 2 minutes to do multiple case numbers nobody can give answers very fast to take the money when needed but good luck trying to get your credit march 2nd and still waiting my email adress tracking number 1zw1933x6772594811
"UPS did not deliver my package. They showed up a full day early and when I was not at home, said that I now have to pick it up at the auto parts store in town. However, when I went to the parts store, my package was not there. The parts store said I have to come back again tomorrow to check, but they could not give me a time. I am fully displeased."
"Very valuable shipment to my UK address required completion of a UK customs form. I completed this while speaking on the phone with a UPS customs specialist in their Manila call center, who confirmed receipt. Next day I received a message saying customs information had not been received, so I went through the process again with another Manila call center UPS agent. Then I received a message from UPS saying delivery would be the next day. Another day went by and I received yet another message UPS saying they were going to charge me GBP 13 per day for holding the shipment while they awaited the required customs information. So, I phoned them again and was transferred to someone at UPS USA (maybe UK). This agent told me the shipment had been returned from Stansted UK back to Louisville, but she should not tell me why and said I needed to speak with the shipper. The shipper was then on the phone with UPS for 90 minutes trying to work out what was going on. UPS eventually told the shipper the item was being returned because I had not supplied the UK customs information. Crazy, as I have two copies of the customs forms along with the email addresses of the UPS agents to who they were transmitted. I paid for three day delivery, over $100 for a very small package. Will this be refunded? UPS obviously has systems problems. It is difficult to know what to do next.

UPDATE: UPS really does have serious communication and systems problems. When all was said and done, UPS USA told me the UK Customs forms I had submitted twice needed to come from the shipper not the recipient (me). Yet the shipper was never contacted, only me. How can UPS mess up on such a basic procedure? Then, when the shipment was on the way back to the shipper, USP told me they could not work with me, only with the shipper, as there was now a new tracking number. Now we have to start all over again -- two weeks now having passed, and I paid for 3-day delivery."
Ups is late too often; they give you a time and the driver is eating lunch and not delivering packages on time. Whose to blame!? All of them. And driver was rude when I asked him how to complain! Not what it used to be.
"Horrible and shiet service, last minute change that we are not delivering today."
"1 star is to much for this absolute disgracefull company, no notification of when the order is coming, then demamds money when the order comes to deliver!

without any time to prepare, also the driver stunk of vodka !

absolute disgrace!"
"Not only the worst coustomer service but the worst courier service I've ever shipped with. My girlfriend has send documents from Kenya to Germany. The documents are laying in Köln for more than two weeks now. I've called the coustomer service in Germany, my girlfriend called and visited them in Kenya. Nothing happens. The guy from coustomer service told me 3 days ago someone will call me the next day. Nothing. They have my email, my phone number but they don't do a sh.t. I have been traveling to Germany only for the purpose to recieve these documents and process them here. It is embarrassing like sh.t."
UPS is just not what it used to be. Recently my order was lost. I have received items lately that have been broken in shipping. My orders frequently come in torn/ripped boxes. Yesterday I received my neighbor’s order. It is getting ridiculous. I am tired of having to reorder items that have been lost and damaged.
"I swear I hate UPS this company shouldn’t be in business they claim that my order was delivered to my address but I was home all day and nothing was delivered, asking to make a claim why can’t I just have my order what’s going on"
"I checked the package an it stated it was in Davenport (which is 3 miles from my house) on Sunday the 26th.
The 27th came and no delivery in fact there was a UPS truck on my street (there is 20 houses on my street) and he said he did not have my delivery.
Now its the 28th and again another UPS truck passes my house but no delivery.
I contacted UPS and they said it was scheduled on Monday the 27th but was left at the building.
So I asked what about today and he had not answer.
But they are going to have the UPS depot call me tomorrow at 16:00 (which means I will not get my package tomorrow). Worst delivery company"
"Ups is the WORST!!
Always and i mean ALWAYS turning in packages days almost weeks after they're due. Such a disappointment of a service."
Worst ever. Tracking is horrible. So far Amazon has the best tracking. UPS should take lessons from Amazon
"Impossible to get to speak to someone. All automated. Which is fine for those who couldn’t be bothered to lookup the information otherwise. But for someone like me who avoids speaking to reps and rather get the info online, it’s a shame UPS has built a system that makes it almost impossible."
"In My openion,”The Worst customer service EVER.UPS picked up my parcels worth ‘$600 from my house and lost them both.It’s been a run around since then.They asked me about a dozen time to fill a claim and when you call,the next person has no idea what you are talking about.Finally did the claim on line.They sent a letter to fax or main.Decided to mail by Registered Mail.Yesterday received the mail back.
WRONG ADDRESS!!!!!!
UNBELIEVABLE.."
Idiotic system. Can't sign in because it doesn't accept my user name password. Won't send me an email to reset. Called TECH SUPPORT and they can't fix it either after spending a half an hour on the phone. Can't unenroll and reenroll. They are outdated and waste people's time!!
If I could leave 0 stars I would delivery terrible you can’t speak to a representative either Amazon best way to go
"This company frequently missing or damage everthing.Please change personal or change your policy.This company is garbage, need total change."
"Big thumbs up to Glen from Newhaven, always on time and a great service, thanks."
Complete ineptitude. Kept asking me the same informations over and over again. Package never arrived. waste of time and money.
They always deliver packages so late like it’s super annoying coz why would I order something else a week after I placed an order with UPS and that package still got delivered before theirs like whyyy!!! And it happens all the time!
On 2/22/23 placed a online order thru a company paid for over night. Basically next day. Bad weather hit on the 23rd. Understand delays but here it is 2/27/23 and still nothing. Received tracking update reading it was out for delivery on the 27th. 30 min. Later a text came thru reading basically we have no clue when we will deliver. No refund. Ouch.
"I bought an item from Ferfetch online. It didn’t fix on me, so I dropped off my package sealed with a label return on Mon Feb 13. When the package came to Miana UPS store, They emailed me: the package was damaged and empty, so the shipper (Farfecth) said they couldn’t do anything and won’t refund.
I just double checked with ups store #5590 in escondido today where i dropped off my package. and I told them know the reason. THey checked the camera and they saw the guy sealed my package already, so it wasn’t damaged in the store when I gave to them.
Nothing wrong when I dropped off my package in the store. How can I claim?"
I would give their customer service negative 100 stars if I could. Impossible to get in contact with their customer service
"Very bad company. I will never trust ups again. My package was not delivered, two of the three boxes were returned, the third was damaged and all the contents were lost. I lost a lot of money due to bad ups. Use other more reliable companies.
I want to add. A couple of days later I went there again and asked if I was entitled to compensation, I lost 400 dollars. I just laughed in my face."
"UPS is a dogcrap company. This company has a horrible email system, & a crappy customer service based in Asia somewhere. They send bogus bills to customers, who haven't used their services for months, & then they continue to bill people after closing their accounts. It's all completely illegal, & this company shouldn't even exist anymore. It's like talking to a con over the phone, who claims that they can't do anything to help you, but they still have your name, your address & your email on file in order to continue sending you bills for absolutely nothing. They hire these people in Asia because when a pissed off customer calls in to figure out what the hell is going on, then they can just throw them around in circles. I'm not a nice person when I'm just lied to, nor can I put up with the heartache of hearing bullcrap over the phone. I lose sleep over dealing with lowlife companies like UPS. Screw them! Stop employing migrates workers with limited resources across the world because you don't want to pay Americans to do the job anymore. It's just wrong... I get so sick of yelling at people that just read off of a script~ I'm getting another bill for something that I didn't even order, & I closed my account. I'm going to find out what is going on, & I'm going to put an end to it! With as much money as UPS is charging for shipping, they can shove it all up their you know what!

Give your drivers some air-conditioning!"
"Worst company ever had misfortune to deal with, driver said I had to pay import duty but I had email proof of payment, received a letter saying I owed x number of pounds then 7 days later I received 2 letters saying I was in credit .2 months later I received another letter for different amount of debt .when you phone its all foreign call centre staff who are hard to understand."
"Epic fail. Avoid at all costs.

Lost my package, wouldn’t deliver my package - you name it. Filed a claim? I did it wrong because I didn’t provide enough information about something being shipped to me. Contact the company? Near impossible and both times I got through to ‘assistance’, they had children playing and talking in the background. So obviously they didn’t actually care about my problem and someone named Brittany was assisting me poolside from her home. Everything was customer and shipper fault. Nothing UPS responsibility. Closed my original claim without even notifying me. Thankfully I kept contacting to try and have SOMEONE help me. Had to reopen. Nothing UPS told me matched what was on my delivery information. Different story every time and they basically read to me what’s on the app or tracking number. Ridiculous. I aged five years dealing with these yahoos. Don’t bother. Seriously. Use any other company for shipping."
"How this company is still going with such poor rating is amazing, I would personally give it a minus rating if possible, I have been waiting over a week for my delivery, first it went to the wrong town where is sat for three days then to another city, no updates on the track and trace, and when you call customer services they can’t talk you anymore, and advice you to use the track and trace. At this rate it would be quicker for me to go and collect it. Terrible service and would never use personally."
I know I’m throwing another 1 star on a massive pile. If the package is remotely time sensitive don’t ship with UPS/Fliway. The packages are usually 1-2 weeks late and the customer service isn’t helpful.
Ups is very annoying. They never deliver my package on time. They keep changing delivery date. There is a time when I went to their office to get my package. Their driver falsely report as if they attempt to deliver but no body home. They could have dropped in the loby or outside the building since my packages do not require signature.
"worst experience ever. my parcel was supposed to deliver on 2nd Feb but they just sent me ""we tried to deliver to you but, if you are able to pay the import fees otherwise we will not deliver, I paid 123$. then they just updated the status that they have delivered the parcel, but when I checked all over the building there was no parcel. For the last 20 days, I'm trying to claim then also they are not helping me to find out my parcel. now, i will never recommend ups to anyone its the worst courier service"
"The driver attempted delivery of a wine shipment that required an adult signature. We left a note at the door to have next door neighbor sign for the package. The driver left a note he could not do that. I rescheduled shipment for today, Saturday, 25 February. I waited the entire day and after 7:00 pm, received a message that there was an attempted delivery; false! No one came, no note was left and I have a security system to prove it! It’s a shame that not only are they incapable of timely delivery but are also dishonest."
The UPS website is not up to date on the location of my package. The Auto-Agent on the website was not helpful in locating my package. Finally I was able to talk to a person after getting through another useless Auto-Agent on the phone. The live person in the Philippines said my package was in a town next to mine and was delayed due to weather. It has been sunny all week and my package will be a week late. UPS just blames the weather for their failure to deliver a package on time. I will not order from vendors who use UPS. UPS is terrible.
"My package was scheduled for delivery on 2/24. UPS delivery man did not ring bell but put""Sorry we missed you” sticker on door. I have called customer service and they lied about the time. This is day 2 I am furious that they doing the same thing again. I still have no package and several calls later the lie continue and the time for delivery has changed. I hate UPS"
"They gave incorrect estimate on delivery time of package with signature requirement. I stepped out and for a bit and missed them by 20 minutes, called immediately for a second delivery attempt. Claimed they would contact the driver and call me back. Never did either. No way to pick the package up or get a redlivery for 2 days now."
I would give them a minus 5 if there was a way. Out of all the packages I receive ups is the ONLY a place that will tell you it’s been delivered and no proof other than their word!(even if you have cameras proving they were a no show) Then you will go through a two week and one day process before they will decide to actually give your money back then wait a month for that. I do not buy from any company that says they ship with ups well this one didn’t have them listed so my expensive rugs are in some drivers house as we speak! Wtw!And if you pay 6 dollars you can pick up at an access point I feel like it’s the only way to get your things like a scam!
"Worst experience I’ve ever had, my package was supposed to be delivered on Friday. It got to their location on Saturday and they said that the wouldn’t be opening the trailer until Monday or Tuesday. Ups has ruined a crucial package that we need for our road trip. I called coustkmer service and they said suck it up. Worst company ever!!"
"UPS...Utterly Pure S41t...

I didn't choose the...shipper did

why couldn't they just use the Post Office?"
UPS is the worst at delivering packages too the correct address. I will never do any business with them again
"It's just baffling to me that this company does every single thing to take short cuts from over working drivers, to have customer service representatives that can't answer very simple questions. I got the email Wednesday that my expensive preworkout I ordered from the UK would be delivered Tuesday 10 - 2 p.m and it's now Saturday and my package hasn't even been scanned for days but supposedly it isn't lost! with a 1 star rating on Trust Pilot how can a company like this still see record breaking profits?! It's time for American's and people around the world to stop using them!"
"UPS customer service liars, and dishonest I do not like UPS anymore they say the item will be delivered such time they never come instead, I receive an email saying that it’s delayed also my package has been delayed for two days the third day the package is still not here, even though they say it will be delivered by the end of the day, which is 7 PM I called Customer Service they lie they ass off when you ask where is my package."
Aweful service 2 days in a row package out for delivery signature needed and no delivery... if you aren't able to deliver the product don't state your out for delivery I stayed home for 2 days waiting and nothing. are you going g to pay my wage for fing waiting for you......
"I run a small business, I paid for next day delivery and now I find out maybe the material I ordered will arrive in two days, possibly later. Previously I placed an order that was shipped to an address I haven't been at for over 5 years. When my vendor contacted them to resolve the issue, ups told them ""that's not our problem"" even though the shipping label was changed at a ups distribution center. I'll be making sure all my shipments run through FedEx or not at all."
"The service of this company is I will call it a ripp-off. I have gotten packages with this company several times. Every single time the delivery worker cannot see that you paid the fee.
Once I paid the fee twice to get my package.
Twice they send me nudges which turned out to be incorrect.
Another time - the latest shipment, I paid the fee the day I get my package. 6 weeks later I get another bill! I query and had emails back and forth to sort it out and they could not give me a proper explanation. It was supplements I got, and then the last answer was that they billed me for I quote: ""a veterinary inspection""!!!?!? I was fed up to deal with this circus and paid that bill which was 3 times more expensive then the one I paid originally.
I decided to write this review and say: DO NOT USE UPS. Something is awfully wrong with this company.
I am never ever again going to use UPS -- never!!!"
Got a pair of surf booties and they're perfect. This was the best price I found online and they arrived on my doorstep 2 days after ordering. Very happy!
"Absolutely useless...first I sent parcel from UK to Poland of the value of £200...I paid for delivery £170 ... And today I spent a whole day at home waiting for the parcel to arrive,but they have just sent an update to collect from access point... Does UPS stand for ""useless parcel service""? It perfectly describes the service 👍"
"The delivery delayed for 4days. Liar company. Don’t deal with this company ever. -Montreal, Quebec Canada"
My ups driver passed out from the heat and I hade to give him some water so he could wake up till the ems came
"Every time I am to receive a shipment via United Parcel Service, it never fails, they say they attempted delivery while I am working from home right in front of my front door and windows, which has not to date, been true. They constantly take the packages to delivery locations in the neighborhood without making any attempt to deliver to the original address. It is unacceptable to have to call and attempt to speak to someone other than a Bot to find out why this is acceptable behavior of their drivers and have to spend 15 or more minutes just to get an agent on the line. The package even says it was delivered to a pickup location a day before it was even scheduled for delivery. Then it updated to say it was delivered to my home, while I was on the phone with UPS, which again is untrue which I informed the agent of. If I find that a business uses UPS for delivery service, I will no longer be partaking in that business' services."
"Abysmal - another dishonest claim that I wasn't home to receive delivery when I was here waiting. UPS do this every time year after year.

Update (26 Feb) - Astonishingly UPS now claim I refused the parcel, an out and out lie. This was stated on the tracking information (since deleted) immediately after I posted this review on the 24th. An act of spite maybe? My parcel has still not been delivered nor left at the pick up point. All tracking has grond to a halt and Fernando at UPS has not responded to my email sent yesterday.

Disgraceful"
"The worst system for international packaging, honestly ridiculous!"
"can we add a 0 star feature, UPS would easily qualify as the worst service ever experienced. they deserve to be dissolved as a company, I have never once had a single solitary good or even decent experience with UPS"
Worst company ever. 14 days late with an urgent package. Would probably be quicker walking right round the planet.
"Worst delivery service. The courier didn’t even try to deliver the package to my door. They just left it at the pickup station and I need to go 2km because of the lazy courier that didn’t do their job. I paid for the delivery to my door, what the hell is wrong with your couriers?! Totally do not recommend it to anybody"
"The absolute worst delivery company. Cannot be trusted, I don't understand why companies still use it. Every time they are due to deliver at home (Stockholm, Sweden), the delivery always gets status ""failed, no one was home"" and they say they left a card. I have not once not been home for the delivery, no one comes. Their customer support has a bot that will waste 30 minutes of your time just to tell you to go to the website and disconnect. Terrible experience time and time again."
"I have returned to my country after a period abroad and sent some boxes containing my personal belongings using UPS. No custom fees are due if you send your personal things back home after a period abroad for work (or other reasons). They do not even make it clear, but I have eventually found it out.

Despite having provided UPS with the never ending list of documents to prove I was genuinely moving back to my country (flight tickets, payslip, etc.), as of today, after almost 3 months since I moved back home, UPS keep on sending me invoices and requests of payments for those boxes!!

In the past weeks I have received at least 5 invoices and every time I have to explain the same thing over and over again. Every time UPS confirm I do not have to pay anything, but still, after a few days new invoices keep on coming. Funnily enough, the last one was a payment request for a late payment on an invoice which was never due in the first place. Appalling and frustrating."
"The driver never comes and I always have to pick my packages up from some of their points…
This is the worst delivery company in Germany, they’re even worse than DHL!!
I always panic when someone sends me my stuff with this bad service."
"USE ANOTHER COURIER!!!

Worst experience, customer service need serious training. I lost 2 days pay to wait at home to meet there 'estimated' requirements as I have no other safe place to leave the parcel. the company DO NOT return phone calls.

PATHETIC PROCESS..."
"(P1) Awful service never again. It was quicker to have my five items flown from Italy to Germany, then land in the UK, than it was for a driver to drive 7 miles across the West Midlands. Promise delivery 0830-1030 its now nearly 9pm no sign, no sign of it. No updates, nothing. Trouble is Yoox, I purchased from them from, I will not go back to because of them. I hope Yoox is listening.
(P2) Placed a complaint with my pay source, they in turn placed it with Yoox.Low and behold the parcel arrived today. No updates other than, 'By the end of the day'. Maybe on to something here. Don't pay until you get your goods. Good job we have no lives to live, other than wait around in hope for goods you've paid for. Only 24hrs late. I'm better off than some thanks to stopping the money to the supplier I think."
paid double to have it delivered in 2 days and now it looks like 6 would of been just as fast mailing it.
"Their website said my delivery was due today 8:30-12:00, it’s now 17:30 and no delivery. Called customer services, only way to get through is to select “get a quote” (otherwise not interested in talking to you) and the guy said it’s still in customs and not due today. No compensation, wasted a day off work at home. No apology."
"If there is a choice not to choose any stars i would choose that one! Terrible service! My first time to use UPS. I guess their modus is to put on the status of the package “delivered” even if they did not really deliver it to the recipient. So next time when the recipient has another delivery, she would pay a $6 fee for changing the delivery into “hold the package to the UPS store”thinking that someone took the first package and the recipient has no trust anymore in delivering into her home address but actually that scenario didn't really happen. This business should close due to dishonesty and no integrity! Read the reviews of the majority! You should close your business! Amazon Prime delivery is way much the best!!!"
"I used to think highly of ups - no longer the case. They misled/lied to me multiple times about my package arrival time. I was told the package would arrive by noon, I waited all day for this urgently awaited package. It never arrives. I called 3 times, checked the app, repeatedly they said it was “out for delivery”. Finally, someone on the phone says there was a mistake, a billing label was completed but the oacksge had yet to be picked up. It will definitely be there tomorrow by noon. Next day emails, the app, love people over the phone tell me it is “out for delivery”, be patient, no worries. I wast another day waitingat home. Finally I call again snd am told the package was never loaded in the truck despite all the other inaccurate messages. They say you can pick it up at the local ups facility. I was given instructions to travel to the local main ups facility. I paid a substantial fee to Uber to get me there, but upon arrival I am told the package is not available until the next day! Lied to snd misled AGAIN! I am now out a $65.00 Uber fee. I am told it will be delivered the next day in the morning, it will be a “priority”. It does not arrive!!!!!! I still don’t have my package! Don’t waste your time calling the main ups number, the local staff confided they have “no idea”!where a package really is. Besides you need a black belt in voice mail to get to a real human being on the line. I will use a competitor in the future, never again ups, the company has deteriorated significantly.,,"
"I ordered two books in the USA. Package came thru damaged and empty. Made a complaint thru ups.be. No reaction. I called the customer service. They told to look into complaint. More then two months now. No new delivery, no refund. Shame on you UPS"
"Never ever book any courier with UPS. As they are the worlds most pathetic, rediculous and stupid courier company I have ever seen in my entire life. They just keep your package with them and add warehouse charges for your shipment. Can you believe I had to pay 150usd for the clearence of a consignment worth 200usd. These are so unproffessional so never take their services"
"This just happened as of writing this.
Theres a bit of a freezing rain storm rolling through(nothing severe) Im driving home pull in my driveway and theres a UPS truck outside in front of my house(im expecting a package). Drivers sitting there for awhile then drives off after 5ish minutes. Go out the front door to look for my package and its not there, check tracking says ""Delay due to emergemcy situation or severe weather""
It wasn't delayed because of weather it was delayed cause you guys lose or steal almost every package in the last month I have had multiple packages that were supposed to be 2-Day air turn into 5 day ground when the packages are just larger envelopes. Most of the time when I order if the place has a note section I say don't ship UPS. Honestly horrible I'm pretty sure a pigeon with a 2lb envelope strapped to it could do better.

I gotta say somehow Fedex is somehow better

also i wish i could provide a picture as proof"
"This was the worst experience ever 3 weeks of Hell, neither shiper or receiver knew anything for 5 weeks
Keeped telling me it would be 8 business days then they would close case, reopen case then another 8 business days
No communication what so ever
They only WISH you would Go away!! Way to go UPS 2/22"
"Did not deliever package right, I was asleep, and UPS man did not ring the doorbell, and just left a notice, that is unacceptable, we are never using UPS again."
"I’m good to avoid using UPS like the plague. Every package that’s delivered is smashed, misshapen or torn with half the contents falling out. Also, when I get a number to track package from the store I’ve placed an order from, the tracking isn’t available. All I get is “the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible”. It won’t give me a date till the day of. What kind of package tracking is that? UPS has gone downhill."
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN. I SPENT OVER 2 HOURS ON THE PHONE TRYING TO CHANGE/CONFIRM A DELIVERY. MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE, AFTER MESSAGE, NO SUPERVISORS, COMPLETELY INCOMPENTENT!! IT'S 100% B.S."
These fools are taking their sweet time with my package I don't think they know who they are playing with I WANT MY STUFF UPS!!!!!
"Would not let me talk to a real person. My delivery which was already ready to be shipped was randomly canceled. Website gave me no further information on how to do anything or what happened. Called to pick up and never got more information, if the package was there, or when I could pick it up. One of the worst experiences with customer service ever.

Even after numerous attempts to talk to a representative the bot would just hang up and refuse to connect me."
They don't deliver packages. There customers services are awful
"So I ordered a shoes about a week ago, but like yesterday when I went to see updates about the order it says that my address is fake and tells me to change it but the thing is, I CAN'T CHANGE IT! I don't recommend using this service for your orders, because there are lot better services."
Very poor delivery service. Do business with UPS at your own risk. Absolutely bad for business. Would have rated below 1 star if there was anything like it!
"I have 2 orders scheduled to arrive today, both requiring signatures. They were both scheduled to arrive between 12 and 2. This works because I can take a long lunch and get both packages. This morning they changed one package to arrive between 1:45 and 4:45... So I have to take half a day off to accommodate UPS or pay $7.99 to go to another town to pick it up. WTH? They charge me to do THEIR job!"
Jaime at store #0417 made me realize that there is still good people in the world. She was helpful and knowledgeable in the returning process of my amazon package she rock!!!! Your personality fits the job that you are in with UPS! Thank you Jaime…. DB
"UPS used to stand for something, now it's a poor excuse for a delivery company. To start with, they don't actually deliver but make you fight for getting your packages returned and not destroyed. I had to call every day, twice a day, learn to speak Italian because the UK team wouldn't help me, send various forms and copies of personal documents to five different emails, and eventually beg for my gifts intended for 150 people to be returned to me and not destroyed. If that sounds like your idea of fun, use this company. Otherwise ANY competitor is better."
"Another terrible rate for UPS...
Can't have anyone on the phone to explain me invoice's details, even with 6 transfers at one 1 call. No email address to contact them too, just a pathetic form to fill on their website with a characters limitation...."
"My experience of UPS is very negative, and surprise surprise there are 1000s of other people who WILL NEVER USE UPS again.
UPS late payment fee is a scam, especially when the full payment has been made.
SHAME ON UPS, ....."
"Driving on 77S in the Charlotte into SC area I came upon a UPS truck in the left lanes - NOT supposed to be there - and doing over 70 mph. This was at rush hour on a Monday, those trucks should have GPS monitoring systems. Cab number was 277-545, driver should be fired."
Poor service not satisfied with the service. Take tooo much time in delivery I request to all do not use this courier service I send a courier 8 Feb whiche is not delivered yet
"I was unable to complete payment for a shipment ordered online. I tried the customer service number...No service no help, just an endless loop of getting no help to resolve the problem, pure frustration and a waste of a great deal of my preciosu time."
"my package was delivered a day later than ""estimated delivery date"". according to the ups terms and conditions ups ground is subject to guaranteed delivery date however the store clerk told me that ups only guarantees the delivery date for next day service. when i argued he said that i must prove it (!) does ups even provide any basic training to it's employees? such unprofessionalism is just embarrassment for the company, unless lying to the customers is the official ups policy."
"Ordered metal shelves from eBay. UPS needed 7 days and made 11 stops before a driver dumped the box about 100 yards from my house. I'm 74 years old and made a difficult struggle to get the 60 pound box inside.
Why use UPS? Wait for it..."
"As far as deliveries go, UPS has been 5 stars, just to let you know.
That said I sent messages to both the Plaistow NH as well as Bolton CT, as I had a 3x4' granite slab to send from one to the other. I expected the cost to be out of my league, but wanted a guesstimate. No reply from either.
I'd tried phoning Plaistow. Their ads show smiling faces doing their many UPS office tasks, but it seems they're too tied up with said tasks to answer the phone.
Uship took my info on their site and a carrier sent me a $350 offer -- more that the item was worth, but at least I got an answer forthwith. I'd stick with Uship.
Sorry UPS, I wish I had something better to say. But you aren't worth the trouble outside of deliveries or drop-offs."
"Shocking couriers.

My delivery was for Friday between 10-14.45. At 3pm they changed it to all day 7pm. You cannot get in contact with anyone to leave in a safe place and I had to go out at 5pm to pick my child up. They came at 5.10pm and left a note that no one was around so they would deliver on the next working day which is today. Now the tracking states that it is at sorting office and no delivery date available yet. This is so bad, not only do they change the hours for delivery but they do not attempt to delivery the next day. I cannot keep taking time off to wait for them. Unbelievable!"
"I've been trying to get a hold of my package for 3 weeks now. UPS claims they tried to deliver at my door several times but I received no call. Then I was informed by email the package would be available at a local pick-up point. We went three days in a row, and it was not there. We called the customer service and they ""updated"" the delivery information (they claimed the door number was missing on the package) and that it would arrive shortly. Tracking hasn't been updated for 7 days and it's neither at my home nor the pick up point; just constantly ""in transit"". Called the customer service again and was reassured again it would be right around the corner."
"There is no reality in which the condition of my package is acceptable. It was a $110 textbook, on top of $70 for 2 day shipping. It arrived looking like it sat in a puddle of water for 2 days. If I were the driver, I would rather claim I lost it than deliver it in that condition. There is no work ethic anymore."
UPS always delivers our packages in a timely manner. Our driveway is an icy mess. The driver walked down to my yard to hand me my parcel. We never have issues. Great service. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. We've never had this experience with UPS.
"If your life depends on UPS delivering a package on time or undamaged you're a goner.

What' worse is they don't care!"
"I had ordered some products from Makeup.se with clear instructions about my address, location, pin code and phone number and chose ups for home delivery. But they delivered the packet to a store 4 km away without contacting me. The reason was i wasn't available. How why? I had to take a cab to pick ut up as there was a warning.'if you don't pick it up we will send it back to the shipper.'. It was a prepaid order. I regret choosing ups. Never ever choose Ups. The worst delivery company. ."
UPS delivered someone else’s package to my house. I tried calling to make them aware of the incorrect delivery. The automated phone system would not connect me to an agent nor did it have any options to resolve this. What am I supposed to do? This is the worst automated phone system I’ve ever experienced; hard to believe a company this size has this bad of an experience for incoming calls.
"They tell me they are going to deliver on Friday. I take the day off of work to be sure I am around to sign and take delivery. I wait at my house until 9:00 pm, and no one ever comes. Tracking says it will still arrive. Next day, tracking says they’ll let me know as soon as they know when it will be delivered. Huh. You are supposed to deliver Friday and on Saturday you don’t know when you will deliver. You could give your customers a lot better info and service than you do."
"I was requesting to reschedule my delivery date on 23 ,. They eventually delivered it on today. I have my situation not able to receive it."
"This service returned a package for ""not being picked up"" and charged me (the sender) for the return. The package was not delivered to the address on the package but was delivered 2.5 miles away at a drug store. The driver did not attempt to deliver to the correct address and instead took the package to what they call an ""access point"". The recipient, who gets multiple packages daily, did not immediately recognize a missing package as they have never had a problem with packages being delivered. Customer Service only takes the driver word and no investigation. Poor service and poor customer service."
"UPS shipped me the wrong package it had my name and address but when I opened it is was for a woman 6 states away. I then went into the store to have the packed shipped to the woman whom ordered it and they said they couldn't because the package was opened, then tried to blame ups delivery driver. The thing is the package had my name and address the driver did his job. The store put the wrong product in the box. Went to the post office for a label hopefully the lady gets her package this time."
"Paid an express shipping and received the package in standard shipping time.
Looks like that the reason was that the adress was incomplete.
Never understand why they are picking up packages if the adress is incomplete and why on their tracking app the delay reason is not displayed clearly.
Waste of time and money!"
"Have package delivered supposed but instead received couple of email for reschedule delivery so disappointed with this currier, DO NOT SEND YOUR PACKAGE ON THIS CURRIER."
"Terrible customer service, I even offered to pick up my package and they would let me so I had to wait another 4 days after delivery date to get it"
"It seems to me they must be run by the mafia. Just google UPS Canada class action. These Douche Canoes will lie, cheat, defraud and utterly ignore the rule of law at every turn.
Note for American readers, If you ship UPS into Canada, your customers will utterly hate and despise you. There is no closer equivalent other than raising a middle finger to your Canadian customers than shipping via UPS.

Here's why, they run what is in my opinion a brokerage racket. When you ship via UPS, rather than allowing the customer to use a broker of their choice, which is law under the competition act, they will insist on brokering for the consignee regardless of whether they want to or not. Should the consignee do anything other than accept UPS as the broker, at 4X the competitive going rate (or free in the case of people who can self clear) they will simply mark the package as ""refused by consignee"" even though it was not refused, the consignee simply tried to use a broker other than UPS.

Go google it, there have been multiple court decisions against UPS in Canada for this exact issue, it seems to me they act like the mafia, if you don't accept their brokerage,your shipment may have an unfortunate accident."
"Dear God I wish I'd read all this before I ordered medication online. I paid extra next day service, within 10 minutes I got 2 emails saying my delivery was rescheduled. Next day went from 1 day to 2 to 3, currently looking at as far out as 5 days, if !"
I will never use UPS again!!! No attempt to redeliver my package!!! No customer service! No support to help when your package is not delivered and brought to some random 3rd party location for pickup!!! Just had open heart surgery and cannot pick up my package!!!
"Frankly from what I can see the online reviews this company should not continue to operate. Expected 1 package of ammo from Cabela's. Called they said Wednesday delivery . Called Thursday they said they returned to sender. Now ammo out of stock.. .. absolute horse dung
.... I will never use them..... As a receiver in a warehouse. I can attest to the many wrong delivery by this company... Got to have better reliability and accountability."
I was at a UPS on Warrensville in Ohio and I have witnessed a manager act worse than folks in the streets I had to look to see where I was he was loud rude and I have no clue why he even acted that way in a government public place he need anger management and to be in a factory putting nails in a bucket and not working with actual people he seems violent and may use his power to provoke others then blame them he may need to work at a men shelter with other violent men such as he appears to be I wil never ever visit that location ever again in my life
"their entire system, especially from a customer support standpoint is garbage! Worthless! a huge headache. tried finding out why the return overnight packet that my customer sent her signed legal documents back to us in has for 2 days shown ""on it's way"". called the location she dropped off at 1st.. ""oh we can't track drop offs"". transferred me to corp. after all the prompts get told that I need to go online to file claim. Go online, jump through the hoops to be told ""we can't process your claim right now. try again later"""
"The terrible quality of service received from UPS.
This refers to tracking number XXX and subsequent case #: (most recent first): c-X, c-X and c-X.
Please bear with me while I tell the story first before what I want from this complaint.
On February 2/7/23 and 2/8 UPS notified me that I would receive a package (e-bay order- it matters see after) by 2/7/23 7 PM. The package was not delivered, and UPS did not notify me of it being delayed / not delivered.
On 2/9, I contacted UPS support (chat) and complained that UPS did not notify me, I was not complaining about delay as it was committed 2/9 or 2/10. The agent told me that the package was lost (!) and that I had to contact the sender, something that I can’t do as I am dealing with e-bay not the seller, in order to have it investigated. I stated that it was very cavalier to classify it as lost, and was offered to speak with the local facility to see what happened. A call back was promised but it did not happen.
Therefore I spoke with a supervisor (call back), and we created c-X. Each time, I was promised a call by the facility within an hour. Each time it did not happen. I spoke with a agent (chat) in the late afternoon and the same promise was made, but I asked that this be a call by the manager of the facility. It was committed, and it didn’t happened again!
Each call told me to contact the sender so I opened a request with e-bay and they contacted the seller to contact UPS and of course the seller accused me of being impatient, rightfully not understanding that this was UPS request to contact the seller.
In the evening when complaining about not having been called, again, I was told that the package had been found(!). I complained again that this screw up would not have happened if facility had contacted me… I asked again to be called by the head of the facility and it was committed.
It did not happen so I chatted again on 2/10 in the morning after receiving the package. I asked to be called by the head of the facility. It did not happen. Same in 2/10 afternoon, when after I received a feedback from Richard, a supervisor at UPS call center, the only person who was useful throughout the whole experience. We created c-X, and I was promised that I would be called back.
On 2/13, it did not happen and Richard called me back and created c-X and committed a call back on Monday or Tuesday morning. As you can guess it did not happen. Promises were made again on Tuesday morning, nothing, till I asked for Richard in the afternoon and he himself setup a call at 5 PM with Manuel.
That’s great, as I said Richard was great. And Manuel was great to try to help. But manuel, is a lower level supervisor back from being sick… he did not even know where the request from UPS agents arrive… The call was useless; it was not the head of the facility.
Today, 2/15, I spent hours trying to get a way to contact HQ to raise the complaint. This are the points I want to raise:
• Why wasn’t I properly notified of the delayed package after the notifications that it would arrive? If the notification had been clear, the issues would not have occurred.
• Why was my package lost then not lost? Why did UPS agent say it was lost when it wasn’t? clearly if I had spoken with facility on 2/9 in the morning as planned the issues would have been clarified. How can UPS determine a package is lost like that, unless clearly something happened?
• How can UPS justify that UPS commits to me that I would be called within an hour by the head of facilities and he never, ever call me. It is unacceptable.
• And in fact I see this as a firing offense. I want UPS to discipline and fire the head of the Fremont facilities.
• I want to speak with a HQ executive in charge of customer support to discuss this, bot in terms of what happened and how UPS can guarantee this won’t happen again
• Through e-bay, I paid $12.51, for shipping. UPS do not deserve this fee! Yet I can’t get it other than for UPS as eBay is not at fault, UPS is. Please find a way to compensate me for the poor service, hassle, failures, or just for my time (hours dealing with UPS customer service people) if nothing else; it is worth way more than that.
I am expecting to be contacted by a suitable VP in charge of customer service or operations to explain."
"I was waiting in all day for a parcel only to receive an email from them as they apparently attempted delivery of the parcel at 12.05pm when I was home.
I can onlybassume that the delivery person didn't know how to press a button on a Ring doorbell, because if they did, it would have rang in the home and on my phone. If they knocked, they must have tapped it very softly!
I emailed them back asking why they failed to deliver correctly abd as you can imagine, no response!!
I now have to pick yo tge parcel from Weedon Road to do their job for them!!
Very poor service and I can understand why delivery companies have poor reviews. Shocking service!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
They are lying - UPS said no-one home - while 4 family members were home and could overview the entrance that nobody came - and we have experienced this before - a rotten company - sadly because it used to be the best
"I recently had a terrible experience with UPS. I was expecting an important package and tracked it. When it was supposed to be delivered, I was notified that my package was delayed and wouldn't arrive for another week. I reached out to the customer service department for assistance and the representative was unhelpful and not accommodating at all. I was very disappointed with the customer service and ended up having to wait an extra week for my package."
"Less than one star please

A combination of software bugs, service workers, that can't answer my questions and don't want to help.....at the end I spent 2 hours without receiving my parcel."
We no longer use UPS Stores for delivering our packages. They claim to lose 1 to 2 packages weekly and are not held accountable for them. They have no tracking system in place of when packages leave their building and rely on UPS corporate to take the fall when packages are lost. No accountability means reckless handling of packages. Too much of a risk to take. Will ship FedX from now on.
"UPS skrev ""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery"", men jeg har været hjemme hele dagen, kun for at modtage denne pakke."
"If, as I am, you are an ebay business seller, or a private one, for that matter - you will probably sell an item and then use ebay's paclink service to book a delivery and print a label. I do this with UPS, having chosen to use them for even lower value items because I believed their service was good and reliable. I've changed my mind. The delivery address was the usual ebay generated UPS label - clearly a domestic address, but they sent the buyer an email saying delivered but it wasn't, and worse, the delivery postcode turned out to be AMAZON - a huge warehouse 25 miles from the customer and that postcode was not on the label. Three phone calls later, each promising callbacks that never came. Today a public post on Facebook on UPS's page produced a messenger conversation telling me eventually (thanks Ana) that as the delivery had been arranged by paclink (ebay's system) that I was a 3rd party and unable to complain or initiate any response. They advised me to get ebay to make a claim. Ebay tried to help to be fair, but they provided me with the same link I'd tried. So - the upshot is if you buy postage on ebay, and UPS mess up and deliver it to the wrong address there is nothing you can do at all. The way they dealt with it is very strange - like this....

Thank you again, Paul.

Rest assured that at any stage we wanted you to have a bad experience with our services. From the data accessed, is needed to start an Investigation so, the whereabouts of the parcel sent can be confirmed by our team assigned.

Since the main account holder is PACKLINK (EBAY), we need them to contact us in order to continue to start the progress and process of the Investigation. We are in total disposition to help, however, when you choose another website to use our services the relationship becomes a Third party, but for us to provide accuracy on the details we require the Account holder's intervention. -Ana

So - they give the third party tracking info, but for what point? If as happened to me, it says delivered which initiates the customer saying ""oh no it hasn't"" and then UPS saying - ah, we delivered to the wrong address, how can that not be enough information. By ticking the correct boxes (as in the third party box) the claim gets rejected I have unticked the 3rd party box and the claim is in - but, ebay have asked me to give them 24 hours, then to contact them again. what a faff! If this was a very expensive parcel I'd be panicking by now. Just be aware that UPS are inflexible, very difficult to contact and when you do, pretty unhelpful. Nice people, I'm sure, but they delivered to totally the wrong address - and left me to just take the hit. They even tell you the call is being recorded and ask permission! Permission to not actually do anything?"
Constantly kept updated as to delivery time - personnel friendly and efficient
"Ups is not anymore a company that i would trust form now on for my shipments.
They are fully disorganized, their customer service is unacceptable, and some of the people i talked with are insolent.
Ups does not keep the delivery times and they lie about the shipment's status and delivery.
The can not be characterized as professionals and the are not trusted to work with companies.
the customer service in Greece that i talked is very disappointing and the employees are not professionals.
Also due to the workload, ups gave my shipment to an other company, they didn't inform me about this, and I couldn't truck my order. this means that i lost truck of my order for 3 days with no clue regarding the location of my order.
Maybe you should have a better control regarding the actions of your branch store.
The work load is not the customers problem but the transportation company. If UPS is not capable of managing this amount of work, then thees should not take over all the shipments. or they have to inform the client form the beginning.
UPS customer service lied to me twice about the delivery, just to keep me happy......
An order that was supposed to come in 2 to 4 working days was delayed now i am still waiting and we are already on day 7.
Unfortunately i don't want to cooperate with UPS any more nigher in private level nor at corporate."
"Local ups driver “ Kevin “ out of enid Oklahoma...
This guy is the best!!
A little communication goes a long way towards great customer service.
A simple text message from a driver makes all the difference.
To bad ups as a whole can’t follow his example."
How long does it take to deliver a package? My package has been out for delivery for 2 days and trying to reach customer service is more frustrating than trying to speak with the cable company when trying to disconnect your services.
The worst place to receive packages. No one that works there can offer any correct information in regards to whether packages were received or sent back. I was told they were waiting on a package that had been sent back.Twice in one week. And that one of my packages was there “ until the end of the day”. I went there to pick up the one package that wasn’t shipped back and was told the system didn’t allow them to keep it until the end of the day. The manager was extremely rude. The worst UPS is on 8583 Irvine Center Drive. Horrible experience.
"Absolutely the worst of all delivery services. They never make any deliveries on time, will continuously lie time after time regarding “attempt to make delivery” just because they’re personally falling behind, so they can blame the customer instead. If you choose to do a pickup expect the same thing to happen; not only that but they end up never showing up and keeping the money they charge for a pickup. If you see something being shipped by UPS just expect it to go terribly wrong."
"About 4 months ago, I sent the return of shoes to Canada
Found out about a month later that my parcel was lost - over $200
Filed a claim with UPS
Called to follow up in November- was told that claim was approved
Since then, called twice - in December and January and was told twice wait for check within 10 days
Still waiting"
If I could give it zero stars I would…horrible experience. If you have UPS expect your package…never
"Where is my parcel
It has not been delivered"
"UPS is literal trash.

I don't understand why some drivers can find my house and others either can't or just decide to give my packages to whoever they meet on their route that day.

A package required a signature and it was still delivered to the wrong house and when I called UPS they said ""the package didn't require a signature"" it literally said on their official UPS email ""21 year old must be available to sign for the package"""
Cannot pay import fees at the door. Driver arrives to give me the import fee invoice and has the package in hand but I have to go online and pay and then wait for the driver to reattempt delivery the next day. Drove off with my package. Completely absurd. Never received notice of outstanding import fees prior to initial delivery attempt.
Just don't my order has been delayed every day for a week now saying dw it will come tomorrow so just don't they are crap
"Actually deseves a -0 score but system does not allow less than a 1. What happened to UPS years ago it was a great company not any more. Automated system worthless, When you finally get a live person there from South East Asia and incompetent. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I guess you get what you pay for. I deffinitly will go elsewhere for shipping."
Ordered 2 electrical strips a week ago. Today I received a message of attempted delivery at 10:44am. There was clearly NO attempt made as it was going to my po box which is open until 5. I tried to contact them & no way to reach them by phone. Just a dopey non helpful robot message. This was an Amazin order. Don't know what options are left anymore. UPS Surepost is totally unreliable and dishonest.
"My tracking number for the package, said it will arrive at 7:00 pm . After 7 i waited one more hour and nothing. I woke up the next morning to check if the package was at my door , but nothing. I check the tracking number and it said it was delivered at my door . So i call UPS to let them know, I never got a package at my door . UPS told me the package had no unit number My question was. so where would it be ,If the delivery driver put it at my door with no unit number . Why would a delivery driver even deliver it without a unit number. Now I have to wait 10 to 15 business days for investigation."
"My niece and I moved , she couldnt talk to anyone when calling customer service phone number, so I tried, got nowhere so she talked to local ups store, that wasnt any help, they ended up delivering her package to our old address where we moved from."
"Ups does not keep its promises,I complain about the Brokage fees which is usually too much and I was told that is going to be waved, which was indeed waved but then the punishment is that they didn't deliver after the complain reasons I don't know why, when I called them the tell me that they are sorry but one is not sorry and keep on doing the same thing!!!! again and again."
"THE WORST DELIVERY COMPANY !!! SCAMMERS
The worst delivery company ever with useless customer service!!!
I made a Gift for my sister wedding an expensive AIR FRIER. The wedding was in Portugal. Unfortunately she already bought the same so we have to send it back in UK for refund.
And this is where my ""GREAT"" experience with the WORST DELIVER COMPANY begun.
I have ordered postage label with collection from Portugal and deliver to UK. In the postage label I have add value of the item and extra insurance.
The UPS collected the item from Portugal and they lost the package somewhere. I have contacted them and they told me ""the parcel has been lost"". I said ok, it can happened and my nightmare with UPS ''GREAT"" customer service begun.
I have ordered the label as guest from them website but you are unable to make a claim if you don't have account. I made the claim from my UK account with explaining everything but I was't able to add Portugal address for the collection as a started point because every time I got the message from UPS ""GREAT"" website ""YOU HAVE TO ADD VALID UK ADDRESS"".
This doesn't make any cense but this was the only way to continue.
I have contacted them many times Customer Service and they were very unprofessional.
At end I paid UPS 34£ service for delivery and the lost item for 240£ . TOTALY LOST 274£.
You can use UPS but it will cost you and they will lost your parcel and not take responsibilities because are SCAM COMPANY !!!"
"SurePost is a failure. Since SurePost began it is a toss-up as to whether I will ever see my packages. I did find one. It was at the Post Office and it was clear it would have sat there forever if I had not gone looking for it. ""Oh, is this it?"". Amazon and UPS will pay the price as many will stop using them because they use SurePost."
It is absolutely ridiculous trying to get a person on the phone. A Message said issue with delivery address and they come to this location 10 plus times a week. Calling them actually makes my blood pressure go up
Needed to sort my accounts and to get invoices for the card charges. No one helped me. Not even understood what Im asking. I have been transfered through 10 people and had to explain over and over. I also tried to upgrade from having just UPS Id to an actual account - to gain access to billing centre. Again. Zero knowledge of what im asking. No help. Wasted hours of my time of what should be basic. Still not resolved.
"The person that shipped the package with UPS was told that UPS delivers at home and gave them my phone number, so that I can receive my delivery. After one day delay because apparently they did not know that I wanted the package delivered to my home, when I had already said so twice, I talked with two different people on the service (two because of the inexplicable delays), explicitly telling them to deliver it at my place and that the driver has to call me, because it is not easy to find my door. These two people said ok, we will make sure they call you. Today they say that the driver came and did not find me. I call them and I said that the driver is lying because no one called me. They told me that their drivers don't have company phones. Go figure! We paid for a service that four people told us it could be provided. Apparently it cannot. Don't use this service if you want anything delivered to your home."
"I had to call them to try to redirect my parcel. They were not able to do it, so I drove 400 miles to go to my former address and receive the parcel. In the meantime, somebody at UPS did return the parcel to the sender without my consent. I wasted 400 miles of gaz and 6 hours + 3 hours by phone. Worst customer experience."
"My package which I paid extra in delivery to get a fast, has not arrived yet even though it has been in transit since Thursday evening and now it's Monday late afternoon and it is not arriving today either. I'll thoose GLS in the future they are way cheaper and they deliver whit in the time frame that they write. This company is not what it was years ago

It takes 2 days from Spain 2000-3000 km but now after it arrived in Denmark you can't deliver still not here after 4 days in transit and there's only roughly 100 - 150 km 👎"
"I don't even need to explain, everybody has experienced it too, awful delivery service, and any company using them will he awful also!"
"No help from customer support, spent 20 pounds on talking to the automated customer support, did not help my package is still stuck in a warehouse. When I finally talked to a customer service rep I told them to cancel the shipment and send the package back to the sender, the automated customer support robot still says it is on its way to the reciever."
Worst communication and delivery process ever I’m so frustrated with ups they know what they are doing at all I can’t even believe they are still In bussines being the baby boomers back I was told my order was ready for pickup today and it’s not even there that’s half of the story
Extremely polite delivery person who delivered my parcels with care and on time. All my parcels have arrived in pristine condition. I would trust them with even the most fragile items.
"why there is no phone call from the driver to announce the parcel is next to your door? My parcel was sent back because I wasn't at home at that moment, no notification at all about precise timing. Other companies have this service."
I had ordered something and the last tracking that I looked at said the package was in a city 45 minutes away. That was back on the 10th of february. It is now the 13th and there is no updated information. This is the second time this has happened with ups.
UPS damaged my item and never took ownership for the damage. They repackaged my item in a box 5 times to big without any packing materials and later denied my claim saying I packed it wrong. Customer Service vert rude and never return a call after saying they would look into it. I'm out a $ 800 ham radio over the company negligents. I will use FedEx for all my shipping from now on.
They don’t pay their employees their last check. You ask your supervisor about it and you get lied to. They lie on your hiring paperwork. They treat you horrible as an employee and don’t get hurt on the job they will fire you to try not having to pay workman’s comp. Worse experience ever
They give you a time window to be at the beck and call and then they don't show up! Even the USPS is better than these guys!
"The incompetent driver turned around in my driveway and left.. could not deliver package because they couldn't find my house.. there is a sign with my address at the end of my driveway and numbers on my house.. literally every time UPS is bringing me a package there is some bullsit hassle.. I don't understand how they are even still in business.. fu
k ups"
Had a delivery scheduled for Friday 2/10/23. After waiting several hours after the delivery was supposed to arrive I called ups and they informed me that my package will be delivered before the end of the day. Her exact words were (I promise your package will arrive today. 24 hours later and still no package. Called 2 more times today and I can personally guarantee that they have no idea of what they are doing. Even though tracking says that it's at a warehouse location I'm being informed that it may be lost.
"If I could give it a no-star, I'd do it but because there is no option, sadly I have to pick 1 star.
UPS really needs to make it possible for customers to be able to pick up their package the same day if they are not willing to re-deliver. Customers expediting their packages just to have to pick it up the next business day- what if it's saturday?? That package won't be delivered to a ups site til Monday and that's hella inconvenient. Ridiculous.

If I could pick it up the same day of the initial delivery date, I wouldn't even care to write this review but this has happened waaaaay too many times.

UPS come up with a better system."
I ordered a package the other day that I needed in a very timely manner and they only use UPS and of course it was supposed to be delivered today in the last second UPS changed the delivery day for 4 days later. So now the company that I ordered from has lost a customer because they're so unreliable.(on top of it the tracking says that my package is 15 minutes from my house)
"DO NOT USE UPS. THE delivery driver never attempted to make the delivery all 3 days. Then ups said that you couldn't just come pick up the package that since it was a required to sign on delivery that it had to be delivered. It was supposed to be a A.M. 2nd day delivery and 4 days later waiting from 9 am to 9 pm everyday and seeing the delivery was attempted all three days. It's a waste of your money. The track your package is not updated but once every 24 hours. I haven't recieved any emails to notify me of anything. For now on just use FedEx or the USPS, BECAUSE UPS DOESN'T DO THEIR JOB."
"I ordered iphone 14 for a valentine gift since 1-30-2023
no deliver yet I filed a at ups.com ,in 24hrs investigation closed but we need more details contact us. I tried calling but refused to have live person come on , but allow 15 days to investigate the package. package was last scanned California. someone help explain... i thought investigation was closed? i thought ups agent was available now investigation continue 15 days? i provided receipt and details ."
"2 of my 3 packages delivered . Called the UPS and on hold for hours and when did speak to someone they said I could pick up at local store gave me number to call back day of pick up . Called day of pick up for ups to tell me the store where my package is - is closed for day and I’ll have to wait till Monday !
My package was ordered Sunday - went a completely different route ended up in Texas as a lost package - so my event for Saturday we are missing half of the items. All ups could tell me sorry ! After I called Thurs / fri and sat and spoke to 4 different people and supervisors that told me different statements each time !completely unprofessional and no help"
"When I deal with UPS compared to FedEx and USPS, everything becomes complicated, convoluted, and difficult. And nothing gets accomplished or is delivered in the most difficult time-consuming manner possible. I do everything possible to avoid getting stuck with UPS as a delivery service. I absolutely dread using UPS."
"I reviewed the tracking number got notification package was delivered at 10 am the front door. Great just as expected. Problem was package was not delivered at all.

Having to wait 3 days in sc because they don't open until Tuesday's. In NY where the package was sent opened investigation at both ends. SC told my niece the day she called she saw it moved but couldn't tell anything else. 14 days later great news package shows back up where it was shipped from. It has a sticker stating recipient moved. Which is a complete lie and then I was told I would have to PAY again to send out the package they lost told me it was delivered and then sent it back. What kind of ridiculous service is that. Pay twice and for their screw up that is absurd and stealing from the consumer. It's not like UPS is tiny poor company. Review your policies and thank you for stealing from me."
"UPS IS THE MOST INSENSITIVE COMPANY EVER! THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE LIARS, WITH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAD A PACKAGE TO BE DELIVERED FOR MY WEDDING & THE PACKAGE WAS NEVER OUT FOR DELIVERY AND EVERY TIME AND DAY THAT I CALLED FOR ETA THEY WERE SO QUICK TO TELL ME THAT THEIR DRIVER MADE DELIVERY ATTEMPTS WHEN THAT NEVER HAPPENED. THE WEDDING IS TODAY ON SATURDAY AND HERE I AM FOLLOWING UP WITH THEM AGAIN TO HEAR MORE LIES. #NEVERAGAIN #UPSNEEDTOGOOUTOFBUSINESS"
"So pissed off at UPS

I recently ordered something I need for work - and I purposefully chose for it to NOT REQUIRE A SIGNATURE

They came yesterday and left a note on the door and did not deliver my package, the note said they required a signature (what??) ... So I signed and dated the note they left as it instructed so they could deliver it the next day WITHOUT needing me there to sign. THEY CAME THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT A SECOND NOTE SAYING IT REQUIRES A SIGNATURE IN PERSON. (this time the box they checked said ""adult signature"") WELL I WAS AN ADULT WHEN I MADE MY ORDER AND SAID I DIDNT WANT A SIGNATURE REQUIRED, AND PAID MY MONEY FOR IT, AND I WAS AN ADULT WHEN I SIGNED THE NOTE UPS LEFT ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT, BUT I GUESS UPS JUST MAKES AND BREAKS THEIR OWN RULES AS THEY GO AND CONSIDER MY PURCHASE AS THEIR PROPERTY TO DO WITH AS THEY SEE FIT. ^%@#$^%#!@

I tried logging into their website using my previously created profile, but I forgot my password, and when I tried to reset my password it says there's an error, so I can't have it held at a location either.

I WORK ALL THE TIME AND I LIVE ALONE AND MY PLANS AND SCHEDULE REVOLVED AROUND THIS BEING DELIVERED AS I ORDERED WITH NO SIGNATURE AND ON THE DATE THEY PROVIDED. MAJOR INCONVENIENCE. TWO THUMBS DOWN. SORRY - SOME OF US DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF SITTING AROUND FOR AN 8 HOUR WINDOW WAITING FOR UPS TO DO THEIR JOB.

Garbage."
So the last time I used ups it was scrap show with a package arriving two weeks later. I tried fed ex. They were no better. Went back to ups this week. Scheduled a pick up for Monday. It never happened Wednesday I called they said they would have someone call me back they never did. They showed up while I was out to pickup the package. I had to walk it in finally on Thursday with the promise it would arrive Friday since i paid for overnight delivery. Now they are saying they don’t know when it will be delivered. Do better. But I won’t be around to find out if you do because you have lost this small business.
"Friday afternoon delivery was “NO ONE HOME” …which is a lie.
I have video to prove that no UPS truck ever arrived.
I called in to have the local dispatcher call me – of course that doesn’t happen.

Shame on you - your UPS drivers!
Of course, no one is accountable at UPS.
Right?"
Very nice fast service and cheaper than price in DHl......
"the time window is too big. We will deliver from 9-16. It is said on time, but on the day of delivery, the driver calls when he is almost at the house (5 minutes before). Why can't you warn at least 1-2 hours in advance?"
"UPS is a joke in Romania. Couriers don't have phone numbers, they call you 10 minutes before they arrive at your home and expect you to not go to work and wait for them. Shipping estimates are also unreliable. One of the worst shipping experiences in Romania, they are only taking advantage of their global reputation."
"UPS in Viera, FL
Kat was the best! Fumbling myself, I was unable to pull up the correct return code on my phone. (I had inadvertently reordered the product) In a matter of seconds she created the return and called up the codes that were needed for the items. She did not belittle me in so doing. She was serious but friendly, efficient but engaged in a short conversation and made the whole experience a pleasant one."
Literally just the absolute worst experience. You get shuffled through this automated phone system that doesn't get you anywhere you need to be and then tells you to look on the website and hangs up...
7th feb Ups collected from home in uk to deliver to Hawaii - quoted delivery 9th once we paid it became 10th then 13th but we won’t be at the hotel - on a tour of islands - made loads of expensive calls only to eventually be told can’t change the delivery address and although they have tracking number they don’t actually know where it is at this moment very unhelpful in caring staff never use this excuse for a delivery service!!!!!
"It took UPS 2 weeks to eventually deliver my item. For the last 3 days of the 2 weeks my very expensive Monitor was marked as ""Out for Delivery"" but was not delivered. Each time it was undelivered UPS informed me it'd be delivered the next day. They did this again at 9pm on the last of the 3 days it was still undelivered. I then checked my doorway, no delivery, so I went to bed. At 2.30am UPS emailed me to say my item had been delivered at 9.36pm. The Package quite obviously contained FRAGILE items as there were huge pictures of the Monitor on the 40x20x20 Box. The Box had a 9"" impact area to the top left corner. I now have to return it via UPS and then reorder via Amazon with Amazon delivering it, not UPS. You have more chance getting to talk to BigFoot than you do a Human at UPS. I will never knowingly use UPS ever again."
"I've left 1 negative review in my life and here it is. We paid for overnight shipping for an important package. My wife and I both were home the entire day - no delivery. The following day I'm working from home and have to go to an appointment late afternoon, which then the attempt was made. We try to change the preferences to eliminate the need for a signature, but you have to sign up to do it. While attempting to sign up it says the email is already in use. Entered forgot username to try logging in, but the email to fix it never comes despite trying again and again - garbage software. The day after that, I'm home with my dog who barks at everything. We have no background noise on waiting for the package. At some point I notice a slip on the door where the driver must've been a ninja to not alert my dog literally lying next to the door. I call customer service who puts in an alert to return. The local UPS manager calls me with a sassy tone to say, ""obviously if you had a note, the driver came."" Cool, Patty. Thanks for putting on me when UPS took extra money to have it delivered 2 days earlier and your driver didn't knock. Terrible."
"I get some very expensive medicine sent to me every three months from a major pharmaceutical company. It can be life threatening if I don't take it every day. On January 16th, 2023, my medicine was delivered but not in an acceptable manner. My driveway is about 300 feet long, was plowed at the time of delivery and was accessible to my home. For some reason, the UPS delivery agent decided not to bring it up to my house and placed it in my trash can down by the road. He/she marked it as having been delivered. When I went down my drive the next day to put out my garbage, I saw the package in my trash can. If I would have put my garage in the can, my meds would have been lost. This sort of delivery is inexcusable and the delivery agent needs to be held accountable. I have since asked the pharmaceutical company to require that the UPS agent get a signature from me when a package is delivered. Because I found the package, no damaged was done. And, I'm not asking for anything in return expect that future deliveries by made properly. I called UPS three weeks ago and left a complaint and was told that a supervisor would call me to discuss the situation. Nobody has called! Very poor service!"
"Lisa Higgins at ups in cumberland maryland is a rude, hateful ignorant feminist who clearly gets a false sense of security being in her position. It's clear by the numerous Google reviews by name say the exact same thing. I feel so sorry for the men who have to listen to this creature everyday. Never hire someone like this for customer service. Maybe you should have consequences given all the reviews about this person or just keep losing customers to protect the female hire so you don't get sued"
good and consistent company
"Completely useless. Stay far, far, far away from using their ""service""."
"I have been waiting for my parcel for over 2 weeks and it is supposed to be at the UPS depot in Meyrin, CH. Severe Weather delay is used as an excuse. (The sun is shining in CH). The online phone robotic answered system is absolutely useless. I can confirm after having called at least four times."
"There is always a problem. They tell you a delivery date, you stay in homeoffice explicitly for that, you wait the whole day, and then only around 8 pm you receive status update that for some reason the package will not be delivered. In the status update it does not tell you when the new delivery is scheduled for, you have to wait other days at home, cause they keep moving the date (especially if its an expensive item you dont want it to be left outside). Once I ordered a bike, ups left the bike outside the door with broken and opened packade, did not even bother to ring the bell so I could take the package. Bike with value of 2000 CHF stood outside for hours in an opened package. Absolutely not happy with their service. The complaint system or customer service system is also not working and complicated. When you talk to someone they cant tell you where your delayed package is because “its not updated in their system”."
UPS is the absolute worst. My delivery date has changed 4 times. It's ridiculous. I can see once even twice. Things happen I get that. I refuse to use them ever. I get discouraged when I see an item I ordered is coming UPS. Cause it never comes when they say. And forget about getting a hold of anyone that can help much less even cares. As much as their drivers make you'd think they'd figure this out. All business should stop using them because it makes them look bad.
"I consistently receive friendly, helpful service from Paul, the store manager at store 6378 in Silver Spring, MD. I rely on this UPS location, happily paying more to avoid long lines and sullen service at USPS. Besides mailing packages for me, I've had items printed since I no longer own a printer. In the future, I may need a mail box that is not at my residence. Paul and this UPS will be my go-to!"
My whole package was stolen valued at $845 allegedly... I don't ever want to use ups again and I filed a police report... I'm going to use it for a class action lawsuit against ups
"Since Brexit this totally incompetent, not fit for purpose ""courier"" company routinely ""lose"" all of the attached paperwork making it impossible to get through Customs. They then routinely tell lies about the cause of the issue while offering no solutions to the problems caused by their blunders in the first place! With returns, rather than do something of use like contacting either the vendor or the sender to replace the customs invoices they have lost, they just scan the item every day in seemingly some sort of belief that the missing paperwork will magically appear ! When I received the parcel it was so badly damaged from being under the "" care "" of UPS that I actually had to replace the box before attempting to send it back! I can evidence all of what I said above. UPS are an absolute disgrace and need to be held to account by their regulatory body as soon as possible"
"I ordered a MacBook (so something a “little” more expensive) that’s why I paid an extra fee for security AND the delivery guy had to hand me the package directly. Two times I stayed at home the whole day just to receive an Email saying no one was home. Are you kidding me? I’m sorry but you have to ring the f doorbell! Happened tow times. As I said I even paid an extra fee
Never again"
Didn't deliver on day which was nominated. Didn't communicate about the delay.
"Expecting a perishable shipment. Got notification it arrived. Looked for proof of delivery as we did not receive it. It says delivered to ""inside delivery"". No such thing. Clicked on proof of delivery. Says ""ID verified"" but no name. Useless. Called UPS. Automated service would not allow me to talk to a live person. Just said go fill out a claim online and hung up on me. Awful. >$300 perishable item."
"Paid over 20$ for delivery and the package requires a signature. I used to be able to show up at the shipping facility and pick up after work if I couldn’t take the day off and sit and wait all day, but now they require another payment of 8$ to NOT deliver it and have it sit at the facility. I already paid once. Just asking for it to be held, not delivered to a locker, just held at the UPS facility. This isn’t difficult.
Instead their driver is going to make three u successful trips to my home. That’s on them since I’ve now called 6 times to try to work out a reasonable solution and treated like crap and given no help at all."
"Good old UPS! Still useless! Doesn't change. After many previous problems, e.g. parcels delivered to the wrong address, broken promises to retrieve parcels and redeliver them, claims that they tried to deliver and I wasn't at home when I was etc., today they said they would deliver a package to me between 8.30 a.m. and 12.15 p.m. and at 5.20 p.m. it is still with them and not even out for delivery. When you track a parcel they have four stages ""Label created"", ""On the way"", ""Out for delivery"" and ""Delivery"". My package, which should have been here 5 hours ago is still at the ""Label created"" stage and it's impossible to find out when it will be delivered."
"The UPS on Bijou St. in Colorado Springs is wonderful! The driver, Mike, is careful with packages and is very courteous. The employees, such as R.J., always go out of their way to be sure the customer is taken care of. Thank you to all of you!"
"It was so fast in delivery from Amazon USA to Sri Lanka.
Custom clearance just took one day only.
Super fast delivery.
It was always faster than other couriers from Amazon."
By far the worst delivery company. I always have issues receiving my packages (many of those have been just stolen) And I'm pretty sure I'm note the only one. NEVER use UPS
"their website is not working. my package has delays and i dont even know why.
the reset password function in their website is not working. and when i am trying to create a new account with a different email so i can somehow see the updates on my delayed package, they require a communication via telephone to give me access to UPS my choice. what the actual F? are we in 2023 or 2000? who the F is using a telephone call to resolve issues anymore? especially if the phone number is in the US and i am in europe!!!

Fix your Fing app and then fix your Fing services as well."
"Worst customer service ever! Supposedly they were going to help me locate a lost package. Since they were going to “investigate” the whereabouts of said package, I could not yet post a claim.

However, during the whole investigation they did not resolve anything. When I finally told them to not bother anymore, I could not post a claim anymore because apparently you can only post claims within 2 months after the package was sent. This company is a total scam! Stay way from them."
"Delayed delivery with no refund for 2nd Day Shipping. Apparently no weekend shipping for 2nd Day as well, and they don't give refunds for delays. The customer service reps will juggle you from one to the other with BS, making excuses or ignoring your concerns completely. Don't bother."
"Recently, a UPS sorting facility opened literally 2 minutes by car from my
house, at 2650 Lakepointe Pkwy .
At first I was elated, because they have customer hours and I would be able
to pick up my packages.
I was told that is no longer an option and I can have them delivered to the
UPS Store a day after scheduled delivery. That is not acceptable. Then I
found out that I can pick them up if I pay $8 through the 800 number. I
have done that, but it's a bit of a gouge.
Today, I lost another day of productivity to UPS. The item arrived on the
morning of February 4th. Being a Saturday, I knew the facility would not be
open to the public until my scheduled delivery date of 2/6.
I subsequently received 3 notices via text that my package would be
delivered BEFORE NOON, so I did not call to pay the charge. It is now 6pm,
while MyChoice is still telling me that it will be delivered before noon!
Had I known, I would have paid the $8.
Therefore, I will use 2650 Lakepointe, Odessa as my shipping address
moving forward. It is beyond frustrating waiting and waiting. FEDEX is
ALWAYS here before their estimates! I rejoice when someone ships Fedex
these days.
Eliminating the ""hold at facility"" option when the facility is a mile from
your house has wasted countless hours of my time.
I suggest that you revert to the former policy.

Sincerely,
John P Zias"
This company should get huge law suits against them. If a lawyer just made a group claim against them maybe they would change their customer service because its by far the worst in the world. 2 months my package is lost and you speak to customer service and they can't speak english in the United States of America. They should be dealt with my a ombudsman who should fine them $millions to teach them a lesson. The CEO Carol B. Tomé should be fired from a canon she is the most incompetent CEO on the planet.
"Terrible service in the last 2 times.
Online system - not up to date with status and no email being sent with status in spite of being set up
Workers- everyone says a different status and next steps, incompetency and lack of service & accountability
Overall lack of coordination and customer service…too many follow ups by phone for nothing. Wetsuit Outlet should change provider!"
"Wish I didn't have to give them even one star. I ordered a Superbowl jacket and T-shirt with 2 day shipping last week. It was in UPS' possession on Friday, Feb 3. I also separately ordered 2 Superbowl hats. UPS told me both items were on their local delivery truck. There was clear tracking available for both. On Friday, only the hats were delivered. The other box remained on the local delivery truck and was taken a little more than one mile from my home for the weekend. I believe it likely stayed on the truck until late Sat or early Sunday. The box was ""relabled"" and the previous shipping history was wiped out. It now appears to be orginating in Mesa, about one mile from my home. UPS suggests that it might be delivered on Monday, today, but it is not on a local delivery truck. Usually, when they do this, it does not show up. My 2 day delivery is now in its 5th day and probably going longer. UPS is likely claiming bad weather, but it has been in Arizona since Thursday night and we have been in the sixties with no precipitation. UPS explained to me a few years ago that 2 day delivery for them is not a commitment of any kind. The package gets there when they decide. My question....will it ever get here? I can't access it one mile away which is even more frustrating."
"I have been waiting for 2 months a parcel and they just don’t tell me where it is and when they are going to deliver it. Costumer service is all broken, I think I have already called like 10 times and no one has ever solved anything. Super bad experience! Never again."
worst mail service ever . never deliver the parcel in tym ….
"Been trying to receive a package for a week now. It requires a signature. The first time UPS tried to leave, no one was home. They left a slip to sign so it could be left at their next delivery attempt. I signed, and they still did not leave the package at the second attempt. After the first failed delivery, I had also went onto My Choice and said to deliver with a neighbor across the street (this option was offered on their website). At the second delivery attempt, not only did they not leave my package, but they didn't attempt to deliver to the neighbor either."
"The day my package was supposed to be delivered, they left a neighbors package on my steps and due to it being a huge heavy box I didn't move it, not even 10 mins later the driver pulls back in and gets the box and before I could get to the door to see about my package he was already gone. I watched them from out my window driving up and down my road.. the driver clearly was lost and had no clue who lived where. I received an email saying my package was left at garage.. I have no garage! Customer service is no help!! At 10 pm that night my neighbor contacts me saying the ups man left my package with them in hopes they would get it to me.. REALLY?? He literally asked my neighbor if they would see me and if they could get it to me!!! My neighbor even told him which house I lived at and that's when he asked them if they could just get it to me!!! I paid for said package and why on earth he thought it didn't deserve to be left at my address is beyond me!! UPS get it together!! I did not chose UPS to deliver as I ordered off Amazon and that's who the seller chose but next time I will ask seller before hand and simply not purchase anything if UPS will be the carrier!! I never have problems out of fed ex and they go above and beyond when leaving packages.. honk the horn when arriving, knock on the door, wrap my package in plastic if it's raining, and have never left my package at the wrong address!! UPS THIS WAS SIMPLY CARELESS AND LAZINESS!! They do not care about packages!!!!"
"I read e-mail my package left at porch. No package! Started to make claim what a hassle they do not want you to make a claim.
After at least an hour did get a claim in.
A day and a half later I see a person pushing a hand truck with a large box on it.
Ding ding could that be my package?
Yes a neighbor from two plus blocks away comes up to me, ""GOT YOUR PACKAGE"".
This the second time. Plus a shipping mess outgoing.
A TOTAL LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, NOT WORTH A HOOT"
UPS lost my package I ordered from a merchant I filed a claim with UPS and they issued the claim check to the merchant. My merchandise remains lost the merchant will not respond to my numerous requests to replace the merchandise UPS said there is nothing else they can do. Customer support and claims department are outsourced you cannot speak to anyone in America never no matter how you try Americans are not available never. Do Not Use this Business they have really bad business practices
"UNRELIABLE POSTAL SERVICE
Had two packages in route before Severe weather end of January. Packages were mailed on same day. Package one was sent next day Air. Package two was sent 2 day air. Package 1 was processed at Fort Worth center @1300 E. Then next day package 2 was processed @ Fort Worth center @ 1300 E. Place on truck and delivered....what happen to package 1??? Package 1 was listed on tracking status as delayed for severe weather. WHAT???? But package 2 was delivered from same center and presumably by the same truck that could have delivered package 1"
"Delivery delayed for a week because of weather. However, USPS has delivered to our house everyday….."
"Order a motorcycle part. That had a 3 week order date. Package was received at UPS and arrive at the Savannah GA location. It was scan with no delivery date. 3 days later, I received a email delivery bye 4pm. Order never arrive, the scan on ups site reflects out for delivery. Contacted customer service and they had no idea where my package location. Guess Ups worker needed this part, box sitting in warehouse, sitting on truck and driver wanted his Friday to start early. Sad, that they have no idea what happened to my package. Had to file a lost item form for investigation. Last time using UPS."
"I booked a UPS collection and delivery of a very important package to be shipped to Spain. The package contained a special wheelchair for my profoundly disabled son. I completed all the relevant paperwork before the package was collected, specifying that the package contained a wheelchair. I also rang UPS customs support to check how to complete the customs declaration for the wheelchair. At no point was I advised that I could not send a wheelchair to Spain.
However, once the package reached Spanish customs it was stopped and prevented from being transported onwards to its destination - the reason being that wheelchairs are restricted items - classed as medical equipment, and cannot be shipped into the country by an individual.

If that wasn't bad enough, the package remained at customs for another 4 weeks, during which time I emailed UPS on an almost daily basis and phoned them sometimes, quite literally, in tears, desperately seeking their help in getting my package back. I felt totally alone and unsupported. At no point had UPS told me that I couldn't send a wheelchair to Spain, and surely they must (or should) have been aware of this. I spent a considerable amount of money shipping such a large and heavy package but when I eventually got the wheelchair back to the UK and asked UPS for a refund, they did not want to know. The moral of this is, DO NOT trust UPS to deliver anything of importance overseas - they do not know the rules and will not support you if things go wrong!
Tracking number: 1Z85T040D999062834"
"They are unethical and unhelpful. Senders pay top dollar fot faster delivery to the recipient and they still extort a disbursement and brokerage admin charge that is more than double the fee for govt vat. They don't know size or weight of item and the telephone wait times are over an hr with no answer.

I would not use their service and il tell everyone else not to either.one of worst businesses in RSA. I eoukd give them no stars if I could as this matter needs legal address as wehave no idea about their additional costs. They charge us twice or more to deliver same package and from negative hear we still don't get it tineously."
"I payed for overnight shipping, and i still have yet to recieve my package. It was supposed to arrive tonight but for some ridiculous reason the delivery time was extended. Multiple times has this happened and i have not recieved any information as to why they do this but i will not be using ups again, most unreliablr service ive ever seen."
Package was not delivered in suggested time frame and was not notified about being late
Had my delivery set for today then last minute changed it all the way till Monday when I paid express and everything . Very unreliable. NEVER using again
"Again, UPS? Seriously? What emergency could possibly make it so you couldn't deliver to our house today? Literally says Emegency issue. Lol, this place had really gotten bad. Amazon 2 day delivery takes a week amd also recently they've gotten into the habit of delivering our packages to a car dealership in our small town and asking them to let us know it's there.....lazy or WTH???"
"My normal service from UPS is usually pretty APPALLING and they are one of the BACKWARD companies that will not let you send them a photo of the property to ensure safe delivery!!
But today TERRY from NEWHAVEN Depot went totally above and beyond and made a delivery to me after he had finished his probably long and overloaded shift for not much reward as my original delivery had been fouled up by someone else. Despite the usual simpering hand wringing useless promises by customer services on the phone.
So 11/10 to TERRY from NEWHAVEN and 10/10 to Jacquelin from NEWHAVEN for assisting him"
In my part of Canada this company is in utter chaos! Unbelievably bad service. Unusable technology. If you want your package to arrive don’t use UPS!
Unable to sign for parcel before arrival despite creating online UPS account. Option to leave with neighbour disappeared one day before was out for delivery. Didn't even try to deliver up stairs in flat building as note left at bottom of shared hallway.
"I wouldn’t even give them a one star. One of the worst courier companies. Staff have no motivation to clear shipments. It takes 1 week to deliver, if they deliver after it has reached the destination. Would never ever use them again"
"Peligro!!!! Es una estafa de empresa, no trabajen con ellos. Perderás de alguna manera u otra. Desde el servicio de aduana hasta la entrega del paquete son unos estafadores y mentirosos.
Danger!!!! It's a scam, don't work with them. You will lose one way or another. From the customs service to the delivery of the package they are scammers and liars."
"UPS has kept my package for several days at each stop along its journey. And the tracking makes no sense at all. They finally gave me an estimated delivery date on the 5th day of this journey. On that day it was still hundreds of miles away, but being supposedly delivered in a few hours. Today it still says the same ETA even though that time has past and package is still hundreds of miles away. I know there are weather delays etc, however, FedEx and USPS still manage to inform customers of the delays. All I get is conflicting and antiquated info when I enter the tracking number. This is day 8 and still no package…..waiting."
"I purchase a car part from us and the shop is located in Las Vegas, the shop uses UPS the biggest freight company in the world and wurst company that are not service minded at all by hiding their support with a self service tape recorded support that can't understand the language in this case Swedish, if I call support it means that i need a person to talk to not a recorded voice, they failed to notice the transit exactly when the package was in transit over in US and from Thursday morning by 2.52 am and 12 hours after there was no notification until the driver couldn't deliver it at my door, are not the first choice to deliver to their check points priority number one, I have read on Google that UPS not do home delivery at the area where i am living due to its not a safe place for the drivers, i have deleted the ups app and don't wish to purchase anything from a shop from us that has ups as a transportation company best regards Mr Lars-Anders Malmberg"
"Should not even be a 1 star review. They are beyond horrible. They lost my package of $254. Then connecting with them was a hassle.Would go through chat, then they would say to write review but wasn't allowed. Then would email me and they would redirect me to call them and was never allowed to be transferred to agent. After so much push ""supposedly"" had claim open after speaking to agent through phone but then they closed my claim without giving me a refund or sending a new order. In addition, they would be ignorant every time I contacted them and has been occurring for about 2 weeks."
"Why UPS drive didn't knock or ring? I was at home and just saw how he was tucking UPS notice to collect from the access point. Why I have received an email from you that the Delivery is scheduled on Thursday 02/02/2023 from 10:15 - 14:15, but the driver appeared only at 16:00? Absolutely disgraceful service. I assume that it is easier for the driver to drive along the route, give a paper notice to everyone, and drop all the parcels at the Access Point?"
"Added Feb 5, 2023:
Western Digital/SanDisk has agreed to send a replacement product (instead of asking UPS to fix their mess, since the product has already cleared customs and is sitting in Lima, Peru - don't know why). BUT, in any case, UPS can NOT be used for international shipping - USPS or FedEx should be used.

So shameless, UPS doesn't even care about reviews or ratings - no replies, no apologies! No longer a reliable, first-rate company, more like a fourth-rate company.

Added Feb 2, 2023:
Finally, I received an email from Union Pak, the Peru partner of UPS stating that the address didn't indicate the City of Trujillo so they will NOT deliver and wanted me to send someone to Lima to pick up the package (about 560 KM) (!). They sat on the package for a week before giving such a useless answer. And they don't care if you die, given the current violent situation in Peru but you must come to them - UNION PAK way or highway.

UPS USA: This clearly needs your intervention to tell your partner what needs to be done. I have already told Western Digital/SanDisk about this. Thanks.

Original Review:
Western Digital sent a replacement USB on Jan 17 to me in Peru. It reached Lima around Jan 21 and cleared customs around Jan 25. It's now over 2 weeks, and customs have been cleared for one week but still, the local partner wouldn't deliver it (they need to schedule the delivery). UPS will NOT take complaints by email (they must be getting thousands of complaints). No accountability and responsibility, only ""show me the money"".

I have asked Western Digital to discontinue using UPS and ask for damages."
"UPS delivered my item to a shop near me, which is something I did not ask them to do. I had a look at the details for the shop they had sent it to, details that they had sent and went to collect that weekend. When I got to the shop it was shut due to a family grievance. The card said collect in 7 days so I contacted UPS who said it would be ok to collect the following weekend. When I ended the call I received 2 texts from them. Later that month I received my bill and was charged £12.47 for the call and £2.50 for each of the texts they sent me. I contacted UPS via trust pilot and they seemed apologetic and told me to send all the details for them to sort it out. I received an email a few days later informing me that they would do nothing as per section 9.5 of their terms and conditions. I found section 9.5 and it is completely irrelevant to my situation.

They delivered to someone other than my address, somewhere that was not accessible at the times they advertised, I got charged £12.47 for calling them and then they sent 2 texts that I did not ask for which cost me a further £5. On top of that they had me waste time sending them details for no reason."
They lost my package then said I didn't have evidence it was picked up... which I did... They close the claim and you can't contact anyone about it. That's a crap way to treat a customer.
"Very bad customer service lose packages I ordered a new iPhone back in September for my birthday I return it because it was the wrong phone the wrong color so I called the company to return my phone gave me a label from my company the young man printed it out tell me I cannot ship the phone just in a box go buy a package Can I print out the label tell me it should be shipped back to the company from there it was October 4 after I am calling my company to see if my phone is back to the company so from there I’m going back-and-forth with the company UPS And T-Mobile Every time I will go back to the store some will tell me something different tell me the manager will call me or do you have to look inside and wait for the manager to come then I need the manager he tells me I have to call customer service I call customer service I am going back-and-forth they now me going back-and-forth with them they tell me now oh it’s not in my system no more we don’t see it now and they want to make me pay $1300 for iPhone that I do not have it makes me feel strange like someone stole it in UPS because it was strange the guy was strange in the UPS and then when I went there I never seen that guy again so are UPS people in Stealing peoples items

USPS loses 0 out of 1500. UpS loses 7 out of 8 packages and the one that got there took 6 weeks. shipped them at different times so it's not like they were on one truck that fell over. You go to file a claim and it's a scam.Itbsays you can't file a claim at this time on there website.cThen you spend 3 hours on the phone having them fill out claims. Then to get paid you have to fill out more paper work because it doesn't let you online. They try and send you forms but there not compatible to a phone. You have them sent by mail and they never sent them after calling them 7 times. They should go to jail for fraud. They do what ever they can to not pay you on claims UPS and eBay are the two worst companies in the planet. UPS should be investigated for fraud. They can go to hell and burn in the flames. Unorganized unethical company. Absolutely pathetic
This has been my ups for the last seven years I send things all the time to my other home in Montana and to my adult kids.I have a great relationships with the old staff now it’s all kids and they lack in customer satisfaction big time for the last seven years I’ve always taped my boxes up at this location now the new staff is telling me there going to have to charge me so I did not get my boxes taped up very well at all I know there going to bust open the girl was so dang rude when I told her that I need to tape up that opening she said it’s fine I told her it’s NOT I DONT MIND PAYING IF I HAVE TO BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS I NEVER EVEN BEEN TOLD THE TAPE IS EXTRA I BRING MY BOXES IN THE STORE OPEN SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT I HAVE IN THEM IT HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE BEFORE IM SO ANGRY HOW I WAS TREATED AND NOW IM CONCERNED THAT MY BOXES ARE GOING TO BRECK OPEN AND MY KIDS COLTHS ARE GOING TO GET LOST STOLEN WHATEVER AND IF THIS HAPPENS WELL THEY WILL SEE HOW UGHLY I CAN GET 13504 ne 84th st Vancouver Washington 98682
Ups Delivery guy threw my package across my walkway into my front door. To bad I can’t upload the video to show the world how unprofessional this was.
"Everyone I spoke with when I needed to reschedule my delivery has been very kind and helpful. Same for the driver who made sure to carry my parcels all the way to my apartment door since they were heavy. Although I missed the first delivery attempt and my parcels ended up in a service point, they arranged another home delivery without having to fight for it which has been the case with other logistics companies."
"I’ve decided to write this review for the sake of catharsis. I know that as merely the customer, my opinion falls in importance somewhere between that of the bloated dead carcass of a raccoon killed by a semi, and, a serial internet stalker living out his greasy existence in the basement of his mother’s boyfriend’s dilapidated poo box of a home.

But I need this, because screaming into the void is at least somewhat satisfying.

So, I shipped a valuable thing via 2nd day air. Guaranteed delivery on the second business day. Cool, cool-cool. So, like Monday dropped off to UPS and should arrive Wednesday (since I figured the 3rd business day made sense as a buffer - you know, because f me, right?).

Anyway, my tracking info updated today… Wednesday… says that the expected delivery is end of day tomorrow - so, 4th business day. Oh, and the location of my package: Effin Nowhere, Ohio, USA - a full 3.5 hour drive from where I live, which is near a major airport with a UPS terminal. Okay, cool, so drive my stuff 3.5 hours, a full day after it sat here in my hometown doing nothing, so that it can be flown out of someplace I’ve never heard of on the day it should be delivered… makes sense.

I call customer service and get the robot gate keepers, I’m calm at first, then progressively lose my… stuff…, screaming “representative” in shrill tones I reserve for the rare moment no one is around, because I’m going ape-******* at this point trying to rationalize the irrational.

An actual person finally gets on the line and proceeds to tell me that I dropped off the package too late on Monday (fair enough), and so it wouldn’t be shipped until the following day. Okay, so you have my package ready and waiting to be sent very first thing Tuesday AM and you do what? Oh, right, let it sit there for the entire day in the “label created” status, then, have the truck driver pick it up, drive it to an entirely different state where it now sits until, I’m assuming, based on the logic applied thus far, an effin yeti will show up, lug it into the northernmost regions of the continent, only to be dragged by a team of sled dogs through all of Canada and rural central United States before boarding a plane that will circumnavigate the globe before landing at a location that is neither closer, nor convenient in accommodating the “guarantee” of 2nd day delivery…

Anyway, that’s essentially what the customer service rep said. “Sorry, the truck driver gets to decide where they take it to be flown out from”… speechlessness ensued and an overwhelming realization that I’m dealing with expert-level ineptitude and resourceless-ness. It was like listening to the meandering non-sense justifications of cult followers immediately prior to the Kool-Aid going down the hatch - she was resigned to the nonsensical, and so too, must I be.

Anyway, because I had the audacity to look forward to something that was “guaranteed”, my week has been somewhat ruined. HOWEVER, I’m a grown man with good fortune and myriad things to be happy about. I choose my happiness. I just won’t be choosing UPS anymore."
"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY !
There methods are fraudulent. Taking payments from my bank account adding over £100 in extra charges for a parcel that was delivered 3 days late and damaged. I received no notification of extra charges . I spotted the payments (3 of them) on my banking app! Only when I made 3 calls and complained did I get an invoice with all the extra charges. I then emailed the CEO and I’m supposed to be getting a refund,which at the time of writing still hasn’t been paid!"
"They are useless. Horrible company. I wanted to send parcel abroad. I paid but then they had issue on their website and labels couldn't be generated. I emailed them, they didn't send me labels on time, collection was booked for next day, so I wanted to rebook it. I couldn't because their website was down. It took me a week to arranged new collection and when they came to collect it they refused to take my parcel because of missing documents. They send me only labels on my email without commercial invoice. e.g DPD does it for you they send you all needed paperwork. I was so frustrated so I wanted to cancel this but I had to pay extra £6 😤😤😤 I am not going to pay for their stupid issues. It's been more than a week now and I still didn't send my parcel or get my money back."
GRRRRR I CANT TELL HOW ANGRY I AM !!!! MY FRIEND BOUGHT A LOCK KIT FOR HER SKIDDER AND YOU INSIST YOU WANTED ANOTHER £136! AND THEN YOU LIED AND SAID SHE HAS'NT EVEN RUNG UP YOUR OFFICES TO SORT THIS MESS OUT GRRRRRRR!!!!!
If you buy something online ask for another postal service provider shocking customer service and terrible drivers who lie about delivering parcels and lie about even turning up to your address.l used to work for yodel for 3 years and that kind of practice was not allowed by any stretch of the imagination.lve resorted to contacting them on Instagram to try and get my single parcel delivered..ld rather buy another item then deal with this so called company again -3 stars you have been warned.
Website is clear and easy to navigate and explanation on the various products is well detailed. Order arrived timely and well packaged.
Laughably bad company. They lost track of my parcel as soon as it was handed over from Amazon. Don't know how they are still in business looking at all the options here. Their tracking gives hardly any information at all and I've wasted days being led to believe my parcel was going to be delivered only to be informed late at night that there was a delay. Abysmal
"Next day delivery is not next day delivery

Fed ex is better than you, I hope Amazon puts you all out of business and the CEO hangs himself I’ll even give him the rope."
I filed a claim with UPS over 2 months ago. When I check my claim status online it says claim under review. I feel they have had enough time to have inspected the damaged package and it's contents by now. Each time I call their customer service the automated system says they can't connect me with a customer representative. I slowly say my tracking number but each time it says I didn't get that. Then it says to call back with the tracking number and hangs up on me. No matter what I try the same thing happens everytime and it hangs up on me. I can not get through to a customer representative no matter how hard I try. I payed $58.00 out of my owe pocket to make sure the item would be shipped safely to my customer. UPS failed to do that. My customer messaged me the item delivered by UPS was broken. A beautiful antique lionshead lamp. I did what I was suppose to do and filed a claim to get my $58 shipping charge refunded to me. I have had no luck with that. Now my problem is I trusted UPS to stand behind their shipping policy and so far they have failed miserably. I will never trust them with my shipping needs again. They basically have stolen $58 from me and I am past frustrated. I can't get any help at with my claim only a automated voice that can't understand plain English that rudely hangs up on you.
"I've seen the parody videos about how terrible UPS treats packages. There is more truth than humor to them. I shipped a $250 dollar sewing machine to a customer. I had to custom build a wooden box to ship it in. I've done a lot of carpentry work in my life. When my customer received the package, the bottom of the crate was missing and the wooden base of the machine was broken. They left it in pieces on her doorstep. As if they were unaware it was broken.
When I called to put in a claim it seems there was no English speaking representatives that I could talk to. It turns out that all of their complaints are handled overseas. I was told several times that someone would call me right back. No one ever did. Now I am out $250 for all my time and labor. I will NEVER use UPS again. And if someone ships anything to my store again I will request any shipper but UPS. The last person I spoke to said he was from Guatemala and refused to do anything for me."
"You already have the report of severe damage to the shipping container and damage to the cowling for the pedals & flywheel for the stationary Bike. It was impossible to use the original shipping container, so was returned in a modified box. Wayne Brower"
They got my package from Microsoft last night and they delivered it exact time that they have said and it was great :).
does not delivery on guaranteed date! you can not rely on this company if you have urgent deliveries
Scam. They have stolen my luggage.
"Delivered on the day stated and delivery man ery pleasant. However, I would have liked a time range of even 1 hour to plan the rest of my day. I would have given 5 stars had that been the case."
"Terrible company!!! The packaging was delayed for more than a MONTH!!! The support service simply does not respond, letters are ignored. They don't even deserve one star!"
Very late delivery. The priority should be to deliver mails and documents before packages.
If I could leave a negative star I would. Calling their customer service line is a joke. I cannot reach anybody.
My driver is awful! The customer service of the local office is terrible. They hold your packages hostage so they dont have to deliver them. Its awful! Go with USPS !
"Trying to contact UPS customer service is a nightmare. Amazon has given me THREE different numbers now to use. Each one connects me with an automatic voice system that can't understand anything I'm saying. Then it pushes me into a listen-and-reject-options queue that wastes time. It actually told me, ""I know you want to speak with a person but I can't connect you unless I know more about what you need help with."" But it can't understand basic English! After 20-minutes of futile speak-and-be-misunderstood, I just hung up. Can't contact an agent.

Now that Amazon has stopped supporting charities important to our family and one UPS Store after another in our city has shut down permanently, we have an even bigger incentive to stop shopping online. When something goes wrong, returns are a headache. Trying to get help from UPS when you need it has just become too hard now that they're shoving customers off onto a poorly functioning ""AI"" voice-system and preventing us from contacting live agents."
Worst company ever. The courier pretend to pass by but in reality he never pass. A simple deliver takes more than 20 days.
"I received a parcel from eBay (UK) on the 18-01-2023 and I returned it on 19-01-2023 at a UPS drop off with the label provided by the seller.

Subsequent to several enquiries and complaints to the eBay seller (and writing to UPS), the parcel was still not returned to the seller.

On 30-01-2023, I received an email from UPS saying, 'Based on our records, the delivery failed do to missing or illegible label. Please confirm the delivery address and I will send a request to redeliver this package.'

UPS 's excuse for the failure to properly deliver the package was disingenuous to say the least.

Fortunately, I had taken pictures of the packaging that clearly showed there was no damage to the label, and nor was the address illegible, and nor was it missing. Furthermore, the address and the label were covered over in transparent sellotape for protection: with the exception of the bar code and QR code.

I think this is disgusting behaviour on the part of UPS, and I hope they will admit to their incompetence and irresponsibility as it concerns the handling of my package.

Personally speaking, I shall never send anything with this company.

I had an issue with a package that was being handed over to USPS that's now actually lost. There was no way to actually reach a customer service rep with UPS to help resolve the matter. This is not okay.
The order was supposed to arrive 5 days ago but the delivery guy just keeps pushing the arrival date. I called them 2 times and the lady on the phone said that the courier delayed the arrival of the package because he doesn’t have enough packages to come to my address and he wait for more packages. Unreal. Unprofessional. 1star
Waiting for three weeks now and going for a package that needed to go through customs. Could have been a day but no way to communicate with these people. Emails are ignored and customer service on phone has no idea what they're doing. One even pretended to not be able to hear me! Tracking state is contradicting and contains lies.
"My orders were being sent by UPS from different vendors. They managed to destroy three different electronic items. Further, under UPS rules I could never track down the vendors because there were no names required from the shipper UPS. I went back and forth with them as high in the chain of management as I could. I even posted bad reviews everywhere I could find including Facebook and Twitter. My loss just in the value of the items was about $350.00. My loss of time was ridiculous. I finally gave but instructed as many vendors NOT to ship anything to me by UPS."
Ups is honestly just garbage. I don't understand how they even have business at this point. They can never give you straight answers and no one knows who to talk to. The center doesn't answer calls even from the supervisor. We've had a medication delivered the same way in December and now its a problem with the address when it hasn't been changed. I've spoken to 4 different customer service reps and 1 person from a store because it's medication we are waiting for that has been missed for over 2 weeks. We confirmed a address over 10 times and it is still saying something wrong with the address. This is ridiculous and it takes me being loud and ghetto for anyone to give me straight answers. This is someone's life they are playing with and IT IS NOT OK! I'm starting to think legal action is the only way we get what should've been done weeks ago. We do everything they told us to and still no medication. 1st supervisor never called back and the 2nd one was the one who said the center wasn't answering. I absolutely hate doing business with them and if I don't get the medication and some concrete answers on Monday I will see my legal options. Someone shouldn't have to suffer in pain and being uncomfortable because a company can't get it together and fix their mistake. Trust and believe I will finding a way to receive this medication in the future without using Ups cause they don't care and they don't try to fix their mistakes it's all on the receiver to fix it and suffer. This is the absolute worst experience a company this big has given me.
"I wish I had used a different provider. UPS is so so so awful. Customer service is unresponsive and it is very hard to talk to someone when things go wrong.

Paid premium for a fast delivery and the delivery is now 4 days late and counting. On top of that, they are trying to charge me import customs tax of 699GBP on a gift to myself with no commercial value (1EUR symbolic value on the forms). I have not received an answer to my dispute on this yet, 2 days later, and I will be extremely angry if delivery is refused because of this.

To top it, their tracking service is the worst I have ever seen and as a result I have been expecting the package daily staying at home and affecting my business.

0 STARTS IF I COULD."
"I ordered a lot of nail products from Ukraine, to have something to work with. So this parcel was going to Canada by Meest corporation. But they can bring it only to Toronto and from there they just send this package by UPS. My package was sended on January 11. Estimated delivery date was January 17. (It looks like they go by bicycle) But ok, doesn't matter, of course my package wasn't delivered. By the way, I called them on January 16 just to check where it should be delivered, cause on their website wasn't any information, only ""Calgary AB'. They check an address and told me ""no worries, it gonna be delivered in time"". So I called them on January 17th at 6p.m. (they work to 7) and asked about my package, because I was fully booked for next day. They told me ""your package is out for delivery today, so you should receive today or tomorrow"". In next day there wasn't estimated delivery time on their website. So I called them again and get exactly the same answer ""it's out for delivery today"". So in third day i was already very angry and I started understand that they just lie to me to take some time. I called them a few times this day and finaly some girl told me that a can make a claim and then they will find and bring my package urgently. I didn't want to do this, but I made this claim. Next day in the afternoon i called them again. And they told me ""oh, it's not true, it was a mistake, your investigation will take 8 business days"" tadadada... i asked to cancel this claim and just bring my package, but shr told me that the best way for me is just wait. So then I directly asked if they lost this package, and only then they said ""yes"". Ok... After 5 days i got the e-mail that my investigation was closed. I finaly feld myself a little better. I called to this familiar number and asked ""does it mean that you found my package?"" Thay said ""yes, but we need around 3 days to make some paper work and we need to contact a shipper for additional information."" Next day I contacted Meest corporation by myself and asked if they already provided this information. Meest told me that they will contact UPS right now and than call me back. I got this call after 15-20 min and they told me that they gave all the information that they had, but if I know what exactly is in my package I can contsct UPS and maybe it gonna help. I called UPS again to provide an information, but they just told me that somebody will contact me today to add this information to my claim. Of course nobody called me and estimated delivery day wasn't provided. So today I called them again. Aaaaand.... They told me ""It was some mistake, this investigation wasn't closed, it still opened. So you have to wait 2 days more"". Honestly, this is a most horrible delivery service I ever had. Please, save your mental health, time and money - DON'T USE UPS. By the way, the last information about my package - ""arrived at facillity in Calgary Jan16"". This package came through half planet, through 3 borders and customs and was lost by UPS in the destination."
"They don’t call, doesn’t matter for the agents if the package have to return to the other side of the planet.. horrible service and experience! Don’t ever ship to Finland with this company!"
"What a bunch of thieves. I paid over $50 for 2nd air. Then for no explained reason they delayed my package. Now it will be 7 days to get my package. They don't answer the phones,they do not care that they flat out stole my money. I needed the package on Friday. Now it will not be here till Wednesday. This is the fourth time in a row they have delayed something for no reason. They should change their name to useless parcel service. Nothing but frauds and liars."
Mike from cottonwood heights area code 84121 is an amazing UPS delivery man! We love our Mike. It was one of our employees last day and he made sure to make her feel special by getting her cookies for her new adventure in life. We don't want any other driver but Mike! :)
"The worse company for shipment! DONT USE UPS ! And their customer service is seriously disgusting! All their staff are rude and unhelpful, they hang up on you in the middle of conversation"
"UPS is the absolute worst when it comes to customer service and competency. Another lost package in Gainesville, GA facility! Absolute worst in the country! Make things even better, my UPS rep for my business is no where to be found. I am switching to FedEx and possible lawsuit against UPS! Absolutely unbelievable!"
Hopeless company. Avoid at all costs.
"Useless, delayed and unable to work things smoothly as always"
Kept me updated on delivery status every step of the way. Great service
"This is the worst delivery company, they never deliver on time, issue here is when buy something, you cannot choose the carrier :("
"If i could give 0 stars i would
They're just liars and very unprofessional"
"When it comes to delivering packages, UPS is the totally incompetent regardless if you leave delivery instructions to call you when they are outside an apartment and can not access the building. Every other delivery service is able to deliver packages except UPS. Use any other carrier before you use UPS."
Have received orders a couple of times and had issues which you cannot get resolved because YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO A LIVE PERSON when the website and support both tell you they can not help.
"Horrible company!!
DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.
package not delivered, then sent back to sender...no text, no phone call, no 'come pick it up'.
Very difficult to speak with a person in complaints.
...never again...choose another company."
"If the company is not able to fulfil its only duty to deliver the packages, it should try doing something else.

It’s been days I keep being promised my parcel will be delivered and I keep not getting it.

It’s unfair to keep customers waiting in all day, at least they could send a delay/ no show up message.

It makes sense though they don’t as I was told on the phone that they don’t have any way to track or contact drivers."
"They don’t even try to call you and report to Amazon that you were not at home or that the address is incorrect.
Currier in charge of delivery super rude"
"It's too bad I have do give one star to UPS. I have never ever received a delivery on time from them. Sometimes they try to deliver on the right date, but outside national opening hours. Customer service are rude, and don't give a... about the customer. Why on earth does Apple use this UPS for accessories when they use DHL for their main devices? DHL have excellent service, and are always on time. UPS have one job, and are failing every single time."
The worst courier company I have used.... Pre authorise payments and deduct further money from your account with no reasoning. No UPS driver collected the my parcel from a UPS access point for a full week ..... So I went back to pick up my parcel and send with another company. They refused to send me a refund.
"As usual, I got a message saying that an attempted delivery was made, but I was home at the time, so I know this is not true. No prewarning of delivery. So as usual, I have to call customer support the next day and have them instruct the driver to leave the package on the door step. Their internet site is a nightmare to navigate through.... Can not recommend."
"UPS in Sweden. Blatant lies about attempts to deliver the package home, and nobody present at home to receive the package. This has happened EVERY INSTANCE I have been a package receiver from UPS. Trash company that saves man-hours of their delivery service and asks you to collect the package from some god-forsaken remotely located service points.

Dear e-shop managers/owners: please stop using UPS, you are loosing customers to competition because of UPS business practices."
"They couldn't get our address right
Said final attempt to deliver made despite never showing up
Have called 5 times! And still no parcel

Am fuming"
"Avoid UPS for all costs. We personally delivered our passports at Økeren. The staff is a joke, that can't provide information about their service. We requested a return label. The staff charged NOK instead of CHF, resulting in the return label being marked unpaid. Ordered a new return label. Our passports were picked up at the Mali Embassy in Geneva by UPS but never scanned. UPS claimed it was never picked up. A week later I found out they used the ""unpaid label"". At Pick up point in Oslo they didn't have that package even though UPS claimed it was delivered. The problem was the service point couldn't scan all UPS labels. I used an hour looking through all packages. At the UPS customer service, there was no help, just to create a new claim, which answer was ""we need a proof we picked up your passports"". Prove. I got my passports after looking through hundreds of packages with an angry owner behind me. UPS is a place that absolutely able to steal passports and important documents, with no customer service at all, claiming you are the problem. Avoid UPS at all costs."
worst customer service ever. I ADVISE YOU NOT TO USE THIS SERVICE! better of sending a pigeon!!
Total reluctance to contact costumers about the package meanwhile every other company has it in their service to give an easy and uninterrupted communication to get the package the fastest was possible. Costumer service is polite but they also boldly lie into the telephone saying that no other company has it priced in to contact costumers in case of delivery. Bad service compared to others. If i can choose between couriers i go for anything but them.
"This company is terrible.
They messed up my eight deliveries. Whenever I order from Amazon or Apple and my delivery is provided by UPS - I know there will be problems with it.
Every time something needs to be delivered, drivers mark that they lack some information on the day of delivery and I have to call Customer Support to solve problems. Usually, they're missing the phone number. I provided CS with the phone number for my recent delivery, so they promised to deliver it the next day, which didn't happen. Instead, two days after, they brought it to the Parcel Shop, which is 40 minutes away from my home(the original address of the delivery). I recommend everybody avoid using this company!!!"
"I have a very long driveway (about a 1/4 mile long) that is gated. When I am expecting a delivery, I leave the gate open. UPS NEVER drives in to deliver--instead the driver leaves it out by the highway for me to come out to pick up. I've tried to contact UPS about it, but it's nearly impossible to get through to them. I also don't have any neighbors near me to trust receiving packages. I much prefer FEDEX or USPS."
"Similar to a lot of comments in this thread. I have had multiple ""delivery attempts"" I have security cameras, so I can see when delivery attempts are made.

There has been a total of 1 delivery attempt made which was last week. They claim that they have made 3. At no point, was it communicated to me that they would be delivering on that day.

On the one genuine delivery attempt I received a slip in my mailbox, that I could complete the form and provide my authority to leave. I completed the form and stuck that form to my front door.

I also rang, after the first ""delivery attempt"" which was not made. And arranged for the delivery to be made to my work address.

I am now being advised that my package will be returned to sender, after a month of dealing with their nonsense.

I will be writing to the company I order my product from to describe my terrible experience and will strongly recommend that they find a delivery partner who is capable of doing their job."
No sense of customer. Wanted $1 for a small piece of tape to close a box.
"The company is lying about attempting to deliver packages. People that live in apartments are not getting appropriate delivery. If someone pays for signature delivery, the package is stuck in a locker and not delivered to the door. I work from home. My mother is retired and my nephew is home schooled. Someone is always at my apartment. My sister has had items returned because someone said she called and said she would pick up the items. Her car was totaled in November. I don't understand how she will pick up items without a vehicle. You never receive a follow up call, email or a refund for the delivery."
"Absolute worst company ever. Screwed up ""every"" delivery I have ever been forced to receive from them. Total incompetence."
didn't show up to pick up a package at my home so many times after they pronised.
"I do not know how to make my address any more clear than it already is on the package. I'm not sure if people these days are just dumb, don't want to do thier job, or they seriously just don't know how to read an address. Then when you call because they need MORE information there is nobody to speak with. I am going to contact Amazon and let them know NOT to use UPS. I am definitely NOT buying if UPS is going to be delivering. I order for convenience and then I get the stress of having to find my packages.Thanks UPS!!!!"
Takes forever and they always delay packages
"UPS were entrusted with a parcel for delivery in Colombia. They were given the delivery address and full recipient contact details, phone and email. On their tracking page UPS claimed to have attempted delivery, but no contact was made with recipient and the neighbours saw nothing of UPS. An alternative delivery address, that is occupied 24/7 was provided with the same result. UPS claimed to have attempted delivery twice, but again no delivery driver called at the address and no attempt was made to contatct the recipient. I was given phone numbers for the Colombian UPS office in order to make contact to resolve things, but all numbers supplied either didn't connect or just rang, unanswered, when dialling from UK or Colombia.I emailed UPS head office in South America in English and in Spanish, no reply. Through contact with UPS helpdesk in UK I learned that the parcel had not even cleared customs, so no delivery attempts could have been made. No customs invoice was sent to the recipient or to me to pay any duty owed. UPS stopped the fictional delivery attempts and said that the parcel could only be retrieved from their facility in Bogota. When asked for a phone number the same useless numbers were supplied again. When asked for the address of the UPS office nothing was provided.Then I received a return tracking number. This showed the parcel got as far as Kansas City where it was declared 'abandoned'. I offered to pay to have the parcel returned to me. I was told this was not possible as it had been abandoned, by UPS in their own facility. I began to doubt my own sanity and no amount of pleading would get them to return the parcel to me from Kansas City. Either the parcel had been opened and the contents stolen, making UPS unwilling to be exposed to a compensation claim, or they are the most messed up courier company on Earth. I doubt that they even have a Colombian office, such is the paranoia they can induce in this customer. The delivery was booked with UPS by a third party handler called Parcel Compare. That is another totally inept operation, strangely well suited to work in cooperation (confusion?) with UPS"
"Recently I had an Amazon return of a very large, awkward purchase, a king size mattress topper. I spoke to Amazon several times about how to package and return. The return had to be to a UPS store. To make sure I was doing everything correctly, I called the UPS store at 3440 Lehigh St., Allentown, PA. ( store 2756 ). I spoke to Yekainia. What a wonderful representative! She was very patient with me as I picked her brain, told her what Amazon instructed me to do, etc. She was very knowledgeable, helpful and made me feel quite at ease with this awkward return. I packed the topper as instructed and took it into the UPS store on Saturday, January 21. I was able to meet Yekainia and she was super with helping me. Kudos to Yekainia!!!
She is a valuable customer service representative for UPS. Please acknowledge her in some way! You need more people like her!
Thank you,
Donna in Allentown"
"They keep claiming that they tried to deliver my package and that I wasn't there.

But I work from home. Every single day. I've never missed a package from other companies.

I also collect packages for all my neighbors because I'm always here.

Nobody from UPS has rung my doorbell. Nobody."
"My delivery was confirmed for Fri 20th Jan 23 and I was in all day waiting. I then got a message saying it couldn’t be delivered as there was no-one in. I was very cross. I rearranged the delivery for Mon 23rd Jan 23. As it hadn’t arrived by 2pm I telephoned customer services and said that a ‘ticket’ would be sent to the warehouse. The item arrived at 2.50pm.
Would be helpful if there was the facility to have ‘live tracking’ as other large delivery companies have."
They lost a piece of art or somebody stole it because I thought it was pretty probably opened the package and decided to keep it for themselves. I suppose it’s what UPS drivers do sometimes how do I know but UPS is not wanting to give me money back because I can’t produce the receipt and my son-in-law brought it over 20 years ago. I was mailing it to him so that he can put it in his office in Virginia. I’m heartbroken that it was lost and its value is invaluable because my son-in-law I really liked it.
Shame on UPS. Don’t ship UPS to Chicago. Third time package disappeared. They have a Chicago problem. This was a package for someone fighting cancer from me a cancer patient as well. Take your job seriously because it matters.
"One star is too high, as previous reviewers, UPS is a ZERO star rated delivery service. Package was sitting at local distribution centre 4 weeks UPS claiming 'undeliverable civic address'.......Google map of the address shows the house frontage so what is UPS's problem?? Called Customer Service every day for nearly 2 weeks, online tracking page useless and not updated. When package finally arrived it was filthy, kicking around inside the van?, and had 7 'HOLD' stickers showing the CORRECT address. I just hope the package contents have not been damaged, time will tell."
"UPS LETS STRANGERS AND EMPLOYEES GO THROUGH PACKAGES AND RETAPED THEM...

SERIOUSLY IS THIS ALL THE DEVIL HAS TO DO WITH HIS TIME?"
"I have packages delivered and shipped all the time, UPS is the only delivery service that seems to know how to do their job. They strive to get packages delivered in a timely manner and definitely treat packages in their possession with more care than any other delivery service. Their delivery and customer services are far more superior than any other delivery services available!"
Send packages back to sender without notification!! Do not notify that an access point can’t accept your packages (why can’t the access point accept the packages though?!???) Very frustrating that I have to deal with this as a receiver for 3 packages in a row now and I didn’t even choose to use them.
"I called the company to ask them to deliver to a neighbour, to get through to customer services in India. They said they could do this. Next thing you know I get a delivery notice that they failed the delivery, when I know for sure my neighbour is in."
"insane service ,it was first and last time for me to use this service ."
"If I could give zero stars I would.
No attempt made to deliver on two recent deliveries from Bose - claimed no-one at home when we waited in on both occasions. Just dumped the parcel in their local pick-up point and claimed they were unable to deliver after two attempts. I then have to go to the pick up point to collect a heavy parcel, which should have been delivered. DO NOT USE UPS - They are rubbish."
"If it would be possible to give «0» stars I would. I thought this is a serious company, but NO. DON’T use them!!! Can’t trust anything they say. Payed extra for 24h express. This is a week ago!! Parcel still «on the way». No explaination why. Nothing. Very unreliable."
"this is not a business you're dealing with the people , i have been driving for 70km for finding an ups access point for sending my free company's damn package and i didn't find anyone every address i head to is closed or not even exist...damn w.tf you think you doing with us"
"I have had a package in Denver since Thursday. It went out for delivery Friday, nothing. Went out again Saturday. Still nothing. I needed these items for school. Your customer service has been less then helpful. Im tired of paying so much money for such terrible service. This is the last straw, I refuse to support you clowns again!"
"This is the fourth time UPS didn't deliver my package saying no one was home. I've been home all day. Besides, don't they leave the package anyway? I'm so upset. They also said it was their second attempt which is a lie because package was ordered 1/19/2023 and was supposed to arrive 1/21/2023. Now I have to wait til Monday and I probably won't get it then which means I'll have to go pick it up. Not happening. I try not to use ups. They really suck! What a huge disappointment they are. I hope they figure out what's going on."
"I don't use UPS, I didn't receive a package when I was home waiting for it. The same thing happened today. I was told a Dispatcher would give me a call to which they never did, per the agent I spoke to they wrote on their notes that they called. They never did that's why I ended calling back. I don't recommend UPS for anyone service is horrible."
you guys suck at communication and your delivery times are garbage you guys need to run a tighter schedule and not be so garbage at your jobs.
I am so upset with UPS. I tracked my package daily. Was told package would arrive by 01/21/2023. Today 01/21 I am being told delivery was ATTEMPTED on 01/20. I was home all day. No delivery was attempted. Now I am being told my package won't be here until Tuesday 01/24. WTH is this? I am working on a baby shower gift. I need my purchase. This is the second time UPS has Screwed me. They left no information as to where or what UPS location my order is nor a phone number to contact for pickup. Just there STUPID AUTOMATED SYSTEM WHICH IS NO HELP AT ALL. WHERE THE HELL IS MY PACKAGE UPS?
Went to pick up my package at an access point and it was my medication for the month one bottle of 100 oxycodone 10 mg was stolen and it was done during the shipping process and they just flipped the flap back over and put some clear tape on it how did they even have time to go through this bag that had three different bottles of medication and then retape it they might need to do some drug testing
UPS delayed my package due to a sortation error. It was supposed to be delayed one day. Now it is sitting at a location still being processed when it could have been delivered today.
"Excellent and trustworthy company, advance notice of delivery sent by e mail with a time slot which was adhered to."
"I’m nearly 40, and have had thousands of packages delivered to me since the birth of ebay, let alone Amazon. Of the big 3(FedEx, USPS, UPS), UPS is, OVERWHELMINGLY, the worst. No matter what time of year, if I have to depend on their service, I am disappointed. Literally 90%+ of their deliveries are late. Not a little late, but at least 4+ days late. AT LEAST 1/2 the packages are banged up, often affecting their contents. Last, but not least, is their utter disregard for instructions. Never, literally NEVER, have they ever followed any instructions I’ve given. Why do they even still exist?"
"I had a package delivered to my home and it was raining cats and dogs, lol. The delivery person left the package on my porch, wrapped in plastic, so it wouldn’t get wet!! I was so surprised at the extra customer care that was given to my package. A very happy GA customer. I see you train your delivery drivers to care. Thank you for GREAT customer service 🙏🏾"
Utterly dire service. Lost my parcel and it’s ache trying to contact UPS without wasting time with awful BOTs.
"If I could put zero stars I would. I’ll live in Florida, but I am currently in the state of North Carolina with family member who is in hospice care right now. I had to ship my rent through them and I sent it out last Monday. I got a notification on Wednesday stating that my package had been delivered so I didn’t go and worried. So I got a phone call two days ago on Wednesday and my apartment complex tells me that they didn’t get my package and if my rent is not paid by Friday, which is today that I would be kicked out of my apartment. So I called their customer service number spent an hour on the phone with their representatives to where they told me that there was no apartment number when there wasn’t supposed to because I was sending it directly to my leasing office and that it was being held. I never got an email or phone call stating that my package was being held. So she transferred me to someone else and they changed it to my physical address and they assured me that it would be delivered today. So I’m sitting in hospice with my family member and I get a phone call from the UPS store in North Carolina saying that my package has been sent back. I just spent another 30 minutes on the phone with a representative for them to tell me that I’m pretty much out of luck and now I have to pay almost $100 to get my package overnighted, or I get kicked out of my apartment. I will never use UPS again, and I will make sure to never recommend it to anybody again."
"The worst company ever
They demanded more money for custom fees
I felt blackmail
The didn't give me my parcel
Very bad experience"
"Serious integrity issues with ups, they make their life easier by delivering to my corner shop rather than my house then the system says no answer from my door, happens every time with them. My cctv proves they are lying. Poor customer service, poor delivery and poor service provider. Horrible totally."
"Worst delivery company

I was meant to have my parcel delivered yesterday at 10.30, but it never came.The tracking information just said out for delivery. Wasted my entire day & today the tracking showed that they will delivered today, I have call their customer team and they have informed that it’s not going to deliver it today and it will be on Monday.

Wasted my time and money, worst experience & never ever recommended."
Poor tracking system and no option to contact driver
"I can't even describe how much stress and anxiety I've been through trying to send a package from the UK to USA with UPS, AVOID, AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Customer service is totally pointless and just tells you lies, they had my package for a month in the airport warehouse and declined to ship it due to the battery it had in it. When you contact customer services you're told someone will contact you back, this never ever happens. You can call them everyday and you'll get the same answer or they'll put the phone down on you. There is no one in the UK you can speak to and no way of speaking to UPS directly at the airport even though the UPS base there is enormous. I had to go and pick my package up myself that they said they would destroy if I didn't.
Worst experience I've ever had to go through and would give 0 stars if possible."
After a missing package in past they said they'd refund retailer who would have give me compo not them. Though they weren't helpful. Now After mymallbox has lost a expensive package with asendia theyve shipped a single item out with ups . Which I can say has arrived in just a couple of days. Bravo. Let's hope the next package mymallbox has is as successful & by them as im due away soon and I will up another star
"We were shipping up to 100 packages per day through them and paying them to pick up our packages. Three times during the Christmas rush, they neglected to pick them up, which hurts our Amazon rating. We cancelled with them, but they continue to bill us and have even had collections call us about pickup fees for after cancellation. To make it worse, they were delivering packages to us yesterday and we had some going out, knowing they would be here to deliver packages. The driver REFUSED to take out outgoing packages, saying that we weren't paying for a pickup, so he wouldn't take ours, even though he was here already, as it costs the company money if we don't have for pickup. So we had to drive them into town to the UPS store. USPS gets all of our packages from here on out and there are days when that can be up to 300 packages in one day."
"UPS lied to me.

they said they would deliver a package tonight and of course they didn't.

I wasted my whole day because of that awful shyster lier company.

I hope you scumbags go bankrupt.

Avoid using ups"
0 star service drivers follow no instructions not even from the UPS service customer care. loosing packages from UPS is common
"The location in Millington is the most racist location I have ever been to. Stephanie refused to refund me on a passport photo that was denied by the Federal Post Office. Stephanie told me she used her camera and film. Surely,I am not the only person this tragic has happened to. Are you that money hungry Stephanie?"
Worst delivery company operating in Denmark. I was suppose to get a package today. They sent me an email stating delivery would take place between 10-14. I stayed home and no one came by. 14:30 I called customer service. They told be package was late but would be delivered to my address later today. 17:00 I get an email saying I wasn’t home and I need to pick the package up myself. That’s such a lie! UPS was on TV in Denmark recently for same lies. Liars. Liars liars!!! Shame on you.
Delivered a parcel from a retailer on the day requested BUT I asked for it to be put in cupboard if no one in. What actually happened was he/she knocked on door and left parcel on doorstep even although I was on way to answer it-didn't even wait 1 minute for answer! Also poor tracking-no idea when they will turn up and noticed they didn't take photo as proof of delivery! Ref: 1Z5904R66849251412
"I think UPS is the worst delivery service out there and their drivers are liars, I sat in my living room all day waiting on a package saw nobody but when I check my phone in the evening there was a message from UPS saying they try to deliver my package and no one was home they even said they leave a note on my door which was a lie, I called there customer service twice and they said somebody would call me and they never did."
They've lost my packages several times already or delivered them to the wrong address if they were delivered at all. I doubt they care at all.
"I was meant to have my parcel delivered today at 10.30, but it never came. I emailed them and contacted their social media teams, but no one replied and no one told me where my parcel was. The tracking information just said out for delivery. I then get an email at about 22.30 telling me my delivery is ow coming the following day at 10.30. thanks for wasting my entire day waiting on this delivery"
The driver was very personable and friendly. Great delivery experience!
This company looses 3/4 of the packages they are shipping to me.
"UPS delivered to the wrong location and when I called to get more information I went directly to the electronic help system. I asked multiple times to be connected with human customer service representative and each time I was disconnected after being told by a machine to log onto the system to contact support.

I logged on and contacted support - had to fill out another form but got a call from a human - who told me that due to the issue it would be the responsibility of the shipper to keep me apprised of the open ticket investigation. That was the end of the conversation - but when I went to use the automatic questionnaire on service it disconnected.

This is the worst possible experience in customer service and operation I've had in some time. It amazes me how bad this was."
"Very bad I called 20 times wait for many days never get help from officer just lied each time for pass the time , every day told me gonna delivery today sure sure , finally never , told gonna call me never too . Even call 20 times never get help and get parcel yet 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"I am sitting at home waiting for my package while this message pops up. Studip lazy delivery guy! ¨


""The status of your package has changed.

Exception Reason: Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer pick up."""
"slow, tracking sucks, in general the worst option"
"Sent parcel 06/01/2023 parcel not delivered yet.
The tracking number status is Delay.
Customer service just ignores all the messages"
"The UPS courier says he tried to deliver my package and I wasn't home. I was outside the door for two hours waiting for him, and the worst part is that UPS returned the package to the sender the same day. It doesn't deserve a star."
"Shocking, awful service, how do these people NOT CARE??"
"I visited the UPS store on Shea Boulevard off 32nd in Phoenix and had a horrible experience. The clerk who assisted me acknowledged that I was being charged while she insisted on helping another customer with a process that she obviously didn’t understand it took a long time for her to return to assist me, and once I was finished the system charged my card almost $50 for what amounted to about 15 minutes. I’ll never return to the UPS store again and I’m having to contest the charges with my bank."
"Refused to let me pick up my package after multiple days of not being able to deliver it for whatever reason. I called them twice and got nowhere until I spoke to a manager who told me they would call back in an hour with why my package keeps being delayed and how I’ll be able to obtain it, hours later still no call back. This is the WORST delivery system DONT USE UPS if you have a chance, poor delivery and customer service."
"There is noone to talk to there. The customer service line is an automated system that will not get you to a live person. My issue can only be resolved by a live person. Yes, it happens! Technology does not fix everything. I can't give the recording a tracking number that I don't have! Using one I do have, it still won't get me to a person. It wants me to file a claim. I don't need to file a claim. I need the driver to come back. Good thing he didn't drop his wallet or phone, he'd never get it back with their customer service. Jeesh! Customer service line is a joke! So is the email option. Maybe don't listen to a laborer working on a house and pay more attention to the address on the package."
Delivered parcel to wrong address after 3 missed delivery dates and then opened ‘an investigation’ to determine what happened which means after 3 weeks still haven’t had a refund or exchange for an item bought as a birthday gift
"Tracking was uninformative and delivery late
Package arrived in Dublin Depot at 14.00 on 12/1
I received email notification it would be delivered that evenng
Was due 13/1.
Was actually delivered 16/1"
I had an Amazon return and had never done something like that before. The person at UPS was soooo helpful and patient and even advised me on an upcoming USPS return that I had to do. I had messed up the labeling and the young man fixed everything and was nice about the whole thing.
Terrible service logging in. Website malfunction. Overnight package shipped 1/14. Still not here on 1/16 days delivery coming on 1/17!
"Despite my negative experience, the country manager has sincerely apologized and let the team deliver the package. So my previous comment was an exception."
"Apex NC Store: Shipment to Atlanta GA was reportedly damaged and discarded from 10/12/22- no refund to date. Manager Judith refused to file claim. Tried to contact owner John at The UPS Store Cameron Village, NC, he too failed to respond to my phone calls and emails. This is the worst shipping experience in all my life."
"The company should be shut down. All the workers there are cheaters. My package has been with them since 9th January and everyday I call them they just ignore me and tell me it will come next day. Then it doesn't come the next day. And on the tracking it says a second attempt. There was no first attempt in the first place. I tell them that and they say sorry it’s a mistake on their system. The diver person is a liar he says he knocked on my door and I didn’t answer. There was no proof of that. He could have taken a picture shows that he came or called as they told me the driver will call me 1 hour before. BUT THEY ARE CHEATERS!!!!! now on the website says ( The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible ) this is very unprofessional!!! They expect me to stay home all day all week wait for them and give them money for being late!!!!
I wish there was 0 starts so I can give them!!!!!!!!
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
"Got a message your parcel will be delivered at the end of day. Rescheduled to the next day. Got a message saying an exception had occurred, the parcel will be delayed by 1 working day. Then that was changed to we'll advise you of a delivery date. Had someone stay in for 2 days and still no parcel. Absolutely ridiculous."
"Ryan was Super nice and very helpful and patient with me, you have an excellent employee working for UPS. He's a great asset to your company. He works at store located at 10650 culebra rd ste 104, San Antonio Texas 78251."
"Ups is the worst delivery service ever!
From delivering to the wrong apartment to customer service lying twice stating that a manager would call me back within a min hr. To the lack of accountability and accessibility I hope my packages never have to go through such a poor company and service"
"Why do you not deliver packages? You just take them to the drop off point and deliver stickers to the address instead. Even though I am waiting for you at the front??? If I am paying for a service, then why am I serving myself... 1/5 would not recommend go with cheaper and better couriers if possible."
"I got a slip on my door Wed for a package that required a signature. I signed it. The next day a got another one - no explanation, no other options. I signed that as well and noted that I would work from home to take delivery on Friday. No delivery attempt was made. I spent 20 minutes on the phone and their ONLY option was for me to drive 1.5hr round trip to pick the package up. They REFUSED to reattempt delivery, delivery to my office or a retail location. UPS DOES NOT DELIVER PACKAGES!"
"The rates from higher and higher and the service gets slower and slower you should just stop offfering overnight and 2-3 day service, do you ever deliver a package in that time frame? Not to me you don’t we paid $165 for overnight and 4 days later your tracking says they will advise a delivery date as soon as possible, you blame bad weather and it’s sunny and beautiful on the whole route no excuse just terrible service
Never again"
"UPS local delivery does not advise you when will the package be delivered to your house. They just keep saying that the driver only has a personal phone and cannot call you. I missed their delivery twice due to no SMS, no email, and no phone call notice at all. The worst delivery service I ever had."
"Every single time I have order things using UPS the delivery date has been wrong. Even if you pay extra money for 1, 2 DAY DELIVERY! It will legit be ready to be out for delivery and then you wait all day and check back and said it was delayed and will be another 2 days. It's not worth shipping or buying anything with UPS. They are terrible."
"Wow. I can't believe the number of low ratings. I hate to join the chorus. UPS takes a lot of money and does not care what happens to your packages. If it was a one-time bad experience, I wouldn't write. This is the second time I've gotten unsatisfactory service and complete denial of accountability. Packages I sent UPS ground arrived 3 days early, which sounds great until you learn that the driver at his or her discretion left packages by the front door of the dormitory which was closed during Winter Break! Don't bother calling customer service; I made 3 calls and a couple DMs to find if you didn't require a signature and the package was delivered (i.e. out of their hands)
, they can't do anything about it except pick it up and send it back to you. That's assuming it wasn't taken by porch pirates after sitting outside all day. You pay a lot for their lack of accountability or common sense. In a college town, you'd think the hub would know the buildings are closed. Never again."
If I could put zero I would the fact that they left my package in the rain to get ruined and the man walked all around my yard while I wasn't home is insane customer service talked to the driver and called me a liar ups is a joke
"I’ve used many companies, but nothing as bad as this. The sent item was not picked up from the collection point for days and thus arrived late by a good week. Upon its return the sender missed one digit in the address. They delivered it to a nearby location which refused. Have they tried calling / contacting? No! It took me passing several useless bots and talking to two customer service operators (the first one said to have changed the address, but if fact did not) calls to get the address corrected. This was over 24 hrs ago and I still do not even have an estimated day for the delivery. The tracking is an absolute waste of time. Avoid UPS at all cost!"
2023 world of computers yet UPS cannot track nor can they deliver on time. Despite charging ridiculous fees and now they've combined with USPS so it sucks twice as bad stick with FedEx and pay the extra money
"I paid to ship a part to my techs overnight, with GUARANTEED delivery by 10:30 the next day (shipped Thur, Arrival to be Fri morning). Not only did the package not arrive on time, they didn't even deliver it until TUESDAY the next week. Trying to claim inclement weather, I live in the town it's shipping out of, and it was shipping 2 hours away, so I know the weather there. Then I spent 40 minutes on the phone, first customer service can't help you if you don't have an ""account"" number, I have a log in, there is ZERO account number attached to the order, or on my profile when I log in. She just keeps going on and on about how I have to have an account number to get a refund. They then transformed me to tech support to find my account number, he goes through all the steps and confirms that I have the correct tracking number and he can see my order and that I don't have a business account and puts me on hold while he ""checks the account and the tracking"" etc. Then he says he's going to transfer me to the refunds department so I can get a refund. He drops me into the AUTOMATED refund line, you enter the tracking number and it literally tells you this tracking number is not eligible for refund and our customer reps cannot give you one either. Then it just dumps you into the MAIN queue that you get when you call the 800 line. NICE GUARANTEED delivery!! We will NEVER EVER ship overnight or fast shipping with UPS again, all our business will go to Fed Ex. TERRIBLE customer service."
"Can't believe this company still survives. So many negative feedback i have never seen. One more from me - for loosing my customs documents, for not giving me a receipt, for bad customer service."
"Always correct and right in time.
Employees are more than great, polite and generous.
Recommended to my closest friends."
"I will never use UPS ever again. The customer service is based i Nigeria and they do nothing to try to provide you with information that is not already stated in the tracking info. BAD-BAD service. They claim on weather conditions, but we can all check the weather online, and the weather was FINE. 5 days in a row they stated a new exception notification with terrible excuses to why this has been delayed. If you try to email them they don't respond. What in the world is this company doing?"
"worst customer service in existence. impossible to reach a human. website is terrible, it feels like it was created by high school students, numerous bugs that make it impossible to manage shipments. clearly outsourced website design to save money. i don't understand how it's possible that a company this incompetent continues to operate. i seriously hope ups goes out of business and soon so that no retailers can use them."
They should have delivered my package by Jan 3 and it was written on their website. After Jan 3 they wrote that it’s not clear when it would be delivered. When they delivered the package they didn’t notify beforehand about it and called when they were near my apartment.
"To say that the service is unreliable is a massive understatement. On several days I waited for my package only to read in the tracking update that delivery was attempted but nobody was at home (even though I was there the whole time and nobody came).
I had to call countless times and listen to same promises that someone would call me back within an hour (they never did) and that my package would get here the following day. But the same thing kept happening. Finally when I was told that I would be called with the delivery date and time so that I wouldn't have to stay at home, and I actually went out on some errands, I got a notification that the parcel was delivered and signed for by ME!
so not only unreliable but liars as well."
"Lazy and incompetent.
The local (Show Low Az) UPS center has the lowest possible rating you can get on Google reviews and for good reason. The manager of this location is the least customer service oriented individual I've ever had the bad luck of experiencing. Customer service is non-existent at this location. Corporate is the same, worthless. They have intentionally made it impossible to get help from a human being. Bottom line, UPS doesn't care about anything but taking as much as possible from you and giving little to nothing back."
"I love having my packages sit in their facility for days before deciding to attempt deliveries. I love the awful tracking that never updates and then they give a 12 hour delivery window, guess I'll waste the day sitting by the window. I love how the drivers never knock and would rather leave a little IOU note than deliver a package.
UPS wasn't always steaming trash but these past few years have been the worst and it doesn't look like UPS will try to make it any better since they aren't bleeding money yet."
"Pay extra for fast shipping. Package goes out for delivery on time. Great!
NOPE! Package gets brought back to their distribution center and gets delayed due to ""weather"" (spoiler alert, it was a gorgeous day).
Ok fine, package will go out the next day, right? NOPE!
I guess they figure it's already late, why bother?"
"They make receiving packages absolutely impossible in Spain! I have tried repeatedly to make contact and given all the information I can - Ive created an account and updated online, rang customer support multiple times (their instructions did not work - whatever form they told me to fill in is not where they said it would be on the website), I've emailed with my information as instructed by support. Support can't even email me any information - apparently I need to fill in a form and email it which doesnt exist anywhere they tell me to find it, and they cannot email me it??? After weeks of waiting they have told me theyre sending my parcel back. Are they expecting me to confirm to receive the package by smoke signals and morse code??? AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"UPS is the WORST!! They can somehow never get to my address, which is absolutely ridiculous considering FedEx, Amazon, everyone and their mom can. And then they make YOU go pick it up at a far away location. WORST!!!!"
Just a waste of time can't deliver for no reason as I was in all day. Customer Service no use don't know anything. They need less than one star.
"Justin my driver said signature required for 16$ toilet paper,which Amazon did not require a signature...ipaid for a delivery to my home..which is 5$ extra ,his supervisor claimed he will leave it..but when I lived in 63132,ups left packages in an apartment complex gat required a signature..so when you in 63033 they discriminate...toilet paper and medicine..I never want to use ups again ,a million dollar company ...telling to get my shipping fee from merchant .."
"If I can choose zero stars I would do it.
Unreliable service, drivers with sticky fingers. They scan the package but never deliver it.
The worst experience ever."
"If there was a ZERO (0) I would choose the 0!!! Horrible overseas service but the same to the rest I guess. Cold blooded and rude customer service representatives. Customer service means nothing as a word and a as a practice to them and they simply don't care. Late parcel, and still we have to comply to their rules. No flexibility at all."
"Completely hopeless company to use for private shipping. Everything from delivery, customer service, website&app just suck."
"Hello, the truth is that I am very disappointed with the UPS service. I was waiting for a package yesterday which was not delivered. I called UPS last night. Karr answered me and they changed the address because it was wrong and they told me that they were going to deliver it today The package today calls me a supervisor and confirms my address and tells me that they will deliver it today, today when I look at the tracking it says delivered but I did not receive anything I call again and Vanesa answers and tells me that the package was delivered to incorrect address my question is why did they waste my time last night saying that they had already changed the address and today the supervisor confirming my address and today they deliver it anywhere The truth is a lack of respect, a waste of time and very little professionalism on the part of UPS. I need the merchandise and I don't have it due to UPS negligence"
Was in all day then got Email saying tried to deliver no one home will try next day it's now 3 days later still no delivery
They 3days late did pay R2500 for delivery but all they say is. This delivery address is in a remote area where deliveries are not made daily. 90km away like that money can cover a 90km delivery
"The package I was expecting was not delivered because no one was home, and it required a signature. I called customer service to have it held at the local UPS facility due to not knowing what time of day the next attempt would be made. I was told that there would be an extra charge. The extra charge is very close to 50% of the original shipping cost. This is a very underhanded way to increase revenue. It gives no choice if you want or need what has been shipped. I will no longer use UPS for shipping anything and will ask anyone shipping to me to please use another carrier."
F*** you UPS you guys f****** suck one day deliver it the next day you don't one day deliver it the next day you don't lazy f****** stupid f*****
"Drivers refuse to follow simple instruction noted on my account to leave packages at front door. Instead they leave them in the driveway to be stolen or rained on. 800 number has automated attendant that doesn't comprehend why I'm calling when I try to call them to fix it. It just sticks in a loop about a tracking number until it hangs up on me. If you make up a reason it likes you can eventually talk to a person to tell them what is wrong and they will tell you they are making some notes and then put you on hold and transfer you without warning to a different department that has nothing to do with the issue. I have spoken to the drivers directly with no change. FedEx, Amazon, DHL, and USPS all deliver to my front door as requested. The ""date of experience"" listed below should read 2019-2023!"
"Where can you start with these people?
Resetting passwords, incorrect emails etc etc etc
“We are experiencing issues at this time” seems to be their get out clause every single time.
Getting hold of them, including the ability to speak even reasonable English, negates any reason to use them. What an easy company to hate!"
Thoses clowns charge fees and duty and extra fees EACH time you use them.Every single time !!!!!! I hope you crooks go bankrupt!!!! 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I shipped a envelope on December 22nd for an overnight delivery and paid $63.00. Well my envelope never made it until December 27th 5 days later. I contacted UPS and was told they would not refund my money. DO NOT SHIP UPS they took my money and their service is the worst I have ever had. I will never use UPS again. They are the ones that screwed up not me. It was a $63.00 learning experience for sure.
"Claimed they couldn't deliver despite the fact that I was home all day. As I live at a dead end and overlook the only road from my window, I know for certain they never ran by my home."
You should change from ‘united parcel service’ to ‘united pakistan suckers’ as ur customer service sucks and all thanks to ur pakistani brainless advisers who barely speak any language. Wouldnt use ups if i would have a choice to avoid it any cost..they even blame rainy day that cousing them delays😀 whats a jerks
"By far THE WORST DELIVERY COMPANY EVER!!!! I sent a parcel to Portugal the 1st week of Dec to arrive there by Christmas as a gift. It didn't arrive because Portugal asked so many f**king questions about the gift. This was a beauty gift box brought from Sephora sold a 1 unit but UPS asked me to itemise every item in the box with a price!! Because this couldn't be done and I gave all the info I could the parcel is now on its way back. Only its not, its sitting in Portugal custom cleaning office for almost 2 weeks now!! The customer service experience has been the worst. I will never EVER use UPS again and I DON""T RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL!!!"
"I don’t think is all my 36 years I have ever had such awful customer service like I have with UPS. On three occasions they were supposed to leave my package and didn’t stating a signature was required when it wasn’t. When you call the local office in need of these packages they say they don’t have an answer or solution until the following day. In the meantime I paid for my packages to arrive on specific days and now I’m out the extra shipping and my package. On top of driving to the local “drop location” and being told it isn’t there. Again, customer service has zero answers and gives you an attitude. I would rather never order anything again than to go through this backwards, unfriendly and unhappy company. Customer service is helping not complicating the issue more!"
"Previous experience from 05/01/2023 was rated 3 star. Unfortunately my experience on 09/01/2023 was even worse. The tracking advised that the driver attempted delivery at 12:02pm. However, we have cctv cameras and the camera covering the barrier confirms that no UPS van turned up between 11:58am and 12:08pm. I was at home at the time. I phoned the service centre and was told that the manager at Stanford-le-Hope would call me, but no phone call. Not confident about tomorrow.....UPDATE: Delivery did take place the following day, at 7:10pm! With no time slot or live tracking I had waited in all day. Very frustrating! One star is too much."
I’m working from home today expecting à delivery from UPS. Delivery date is today. Good view out on the street. Now I just received a notifikation you can pick up your parcel 10 days+ from todays date because you where not home.
"The delivery service we usually receive from UPS is spot on.
But in the event something goes wrong - be prepared to tear your hair out.
Our customer/recipient contacted UPS on the 17th December to chase delivery of a parcel that was due on the 15th Dec.
He called them as tracking had been updated incorrectly.

Long story short - we are now on working day 14 of an 8 working day investigation and still have zero information on the status of our parcel. Despite calling the 'call centre' numerous times.
Call backs not delivered as promised.
No one from the 'investigation team' has contacted us as 'the sender' to see if we have any information that may help them locate the item?
Crazy!

The 'call centre' seem like robots reading from a script when all you want is someone to care, help and try and resolve the situation.

NEVER have I received such poor customer service - we paid nearly £400 for this shipment which gives you an indication of the size of the item.
PARCELS DON'T JUST VANISH!
And if it has - time to own it!!"
"Lmao the opening line on where you right your review states What Went Wrong This Time. Man you would think some stupid a## would maybe read these reviews and think Gee something is not right,needless to say UPS you have gone down the crapper you are actually worse than the worthless Postal Service least they try to fix a problem you morons just make excuses. Here's a good idea maybe stop hiring thieves and looks to be drug addicts specially during your busy times 🤬"
I have never seen a company more irresponsible and disorganized than them. They returned my package 2 times because they claimed that my address is incorrect!! And after 9 times emailing to their support they said they don’t even know where my package is.
"So I'm told my package would be delivered by Friday January 6 by 9pm. Great the party this package is a gift for is Sunday. Didn't show Friday. Email says Saturday the 7th by 9pm. Ok i can deal with that. Nope. No package Saturday. Then Sunday the 8th by 9pm. No. No package. Now it's Wednesday the 11th. Ummm how can that be when it was out for delivery on Friday? This company is ridiculous and should not be dealing in customer service. To afraid to drive to a rural area and actually work is the problem. Stop using covid as an excuse, its over and after 2 years of it you should have it figured out. I paid shipping and it's not being shipped or delivered. Now what? You're in the customer service game and you've failed miserably!!!!"
"I gave you a star just because it allows me to write a review.
WORSE SERVICE EVER!!! Charged for a pick up request and pack was not picked up, never received a pickup request number but I was charged for it instantly, how a claim cannot go forward if one doesn’t have the pickup request number? Should be possible with the tracking number to find the case and solve the problem, but customer service is terrible, if you don’t have what they request they simply answer you with the same question, SUPER RUDE!!!"
"UPS have no idea of customer Service. They were very happy to take my money ask me questions about explosives and batteries. Asked me to open my packaging which was bubble wrapped and double boxed, along with foam to protect the knobs of an expensive musical digital item, take the shipping costs and additional costs for insurance, but then when they throw the item around refuse to pay insurance. What made it worse I sent 20 other items via Australia post without any issues. I've now had to borrow money at xmas due to the issues with this terrible company. They have no care. Surely the officer who quizzed and checked my packaging should have had more care if there was an issue with packaging but being double boxed bubble wrapping etc. I can't believe the box was damaged in multiple places and the metal rack ear was so bent. Very upset :)"
The contact from the company during the buying and shipping process was fantastic. The drysuit underliner really shocked me. For the price it well exceeded my expectations. Great quality. Great experience.
"Store7578 is new to our area and it has been amazing to use.
In early December we had to send 6 boxes from my granddaughters dorm as she was leaving to go home.
Every box was received in perfect condition!
Every time I go there the service is exceptional."
"Received an email stating I could collect from ups collection point 2 miles away. They claimed to have tried to deliver. I was in all day. I then received a email stating the first time my parcel would be delivered would be the next day.

Confused. They certainly are. They do not attempt delivery and just drop parcels off at a generic collection point. This is not the service I paid for."
I have a UPS account and never encountered such poor customer service as I did this week! WOW! UPS failed several times to pick up packages that were ready. Driver was confused about address with apartment number blamed them for not giving him the information. What!? I live in Brooklyn it's a three family home and the apartment was provided. There are three bells labeled and we are the only Martinez family. Why was UPS confused? It's illogical because again I have a UPS account. We scheduled pick ups online all the time....never had this issue until now. I'm not sure if maybe the driver is inexperienced or the customer service agent. Horrible experience this week. Hopefully my packages will be picked up on Monday 1/9/23.
"TERRIBLE. I LOST A PACKAGE BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO RETURN IT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I asked them to change my delivery date to another day later, and it seems that since the package was already on its way, this change wasn't approved by THEM without me being aware of this. So instead of letting me know that it wasn't possible, they decided to RETURN IT. And yet, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO SOLVE IT. I'm utterly disappointed with their customer service and management. There's no such thing as a company that doesn't care for its customers and does the worse work possible. Miscommunication is all you'll receive from them, plus getting your package lost. Good luck if you already did the mistake of trusting them and arrived at this website because of the same/similar issue. Do like me and from now on let's start reading reviews from delivery companies in advance."
"UPS is a joke out of Omaha, 3rd time they rerouted my packages by mistake and sent them to Sioux Falls sd. When I called they said because of weather delays. Where it was going great weather, Sioux Falls was having a blizzard. They can't even admit they screwed up."
I would give a minus if I could. Absolute numpty company. They will lure you in with a good rate to send your package but the delays are horrendous. You cannot get through to a clear English speaking representative which can be even more frustrating. I was told 5th Jan that my item would be released from Customs and delivered on 6th Jan......No its still held in Customs. Trying to get a clear answer as to why is impossible. I would have been better off using Royal Mail......and they're striking!!!!! UPS NOT A PREMIUM COURIER COMPANY AS ONCE WAS!!!!!
This is the second time my package stated it was delivered at my door and it wasn’t! They kept saying they notified dispatch and they will give me a call but then stated we don’t know if they will call!!! UPS IS A TERRIBLE SERVICE AND PURE LAZY!! DROPPING PACKAGES OFF WHEREVER THEY PLEASE!!!
"Waste of money, time and resources. Delivery services are not windows, just guesstimates.
Drivers now pull up in shady looking vans. Packages are always damaged. Packages are ALWAYS late.
Ordered a laptop with 2 day shipping. It's now on day 7, and it's 2 hours away from my city and my delivery estimate is the 10th. UPS representative told me I couldn't pick up my package in person, that's for customers who pay for our premium services.
No resolution. Not even a sorry. Company needs to be investigated. This is fraud to lie to customers about the service you charge and refuse any resolution. Attitude of customer service is ""be happy with what you got"".
Someone get the BBB involved please."
"For the 2nd time in the month UPS driver did not bother to deliver package to my place. Instead of delivering UPS sent me email saying that I wasn't available and I need to pick up my parcel at UPS facility. I was at home all day, so that means only one thing: UPS driver did do his job....another example of laziness and lacking of professionalism. My complaints to UPS about this issues didn't go anywhere. They didn't even follow-up my complaints."
When are things ever going to improve? It's been years of the same complaints and you guys still do not improve anything. You keep delivering every single package to an access location even though we're home. No matter how many times we ask you to stop doing this or complain nothing is fixed. When we call in it's really hard to get a hold of anybody and when you do they're from another country. It's hard to get them to understand your issue and they don't help you with it. All they care about is a tracking number and finding that package they don't care about any issues you may have with the package or fixing those issues. The drivers have problems with delivering packages and they won't look into it or improve. I'm so tired of this company I do everything I cannot to use UPS. It's ridiculous that some addresses they will just automatically take your package to an access point for no reason.
"Normally UPS uses their own drivers and vans to deliver. this time it was obviously outsourced and as a result the updates on arrival date were confusing. First I was told it was to be delivered on 3/1, then it was changed to 4/1 and finally it arrived on 3/1 - luckily I was in to receive it. And the driver got lost, I had to talk him in over a 5 minute period on the phone. And the van said 'Diploog' not UPS !
Disappointing as UPS are very reliable."
"I received notification that the parcel would arrive on Fri 6th Jan. I then received notification that it would arrive Thurs 5th Jan. I contacted UPS immediately to reinstate the later date as I was out all of Thursday and did not want this expensive item left on my doorstep. Hey-ho, arrived home at 1900hrs to find my parcel had been delivered, despite my message to them. It was raining lightly, but fortunately the Persian rug was contained in plastic sheeting so it wasn't damaged. This could otherwise have been an expensive claim against UPS."
"First they can get people who want to actually work, And people who don't lie about delivering a package and especially when that one lie could cost the recipient of said package her lights, food,and possibly her home so thats all I will say"
"Ofcourse they do. not only drivers they do but whole system does. 19th Dec 2022 i was waiting all the day at our office for a 200$ stereo bought from ebay. did not arrived till 6PM. i locked the doors and left. 3 hours later, the tracking showed it delivered 7:21PM! , after 6 all of our doors are locked and no any possibility for any delivery. we checked our cameras , no one from UPS did not delivered anything that day. there is F*** 1800 742 5877, this is the only customer support , its a robotic that make to make customers phsycio! when you enter tracking number it said it delivered and go to website to openning a claim. i did, it said UPS is searching for the package, days days, …. 100s times i called , you can not talk to any one!, i emailed 3 times, no one did not respond. i went to two of the huge warehouse in Fremont and Sunnyvale Ca. the security did not know anything and they don’t help at all. likley they programmed to make any customers phsycio. there is a door named customer support but always is closed, but i noticed a UPS employee is there after 3 PM! , finally after 15 days i reach to some one in UPS! the guy checked the compter , first said computer showing found it! then he looked and said no! its not here! we talk near 5 min, he was so angry of the UPS managment aparently and said they are firing most of us. they don’t have budget! sorry but we can not help you! forget it! or work to get money from ebay! wow, i noticed something! he said the item is from ebay and you may get money from them! that means if the items are stealing, its good for us! , out side of the building a UPS driver was seat on his own car, i asked him, he said not me not any body can not help you! i said: hey, what if a driver steal a package! imagine! a driver is clicking on its tablet , Delivered! and there is no cameras on his car or most buildings! who want to sue him?! the driver got so mad and said load i want you to leave here! . this was 3th times in 2022 our packages lost. this is not just problem of this company, all big companies are cheating customers some how that for them is billions $$$ saving yearly, i have enough documents from Paypal, Ebay, Apple, Chase, Ford, #UPScheatingcustomers"
If I could give zero stars I would😡the company needs to train the employees pn better package handling. Yall choose this job so if you dont want to fo it them quit cause nobody need their packages tore the hell up when shipping.
All I ever had with UPS in the UK are terrible experiences. I was notified today by email about change of delivery date and was asked to sign up for the new date on UPS website. Everything I did to try and sign failed. No customer support.
"I am very disappointed with this courier. I have ordered from Zara and H&M last month and both my ordered I got notifications they were delivered but never receive them. They don’t even give you information of what address it was deliver, it just says “delivered - to the city and state”. The one for H&M at that time I was literally outside cleaning when it says it was delivered, but no UPS courier came to my house.

It is very inconvenient for me. As a customer who paid for the order and even paid extra to get it on time but never receive it. Took forever to get refund as well, because they want to investigate about it before they give me a refund which does not make sense to me because I paid for the items I ordered paid extra for the shipping to get it on time and it was courier they used who messed up, so why should I have to wait for them to finish the investigation to get my refund back."
"DO NOT USE UPS! I sent a high value electrical item worth £2,300, weighed about 15kg, I spent £50 on packaging materials to make sure it was protected, and I paid £70+ for UPS to deliver.

They damaged it so badly they sent photos to the receiver who refused to accept the item, they then arranged the item to be sent back to me, charged me multiple times for re delivery that I didn’t ask for, then I get an email saying they have lost my item.

After a month of chasing up the lost item and speaking to call takers from all different countries who had terrible English speaking skills (and I mean it was really terrible I’m normally fine with peoples accents) I received a phone call stating they have found the item and they sent through photos, the photos I couldn’t believe, it looked like they had driven over the box several times then wrapped it up in black plastic wrap.

Now the item cannot be used or fixed, the company who makes the item can’t fix it, I only had it for 2 months, and UPS will only compensate me £500 plus delivery fee!

I am honestly shocked that they operate like this and I wish I had seen these reviews first, NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I EVER USE UPS!"
"My parcel had status ""We are trying to get the security access our driver needs for this delivery. "" but they didn't explain what this meant and no one tried to contact me. My parcel was just lying in their warehouse many days!"
"UPS need to improve their internal communication between the courier and the customer service.
I have received an email saying that i will receive my package around 09AM -11AM. Been waiting till 14:00 PM but after checking my email it says that the package will be scheduled for another day as at 13:05 I was not at home😤. I called the customer service to complain about this matter, she said that less than 60 minutes they will calling me again to solve the problems but I never received it. Very bad services😠."
Left a rug worth 900 euro outside my front door .rug could have been Robbed ..instead of taken it back and trying agian the next day ..pure luck it was nt taken
"I hate UPS they slack off their work
I ordered a cellular tablet thru my wireless provider and they chose to ship it thru these dumbassy people and it was in their delivery truck and was undelivered without reason and I waited at home all day tracking information became unavailable without reason for days to finally get a update that they were coming to deliver my cellular tablet and did this time and all in one piece and was relieved to receive it and was worried sick beforehand not knowing what was going on and hearing they steal from some of their customers I will NEVER use UPS AGAIN!!! and I wouldn't recommend them for shipping anything valuable"
"I will never deal with this shipping service again! I was expecting 2 packages that were returned back to sender because of supposedly refused delivery, and I never spoke to anybody nor had any type of contact with any UPS mail carrier! When I called UPS customer service, all they could do was apologize & say it was a “mistake”. They were not very knowledgeable in my opinion and kept giving me ‘standard’ answers just to pacify me."
"Driver did not leave an info notice on door when trying to deliver package that needed signature (I was not home), yet UPS website does not allow you to change delivery time or location (unless you pay minimum of $10) online. Finally got a hold of customer service agent (India?) who could've cared less about a customer not being able to access information about a package in their own account. Agent suggested that I have it sent to a pickup location and pay $7 to do so. Unfreakinbelievable how this company, which used to be the pinnacle of success, has fallen so low. Doesn't even try any more."
"Terrible experience. They lost the tracking, then they gave me a wrong info notice number, then they lost my package!"
"Now I know why no one uses UPS anymore. They take FOREVER to deliver a package and then blame it on USPS, etc. Shame on them!"
"Sent a parcel through ebay. UPS lost my package, wouldnt pay insurance, as they said I did not supply adequate proof of value. Surely, the value is the amount the ebay buyer pays? Seem to be a scam company."
"UPS is the worst company on the planet. Literally every interaction I've ever had with UPS has turned into a nightmare. Every. Single. One.

It would take serious effort to be this bad at operating a business. You could make a comedy movie about a terribly run courier business and you wouldn't even have to exaggerate, just copy exactly what UPS does and there's your movie.

I will never use UPS again and if I order something online that's being shipped by UPS, I will be cancelling the order to avoid any further interaction with them."
"Wow!!! What a horrible experience dealing with UPS Customer Service. No one can answer questions, no one can guide you, and the website is even worst! Depending on the UPS Store, the service can range from bad to horrible. NEVER USE UPS for shipping anything you care for."
My package was returned to me after the UPS driver couldn't deliver it to the right address twice. I was charged over $60 on the whole order. The whole process took over two weeks and my package was returned to me looking like it had been kick dropped off a cliff and then soaked in water for 3 days. Don't use UPS. Complete dog water of a company.
Absolutely shocking company. Said they tried to deliver my parcel 3 times but no one ever came. The day they did arrive I wasn’t home and they told a family member they would try tomorrow but then put it as a refused deliver meaning they didn't have to bother with the parcel anymore and sent it straight back to the sender. When contacting them they were no help and told me it wasn’t their problem. Would never buy anything from a company that uses them for delivery. Couldn’t be more furious
"So here's how UPS works. Not for the customer but for themselves. An example. I ordered a custom item and the merchant told me it would be delivered in 14 days so that's what they told UPS. But, as it turns out the item was produced the same day and shipping label created same day. It was ready to be shipped immediately. In comes UPS, they see the 14 day promise and leave the package sitting there because they know they don't have to pick it up. This package is 1 state away and it will take 2 weeks thanks to UPS self serving policies. Horrible delivery company."
They were supposed to pick up returns and left the return labels outside on a table and then canceled my pick up. I then spent the next morning dealing with ups on the phone I was not satisfied with the outcome of their service they did apologize but that didn’t solve the problem
"Terrible company, showing out for delivery several days then nothing 7 days later"
"Outrageous international shipping and customs duty charges. UPS charged me 278,000 Naira to ship and clear a phone from Maryland US to Abuja Nigeria. They claim outrageous duty charges on your parcel despite having brokerage deals with the Nigeria customs. Worst shipping company ever! That’s my first and definitely the last experience with UPS, will never use or recommend to anyone"
Absolutely awful service with the not clear procedure to receive in Turkey and not clear how to get it back to the sender in the EU!
"Absolute crap, avoid. EVERY time (no exaggeration) I have had a delivery from UPS here in Norway they just say that I am not at home when they have «tried to deliver», and then send the parcel to a delivery point far away. Meanwhile I have been home the entire time, and no one rings the door bell or even tries to call me. Amazed that UPS continues to let them use their brand name, because it is being dragged through the dirt. This has become such a talking point in my friend group (I am not the only one with this experience) that we now avoid all online stores that use UPS."
"Two to five days my ass. My grandma deliver faster than UPS, false advertisement. I paid almost 200 dollars for the shipping fee only for my package to get delayed again and again. It's been over a week or two now, where is my package! Bruh DHL cost LESS than yall and they deliver fast!!!"
"A bought some electronics supplies from Newark, which got shipped out via UPS. UPS decided to deliver a day early, but not give me an email notification, so I missed the delivery driver. On the UPS site it said they would attempt delivery the next business day, business days went by and no UPS. The driver didn’t leave an “InfoNotice” either, so I couldn’t arrange a pickup or anything like that. I tried emailing and that didn’t work because I didn’t have an info notice. I called the 1800 number for customer service and got an automated voice asking for a tracking number… it couldn’t understand what I was saying. I called back and asked the voice to speak with a representative. It finally understood. I got a representative who I could barely hear and with a major language barrier. She basically told me, from what I could understand, that my package is lost and she has no more information than the website (?). She took my email address, which I had to spell out, and still must have got it wrong, because I did not receive an email. So now I have no package, no InfoNotice, and no way of getting any help or customer service, and it’s costing me time, frustration and money. UPS is a JOKE. Avoid at all costs.
Id love for someone to reach out to me from the company, however. I have some great ideas on how to improve your business."
Package sent to the warehouse indicating nobody is at home eventhough we are home the whole day and they didn’t even bother delivering anything.
I paid extra for next day delivery 24th December only for the item to be delivered 4 days later!
"Ups messed up the address and then tried to blame me lol
Shame on them typical don’t accept responsibility for your mistakes blame the customer
Have issues with them EVERY time. It’s always something
Poor service period"
"Worst delivery service in the Universe! I have not received my package and it says it has been delivered. It also says it is pending acceptance, so UPS cannot even seem to agree on the status of my package.

I tried to call and speak to customer care but they don't have a customer care number, everything is automated. It is a big shame that a company as big/important as UPS have no way of speaking to a customer care agent.

The automated service says I should file a claim online, I tried to file a claim but I cant even login to my UPS account because it says my password is wrong. I tried to change my password but the website keeps saying 'error occurred'.

This is the worst experience ive ever had with a delivery company, big shame!"
"If I could, I’d give UPS and QVC a negative 10!! Both companies are liars, and cheaters"
Just posted a pick up at local depot note - no attempt made to deliver parcel. Stayed in to receive heard the note through door got to it and opened door to see truck pull away. Joke of a service. Effecting businesses who use them as I will avoid if I know UPS do delivery
"UPS has flagged my account for requiring signatures when 100% of the time that the senders do not require signatures! Management at the local distribution center advised it is because I live in a 'bad' neighborhood! Amazing considering that none of my neighbors have this done to them requiring them to sign 100% of the no signature required packages!
It is useless trying to contact corporate as no one ever responds. The customer service phone number is also a great waste of time because you need to navigate through their phone menu in order to get anywhere and most of the time, the system just hangs up on you. On the few occassions I was able to get through and speak with a live agent, they were all kind eneough to take my information and pass it on but no one has responded - ever!!! And this is after trying for several years, more than 4 years!!!
Joe Farrell, VP of Customer Experience, has not responded just completely ignored my direct Emails to him. Actions speak much louder than words regardless of how many customer surveys you send out and so far, UPS has done NOTHING!!!"
"Horrible customer service, they never clal you back? Have tried for weeks to resolve an issue. It affects my company and customers. I will changen to DHL"
"Worst experience from any company in my entire life.

Incompetent staff that can’t even write down an email, I must of read it out 10+ times.

Telling them a 18 digit ups tracking number with letters in it was almost comical. Perhaps employ people who speak English or atkeast can understand a bit.

Voicemails they leave that you have zero chance of understanding what they say.

Biggest joke is I paid extra for ups express delivery to arrive in time for Xmas still not got it now and no idea if it will ever arrive?

Been messed about with delivery dates several times waiting in just to have it move last minute to the next day.

As long as I live I will never use UPS ever again! Not even if they paid me ."
"For the 2nd time in 3 months, UPS has delivered my package to the wrong town (South Portland) which has a different zip code than where I live (Portland). Additionally, my street does not even exist in South Portland. So how the hell can they claim the package was delivered.

There is no one at UPS to call. There is no help online or on the phone. The automated responses all say ""I can't direct you to an agent"" regardless of how much info you give them."
"I received a package on my front porch, I am disabled I cannot get to it but I do know that it is not my package (Could see the Address/ not my address) it was somebody else's shipped to us by accident... I tried calling customer service after a freaking 45 minutes of the automated trying to talk to a live agent, I finally got one and when I did I could not understand this person for the life of me, all I kept hearing was tracking number, tracking number, tracking number, tracking number, they weren't listening to me as I was trying to explain... you need to correct this, I don't know if someone will come pick it up or if I have to get someone to drop it off (I am disabled)...
I would rate this with zero stars but it does not do zero..."
UPS performance during the holidays was pathetic and their tracking updates were silent for over a week. While I understand that holiday volumes can overwhelm unprepared carriers it is both predictable and manageable. They often cite weather as the reason for delays and again winter weather is predictable and manageable in most developed countries. Overall UPS performance makes them one of the least desirable carriers and I definitely do not recommend them.
Literally worst customer service ever. They have lost 2 packages that I have sent to customers and are making it impossible to get reimbursed for them although multiple claims have been filed and paperwork for lost package. Ive has 30 calls with them and keep getting the runaround. They have abruptly hung up and also provided conflicting information among their own representatives. Their package insurance is total BS.
Delivery was to be to door but the delivery man didn’t even remove from his truck. Had to carry very heavy rug across the street and upstairs. I’m 75 years old.
"Expected a delivery for Christmas, 1Z698W756815698286, but delay after delay after delay by my-pictures.co.uk and UPS means no present and still no delivery.

Claim filled with paypal. Please avoid UPS."
"I sent a package to my brother, an old , sick person who doesn’t drive and depends on a daily help for living. The package was supposed to be delivered on12/29/22.but it wasn’t,and two attempts to go to a co office was futile.
I called customer service and I was assured that the package would be delivered to his home address on12/30/22, but it wasn’t.
I called early on 12/31/22 asking what happened to the package and the answer was “well, it’s the holiday weekend, it will be delivered on Tuesday 1/3/22”. The first time I called the excuse was that the drivers are seasonal and the package went to a center instead to the address I sent it, and today was the holiday!
Congratulations UPS, my rating for you is -1……0"
Good trustable in time. But don't like you forcing me to arrive to 8 character
Very poor experience from UPS UK. I was expecting a parcel on the 29th December and it did not arrived. There is no way of contacting anyone. Tried to log into UPS account to redirect or track the parcel but no joy as it automatically defaults to USA address. They try attempted to deliver my parcel a day later without any communication or update and I was out. I finally contacted their customer service and they promised someone would call me with an hour. Still waiting.. very stressful experience. Not sure when the parcel would arrive.
"First of all, the driver didn't even go to my apartment to deliver the package. He said he attempted to deliver at 2:38 when I have video proof that he didn't go. Then I call CS and she tried to charge me money so it could be delivered today. After I told her that if wasn't my fault, she said that it was going to be free of charge and that she was going to put it again in route. If the driver didn't have time, it was going to be sent to the ups pick up area. The driver didn't even attempted to deliver and sent the package to the distribution center. I called again CS and the guy said I didn't tell them I needed the package for today. So it was my fault. I thought it didn't matter if I said it or not, their job is to deliver the package the day that they say it's going to be delivered. Lazy driver and awful service."
"Horrible service. The UPS person didn't even attempt to deliver the package and left a note. Then when we called the customer service, the representative yelled at us. Worst service!!"
"The worst. The fact that I had to follow the advice of a Reddit user to get a person on the phone regarding a missing package containing my controlled substance medication: appalling. not to mention them shelving it off to a third party delivery driver who showed up unannounced and never delivered the item, is that even legal?? We’re talking about controlled substances here. Tip: if your medication gets handled by UPS for some bizarre reason and your package never came: give an incorrect tracking number to the bot. Only a digit off from the real tracking number. Keep doing that and saying no it’s not correct and it will eventually route you to a person. God Speed."
Avoid like the plague !! Worst delivery company of all. Customer service useless. Delivery man don’t even knock or bell. I think they don’t even stop by your place. Can’t have better word than : stay away from this company.
"Would have given zero stars if i couldve. Customer service is no help, there absolutely useless n infuriating. They do not stand by there guarantees. Ive been waiting over three weeks for so.ething that should take a week. Then if you call its nothing but ine exceuse after the other. Save your time n money. Do not use!!!!"
UPS Driver keeps throwing package across fence. I request all packages to be put on front porch. Laying the yard like that if not home is a way for someone to come in my yard and grab package. F+++++++ is my7 rating on UPS for delivery.
"Absolutely awful. Consistently fail to deliver my packages, leave delivery slips, late at night, on the opposite side of the mailboxes of my building so I never see them, then have the audacity to charge me an $8 fee to hold my package so I can do their stinking job for them. And the worst part is that there's no recourse. They obviously don't care, filing a complaint is like arguing with a wall, and nothing will get fixed. Complete and utter incompetence."
We are disabled. On 12/22/22 a ups driver delivered medical supplies dialysis fluid 7 boxes to my house. He did not bring to door or attempt to knock or notify us of delivery. We did not no items had been shipped. On Thursday the 22nd temperature was -4° we found the boxes on the 23rd scattered at the base of our steps blocking access to our home and frozen solid useless. Several attempts to have UPS remove them were ignored. It's been 8 days and 10 phone calls boxes are still there.
"Dire! Delivery made a day early so I was out. Rescheduled date sent by email for 3 days later but they tried to deliver the following day and I was out! Impossible to speak to anyone by phone so for my third - and last attempt- have requested it is delivered to pick up point 3 miles away and I don’t drive! Absolutely appalling. If I could leave -5* it would still not reflect my experience this with company,"
"Man it's a nightmare. ""we're delivering your parcel when you're out"". To solve? Create an account, a profile, a whatever but a massive faff with a 58 character password and email verification just so I can say ""I'll be out, come tomorrow"". Guess what, they can't come tomorrow but they can come in 3 days. When I'm out. Leave with a neighbour? Nope. Leave in a safe place? Nope. Leave at my risk? Nope. Bloody UPS. I'll check who's the carrier next time I buy something and if it's useless parcel service, I'll buy elsewhere. Oh PS, all of this faff involves a million email notifications I don't need.

Software & processes written by people who don't have the misfortune to need to use them. Crap. How many clicks? UPS = millions."
"UPS is the shipping service that I had the least number of problems with. Granted they are slow sometimes, but their estimations are mostly accurate. At least they don't lie saying resident not available without even attempting to deliver like FedEx do. I don't mind waiting for a package for a week instead of being lied to about fake delivery attempts."
We have been waiting for a cellphone we purchased through T-Mobile for several months. Since UPS does call the phone has been returned twice. UPS does not have the intelligence to call us up so the we can obtain the phone. This is not the first time have had to deal with this ridiculousness. I wish there were better service carriers for this area.
Worst worst s company ever!!! Worst humans ever! Do not use!!!!!!
"would give zero if there was such a score. My box was delivered while it was raining and left in my driveway where it could have been stolen, came home and the box was saturated with the rain water, this is poor service provided by the UPS driver"
"Can't even decide where you want the packages sent to. UPS seem to decide for you based on where it is hardest for you to collect your package and send it there.
Give me an option to redirect the packages to specific pick up points and for goodness sake, deploy or rent some package pick-up locker space instead of forcing interaction with random kiosks and obscure locations who don't care about the packages anyway.

Also, don't claim to accept only a QR/bar code to send a package with your service and then have the kiosk employee claim it requires a paper label. It seems you have no control over your pick up points and how they treat your customers."
"Worst delivery service.
You can’t communicate with them. They ask for a phone number but never call you for delivery option.
Also the worst customer service in Greece. Very disappointed."
Delivery took 10 days instead if the promised 2 to 4 days
"I had a horrible experience and One star is not what i like to give but 0,I sent my parcel and expected to receive it on the 16th, today it is the 30th and nothing ,I keep calling and nothing is resolved , terrible service never used again . In the Uk I had no problems with the service, this all happen in Spain , the spanish service is horrible"
Useless company been trying to contact them about custom clearance rang 4 times over 4 days respond to txt messages that where sent to me no phone calls back no txts back i would not and will not ever use them for sending anything.
"This is the fourth time I had medicine/injectable medication delivered to the wrong address from UPS that needs to be refrigerated and it’s made in a lab and cost thousands of dollars. Once I showed up at my doctors office to get my shot, and it was never delivered and then when we tracked it they delivered it to the wrong address so I couldn’t get my injection. Two other times my medication was lost, which is time sensitive, and today it was delivered to a completely different address and street over four blocks from my house. Really horrifying!"
"I called UPS to point out that I rec'd an Invoice on December 29th......Dated Dec. 6th and due on December 20th. I wanted to ask about the late charges for payment as noted in the invoice since I didn't even receive the invoice until AFTER the stated Due Date, and I also had some questions regarding the charges that were detailed in the invloice. The girl told me that the charges related to Canada Customs and I would have to contact them, and when I questioned her further she just hung up on me! I was a little taken aback until I remembered that the company I was dealing with (UPS) is one the the worst companies I have ever dealt with in my entire life!"
So I'm a local rep for Amsoil. I used UPS for shipping normally would take 3 days it takes 3 days with every other shipping company. And it's been two weeks and my customers still doesn't have his parcel. I called you PS and they say it's weather related I say for 2 weeks really every other parcel that got delivered by every other shipping company made it there within 3 days. Either way they give me every excuse under the book as to why this partial is not delivered avoid UPS at all costs
Service until it gets to my rural home is great. Problem is with the driver who after many requests continues to leave parcels 100 ft from my porch.
"If i could give YOU-PS less than 1 star i would. This service is, in the most fitting context, a scam, and I cant stress enough, HOT GARBAGE!!! I paid for ups 2nd day air for a delivery. 5 days after getting no response to emails and tracking showing ""label created"", I contacted the seller. I had confirmation that the package was dropped off to ups. It turns out that the incompetent company lost the package
($350 value). The seller apologized (zero contact/response from ups), resent using 2 day air again and refunded me my shipping costs. It has now been 7 days and the delivery date just changed from today to tomorrow... I will NEVER use these morons again. I would pay the value of what I ordered JUST to have my packages arrive when I'm told they will arrive. The poorest customer service I've ever dealt with."
"UPS SUCKS!!!
USE FEDEX!!!! This company SUCKS!!!
I’ve had to call on 3 separate times, every time , even though I’ve scheduled a date and time, they come when they want! DISGUSTING!!! To no avail! Then they want to charge for their incompetence. I truly don’t understand why bother calling and making arrangements when they do what they want!"
"Just shocking, drivers give you 3 seconds to answer the door before running away, dreadful"
"the worst delivery service in the world. They lie, lie and lie every time you call them, they change the delivery date every day, never order anything with this company, you will make the worst mistake and you will be stressed for days."
"UPS lost my iphone 14 max pro. I am very sure the UPS staff stole it. It was in processing, and suddenly the tracking is unavailable. That is a a Christmas gift.

UPS is not the first time to lose my package, and they are never on time. I now completely avoid UPS. I even use USPS, not UPS.

UPS is definitely the worst. I just can't believe APPLE, SAMSUNG and some other big companies keep using UPS.

Our company ships 40-50 express mails out daily, and never ever use UPS. Even customer sends us UPS waybill or prepaid UPS packs, We just don't use them.

I wish I could give a negative point for UPS"
"Worst customer service
Worst worker"
"This company attempted delivery to my home on three consecutive days, whilst I was away in Budapest. They emailed me and I responded with the fact that I had been away. They were trying to collect duty charges. I sent six emails and they never responded to any. They then sent a letter to which I responded with payment in order to get me goods. I am now told by the provider of the goods that they are on the way back? I am a big fan of Vivienne Westwood who uses this courier I will now not order from them anymore to avoid any contact with this courier."
"flipping worse than useless, they either lie or as thick as mince by not understanding the delivery address. Package from Lenovo bounced around Glasgow according to the tracking and never attempted to come out to Argyll.... instead they send package back to sender without being requested to. We also sent them our correct address to verify, but its like talking to a brick wall......... AVOID !"
Horrible service delivered my package to the wrong address I recommend nobody deal with UPS they hire anybody service is unacceptable doesn't even deserve 1 star
Dear UPS you are the worst company on fu****** earth. I been waiting for my kids packages for 2 weeks now. I been awaiting packages for 2weeks 🙄🙄. At this point I could pick up my own sh** from your damn warehouse
Package was supposed to arrive a week ago and every day when I track it it says it will arrive by the end of that day then at the end of the day it says delivery will be determined at a later time. Sick of this delivery company
"If you mrfkrs are not going to learn how to provide a valid tracking number, you can actually track something or won’t get the actual person who can help people your sh¥tt¥ a$$ company is doomed. They don’t even ship themselves, the do it through USPS or FedEx. What’s even a point of them?
Let this wish of all of the customers who ever dealt with you come true. Amen 🫶🏻"
UPS is a scam and should be made to pay for the damages cost to their customers. My girlfriend paid 200dollars for priority mail and am yet to receive my package. I regret ever using patronizing ups.
"An awful experience
Nightmare experience sending international parcel. Made over 10 phone calls and followed instructions but still had parcels returned. After starting the process again and send parcelsd again after many setback, phone calls emails the parcels went. This took over one month even though I was told it will only take five days . This was not a result of any strikes. After paying all charges for shipment and custom charges I noticed that 3 extra payments were taken from my card for over £120. This was without my knowledge. I contacted the company and asked what this was about I was told I have to email them. No one were able to explan why the extra charges. I was told that it will take up to 42 days for them to respond. I contacted my cards compay and was told that UPS set up a monthly plan of over £120. Bear in mind that I paid all charges and also custom duties therefore I owe nothing. I only knew of this when I saw the payments taken from my account. I will never use ths company again. I am still awaiting them to credit my card with the money they took from my card without my knowledge and without my approval."
"I ordered Christmas gifts to be here in time for Christmas and it's now December 28 and no gifts. I track the packages and I see the statement ""Awaiting package acceptance"" at the receiving facility. That's the same message that's been there for 5 days now. How long does it take to scan a couple of packages?"
"For the second year running a very small parcel, marked clearly gifts and entered online as gifts, tea, chocolate orange and ceramic table mat. All under £12 and clearly entered. Delivered on time but a few days later my friend received a bill for import tax. That is bad enough but the tax applied is nearly the same as the value of the presents. I will never use UPS again! And for the second year running I will be fighting this payment. I know we have obeyed the rules as my husband spends his days sending things around the world. It took 9 months for UPS to reply last time and they admitted there was no tax to pay. But their ignorant staff is costing them their reputation which is zero in this household. So they will also lose ALL commercial business too."
"The UPS in Tuchomerice Czech Republic is the worst service ever experienced.
Despite the label contains the right address and the mobile number, the parcels are always blocked for days/weeks with the reason “unknown address” and nobody tries to be in contact.
I had several parcels and always the same situation.
The customer service doesn’t help as they are in another country and cannot do much, when I’ve been in contact with them they just acknowledge that the address is correct and a new delivery would be attempted.
It is impossible to contact the driver and they don’t leave any “info notice” at the address so it is also impossible to modify in the UPS website the delivery or to go organize a pick up of the parcel."
"UPS U SUCK !!!!!!!!!!
INCOMPETENT INCOMPETENT INCOMPETENT INCOMPETENT"
"Ups picked up package nov 21, still stuck where? who the heck knows, amazing you are still in business, I get packages from all over the world, no issues only when the vendor uses ups for delivery. First thing I do know to see who does their deliveries if it’s ups shipping sorry, no sale for vendor. Ups tracking never updates tracking, just like never getting your shipment"
Ups is a joke they will leave a very expensive item at ur door no signature but always when it's something minor small not that much they want signatures and instead of taking things to access point they reattemp instead of making a definite drop off like people need their stuff then you arrange for a pick up at local facility they tell you expect a phone call within an hour 3 hours go by u call back they tell you same thing now 5 hours go by call back they tell you their closed get outta here mad as hell wasted my whole evening this is so disrespectful on so many levels
"Liars. Unprofessional. Joke. Kristina and miss Kawa? I can't remember, miss k. You are both trash and the worst human beings on earth, I have proof, if that package gets opened and stolen or the gift wrapping and tags come off, after my ""wonderful customer service experience.""($86? Usd because I had to call 4 times, because you both purposely made me hold, and purposely disconnected me?) Screenshotted that, too. Should be sitting in your email
I am in FL. My best friend is in mityana, there is an 8 hour time difference I will be back to write more. I've never been treated like that in my life. By ANYONE! Documented everything. Please don't lie anymore, I used to work for ups, I was so kind, and you guys were playing on the phone. No empathy, no dignity, no professionalism. I want to know how you both got hired? Anyway, if that package gets opened and this gets ruined and you guys steal, I'll be very aware, ok? Call Kris from customs in Germany. He cleared packages and I have confirmation that he uploaded all information into system. Yall need to call him, check your email kristina. I left 26 files of evidence. Thank you ❤️ You called the RECIPIENT for customs Info? And told HIM I am rude????!?!?!?!?!?!? DUDE, I was as kind as I could be. YOU ARE RUDE and disrespectful. I was not. Is that a recorded line please? 🌈
You know you don't do that, right? And told him I was rude!?!?!?!?!?! Lol. Yall are rude. AF. That package doesn't move from safe and secure until corporate ups FINALLY decides to help me. We are trying to run a charity, and frankly, you're both human trash. Thanks for your 5 hours of ""help"" today. Do not contact reciever again. Until you are delivering it to his home. That's the only time you are supposed to contact reciever, If you have a hard time locating him. Original ups guarantee, Dec 22. It's almost January and 9pm where I live (past business hours) I saw what yall did this morning. I would rate you lower, but I can't. You are both liars and I didn't expect this experience in Uganda. The guy from customs, who cleared me, in Germany, uploaded everything into system. ""No more problems"" you wouldn't even take both tracking numbers, I swear to god you guys were mean and rude and unhelpful AF. I AM WATCHING THAT PACKAGE LIKE 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 please figure it out. I've sent everything everyone needs to every dept. Including you. That package stays safe and secure until corporate gets involved. Thanks for absolutely nothing, ruining all of our holidays, draining my bank account, keeping me awake from 1 am (9am over there when you open) and you guys wasted my time for hours and CONTACTED RECIPIENT for CUSTOMS INFO? How would he know. They are presents. For a charity. Email me corporate, I am busy, and disgusted, and paid and shipped on Dec 8th. You both should be terminated. And pay me back $86 usd for hanging up on me on purpose, x4. not giving any info I ask for, not already having our tracking numbers in your system. Liars. Caught in every single one. The scans say it all ladies. Don't open those boxes. Kawa. 🌈 👀👀👀👀👀👀🎄"
Pathetic at best! and they know it.
"I experience worse service they didn't deliver my stuff they lost it, when I made complain they are making different type of excuse of staff delivered I lost 129$ including shipping, I will never send anything with UPS."
"This review is for the UPS store on 2nd Avenue in St. Petersburg, FL. It seems that customers have a poor experience across the country with UPS, but this may be the lowest performer of them all, so if you are in St. Pete, go to another option. Mike, who runs the place, has adjectives that would describe him, but not fit for a review. UPS creates SCAMS under the aegis of ""Acts of God"" when they don't deliver on time. We paid close to 300.00 to overnight a package to MS and it never made it. Claimed due to weather. Maybe. We get that. They should refund the difference between normal delivery and overnight--otherwise they are scamming customers for money for a service they didn't deliver--regardless of the excuse--and taking the money for not doing what they said is simply FRAUDULENT. So, Mike, I hope you sleep well knowing that you are a dishonest, uncaring, scrooge. For the rest of you, all I can say is steer clear of UPS on 2nd avenue in St. Petersburg, FL. I wish trust pilot had a star for scam and fraud--a unique category that Mike has proudly attained."
The driver won’t drive down my driveway and now I am late getting my package… ups does this fedex always comes down my driveway even USPS will go down my drive way I have had it this is the third time I am done with up. Can’t rely on them.
"Wish I could write a review with a lower star!!! Worse experience ever with a delivery company. Lost my package of Christmas gifts to KS in MISSISSIPPI of all places. Spent 2+ hours being sent from one ""department"" to another. Asked to speak to a supervisor. Apparently UPS doesn't have any. Asked to speak to a complaint dept. UPS doesn't have one. I remember my parents making over how great it was to use UPS when I was a kid. They have deteriorated since then and are an EPIC FAIL. No use using them anymore."
If I could give - stars I would. Stole my Christmas gifts then lied and said they did not have anything inside. Called local store and got run around. Manager is an a$$. Sore #3063 Sunil Pathak. Will never use again.
"I ordered an Item for a present. Had a text from UPS to say my parcel will be delivered that day I stayed in all day. When I went out at tea time I found at the bottom of the stairs to my flat a UPS form saying sorry we missed pick up your parcel at the drop shop. So I had to make a special journey to the top of Bath to collect my parcel which was not delivered properly no body rang the entry door bell which worked, I checked or a knock on the door to say they were there with my parcel and paying eight pound + for delivery I should have a refund and not use this parcel delivery service if they can't do the job properly. THANK you"
I asked them to hold my package for pickup because I was going on a trip. I arrived and was already sent out on the delivery truck.
I dont know why anyone still uses UPS. I still have packages that are over a week late that haven't shown up. The tracking website just says The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible for the last 3 days.
"Made a mistake in my adress, corrected it, parcel still goes back to sender, false information from service staff."
I pay for express but the package delivered after 3 weeks. What shame!
"After going through several transfers not getting any help with an item they say was delivered but was not.
They say they left a package, no they didn't I was here all day and night. I call for any help or customer service and they repeatedly tell me I'm lying and the package was delivered. It was not delivered, ever! I ask for a supervisor then in the snottiest voice ever she says the supervisor won't do anything then proceeded to transfer me to another Customer, yes another Customer. There were actually three of us that got transferred to each other all with the same issue, says delivered but they never did deliver anything. Again I call back and Melissa refuses to give me a supervisor instead comes back and says they can get back to you in like half an hour so I said I'd wait. Ten minutes later the same person comes.back and says we have opened an investigation but the refund would be issued to the seller if they decide they can't find the package they say was delivered.
So to sum it up UPS will steal your stuff and tell you to deal with it along with not refunding any money to the purchaser.
No wonder they're rating is horrible
Do not do any business with them they will steal your stuff and your money!"
Didn’t arrive and no notice of any duty payment except a letter - sim disappointed no wetsuit for Christmas
"No accountability; no ability to talk to customer service to assist when next day air package with keys not delivered for 4 days! 12/19/22: Our daughter and I travel to Stowe VT for a vacation and stayed at the Stowe Mountain Resort. I flew and she drove from Washington DC.
The last day there 12/22/22 - she couldn’t find her car fob to drive home. She slept on the floor of her brother’s AirBnB in Duxbury VT as Stowe Resort was sold out. 12/23/22: Her friend sent keys UPS next day air at 9:25am from DC UPS store at cost of $129.00. Guaranteed delivery to the Airbnb in Duxbury VT by 3pm on 12/24/22.
12/24/22: Package didn’t arrive and she got notification that arrival was tbd. 12/25/22: I call UPS customer service as Key is still not delivered. Agent says no information will be available until 12/27. I talk with supervisor - 45 mins later finally learn package was delivered from DC UPS location to MD location but did not move out of MD. She doesn’t know why. No further information is available until 12/27/22.
I explain that our 26 year old daughter-with limited credit card and funds - has no place to stay and no car in Northern Vermont. Her keys were guaranteed to be delivered 12/24/22 by 3pm when she would drive back to DC. UPS (according to CS supervisor in what appears to be a call center outside the US): can't help. The UPS CS supervisor says there are NO options to assist. No way to get information on key delivery prior to 12/27;
No way to get her place to stay; No way to get her rental car; No one at UPS that I can talk to
12/26: At this point she has spent hundreds of dollars on meals and Uber rides. She was alone for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. She is supposed to be at work today and doesn’t even know when her keys - guaranteed by UPS to be delivered 12/24 by 3pm-will arrive."
Claimed delivery. Claimed they 'Met with customer' No such event occurred. Then they lied about it when I contacted 'customer service' they said to speak to the shipper. When all the time they delivered the product to the wrong person at the wrong address.
"Terrible to extremely Terrible
They say they will deliver
Change the date
And then 2 days after say they can't deliver for 3 day
Unbelievable with no recourse
Will demand that my delivery use fed x"
"Usually I love UPS for prompt and efficient service. That's why I gave 3 stars. They really got super lazy this time, and I believe it's just the driver. We had a huge ice storm so I get my package being delayed by a day. However. The roads were clear, and mostly clear in my neighborhood, as the mail and FedEx was able to get through, yet UPS stated they ""attempted delivery"". No they didn't. There were no cars in the driveway and it's a 20ft walk to the porch. This was a Christmas present for my daughter. I called to see if I could get to the hub and wait for the truck to return to get my package and was told they would be closed, yet trucks were still running at that time..."
They sent a message say my 1day shipping was delayed due to weather and then said it won't come until the 27th then sent a message hours later saying it'll be here Xmas Eve no show up then I call and they say it's in Kentucky bad weather skipped Florida sad never use this company for nothing if I can help it they need to be bought out by FedEx sorry ass workers no update or nothing at all
I bought a computer for my wife for Christmas from Best Buy and was told that it would be delivered 12/24/22 before Christmas . I received a notice from UPS that the Package arrived at their facility in Chipley Florida 20 minutes from my home at 1:30 am December 24th and they sent me a notice that it will not be delivered until December 28th 2022 . So its going to sit in their warehouse 4 days and ruins my wife's Christmas . It was the only thing I could afford . Now she will have nothing to open Christmas morning in front of family and friends because a multi million dollar company called UPS would not deliver it . They have no care about their fellow man . I talked to a representative called Denise and she did not care i ask to talk to her supervisor and was told her name was Jade not only did she not care about my dilemma that she actually hung up on me . The rudest supervisor UPS has . Thank you UPS for ruining our Christmas . I will get insomuch with the local TV stations to see if they will publish this report . I will also go to all my social media accounts and ask all my contacts to repost this review . How do I upload my delivery date published from BestBuy that UPS did not honor ?
"I tried to ship a small package to EU using their application. They charged my credit card and I dropped a package. Then they catch up to unprorer lithium battery label and it turned out there is no need for label, than they said they need commertial invose with my taxID (SSN) SSN for $100 dollar gift package. You are kidding! Why you didn't say it sooner before I paid for shipment?"
I have a parcel at Bristol depot still awaiting delivery. I only get apologies and rescheduled dates once I complain to my supplier. Even then you fail to deliver it. If you cant cope with the workload you shouldnt take it on. Late deliveries should also mean refunds are due. I now know what UPS stands for. Useless Parcel Service. Yes other companies have issues but Id have thought UPS would have been better than that hence the grade
"Delay after delay after delay, though the customer service team promised me my package would arrive. Had multiple bad experiences with UPS, so not use this shipping service."
"Package delayed over a week
A Christmas present that will now be late
UPS SUQS!!!"
"Still have not received? Tracking informs it has been posted to my town somewhere and left ""other"". Can't find it"
Normally I don't have a problem with UPS. BUT TODAY DRIVER STUCK A NOTE ON MY DOOR NO NOCKIN OR RING THE BELL..BEEN CALLING COSTUMER SERVICE AND THEY BEEN GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND I AM LIKE IF YOU CAN'T COME BACK SAY THAT.I JUST WASTED A WHOLE DAY AT HOME FOR NOITHIN LIKE 3CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY AND U COULDN'T NOCK OR RING THE BELL
"UPS Website and login really stinks, seems like every time I go to login it states my username and password are not correct but I have them written down!
They need to hire some knowledgeable IT person to revamp their login process. Even when you try to change the password it just goes back to login. ITS A VICIOUS CYCLE. This isn’t the first time, it’s one of the worse sites ever, they need to go talk to Amazon or borrow their IT people."
UPS was supposed to deliverd my consigmemt on 22/dec/2022. Now they are saying due to mechanical issue the packet will not delivered. They have the worst system. I would recommed never use UPS for further.
"I wish I could give no stars. They are the worst. Driver made one attempt. They didn't ring the bell or knock. For the next 4 days straight I was told my package would be delivered by 8pm the the next day. Then, they said delivery made another delivery attempt, which was false. I was home waiting and watching until 8 pm. No knocking,no notice nothing. They are terrible"
"If I could leave -5 stars I would. Calling for customer service is a joke. There automated system sends you around in circles, never allows you to speak to an actual person and then hangs up on you. I can see why there are so many bad reviews."
"The tracking system is the worst ever experienced. We were going to be out on the advised delivery slot. Web site says that we could change it. Spent hours trying to log onto their system. Got nowhere. Tried their phone system, went through all the recorded bits; answered all of the questions, three times, each time it just read out another recorded message directing us back to the web site. Tried their online virtual agent system, just as useless as the others."
"They said package would be delivered in the evening, they tried to deliver it early in the morning when I couldnt receive it, and then delayed the package to next week. I expect better of you when I pay for the express delivery. On the leaflet they left it states that delivery will be attempted 3 times in a single day, they have not attempted more than once."
"So dissatisfying company. So disappointed!
Our parcel was not delivered even though the address was full.
There was no notification about the delivery, no sticker on the door. We have found that our parcel was returned to a sender by a coincidence. Of course UPS doesn’t care.
I hope that there will be no need to use this company ever again."
I had a great experience. Today I was at the Colerain store at UPS and Tamica was very helpful and thoughtful. I was in line for less than two minutes and I was very pleased with the service that I got from Tamica today.
They left not one but two very expensive packages at the wrong house
Told us the driveway was inaccessible because of snow. There was one inch of slush. We needed that package today.
"Do not use the worse company ever .. its the 4 time deliveries didn’t come .
I ordered meat for Christmas the company use ups … and it didn’t come"
Corrupt company. Any online purchase from a store that uses UPS will get their package back. This way I can impact UPS fake delivery.
I received a paper mail envelope it was already raining and the driver put it out in the opening on a table and it was wet and I have a patio covering at the back door order number62556087-001 requestor beckygutierrez customer number00490043332150000
"No way to get a human being on phone for help. They keep leaving my packages at house in front of me, usually I go get them myself but just went through medical procedure so I cannot. It is almost Christmas and 3 orders left there, can not get in touch with anyone to have driver go get packages and bring them to me. Why do they keep leaving my packages at the wrong address, my address is on the packages. Will not use UPS any more, I will go to stores if not available to ship with Fed Ex."
"Every time I see UPS as the carrier, I know I will encounter major problems. So, too many issues to address. This Christmas season is the worst. I have three separate orders now just riding around taking a tour for the past two days. Tracking has claimed ""out for delivery"". Email, ghosted. Finally connected with my local hub where packages were loaded. Rude, inconsiderate and no help at all. Can't even locate THREE packages that are suppose to be on a truck for delivery?"
"If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. UPS needs to be held accountable for its abysmal customer service. I have spent two days searching for a package and have been told five different times to go to an address, only to arrive and be told it was somewhere else. I have wasted fuel and time. The 800 number is useless. Clearly UPS does not care about customer service or about customers at all. I will never use UPS again… At least there is FedEx"
They have had my parcel for about 3 weeks have used various excuses as to why it hasn’t been delivered and as a result Christmas for my son will be ruined as they won’t admit the parcel has been lost or stolen so the company I purchased item from won’t refund. Never ever use this company they are either thieves or plain useless.
"Terrible company to deal with. They asked me to pay customs by mistake and now I had to call 4 times to get the error corrected, on my own expenses. I had to deal with rude customer service and I was redirected countless times between different departments until I was redirected to collection. I'm still waiting for the refund of a credit note received almost a month ago.
not to mention that the transport + customs + brokerage was 40 euros and the value of the goods payed was only 40 euro."
"Dreadful, Dreadful service. DO NOT USE.

Spent a lot of money on an 'express service' - package has been returned to us twice as UPS put an incorrect label on it when yhey collected it. They are incapable of sorting it out. Customer service of overseas , they have no idea of what is going on and are impossible to understand or communicate with.

Spent hours on the phone trying to sort out. Only now to have to go through the whole explanation process directly with the accounts department, again overseas, to get a refund. Never again."
"Says delivered three of my packages by a side door. I don’t have a side door. When I attempt to call customer service, the recording hangs up on me. I finally figured out how to bypass the recording and speak to a per. They promised someone would contact me about my packages. I told them that I have cameras that show my packages were never delivered. I said that their driver is lying, and I want to file criminal charges. They don’t care, and they still won’t return my calls. Unfortunately, there is another package that is supposed to be delivered next week. I’m sure I’ll never see it either."
"UPS has terrible service! UPS has in the past made three attempts to deliver before holding at the local distribution center for 7 days for pickup.
They attempted to deliver my recent purchase only two times, both in early afternoon when no one was home and then returned the package to sender. This new UPS policy is totally unacceptable!"
I could have drove 26 miles south of my place to get my packages because these passes got a couple snow flakes on there truck what s bunch of bull sh t UPS really does suck!!!
"The workers at this company steal your package(s). They sign for it as well and run off with your package. Customer service is no help either. You have to call several times just to resolve your issue.

There must be away that UPS can screen their workers or add more camera around the delivery vehicle to prevent theft. There are too may scenarios of people not receiving their goods.

Another thing is, the delivery people purposely don't knock hard at your door for you to hear that they are attempting to deliver. You end up missing your delivery due to their spiteful behavior. I've personally experienced this. If I can avoid delivery through UPS I will. Amazon seem to be a far better distribution company, heck, even the Post Office is far better at getting your item to you without theft involved."
"My package was 30 miles from me and was suppose to be delivered the next day and it didn’t make it, and said it was delayed! How can you delay a package that was setting 30 miles from you the day before and the next day it’s marked as delayed? Very unhappy with ups!"
Your investigation police is rediculice for express and the fact that your not willing to deal with the customer only the shipper is stupid.
"Just like Canada post, UPS is a joke. These people don't deserve a pay raise. Their useless. ""Attempted Delivery"" Im home you know, no knock no call. Ya, okay. I have more orders coming and I just set it for pick up at their location, because their useless and will never be able to learn how to put in numbers in a buzzer. ""We didnt know the buzz number"" Umm did you even attempt to put my apt number in? Or did you just stare at it like a dumbass? My god. Do your job. Useless."
UPS drivers constantly leave packages in front of my garage presuming that I am never home. This could not be further from correct as I end up almost backing over my package when I let my garage door up to exit because I don't see the package directly in back of my car. How difficult can it be to place the package at the front door oh I'm sorry it's 10 steps . Really this has happened more than I care to mention and I just can't understand why someone would be so lazy as to risk damage to a customer's package in this way. Leave the package on the steps if you're too lazy to walk up to the door.
"UPS sucks. Go with literally anyone else. They returned my Christmas gift to my boyfriend literally days before Christmas for no f-ing reason. Its states away now and will not make it back in time. I have nothing to give him now on the actual day. Ive lived on customer support this whole week and it , of course, did absolutley nothing but waste my time"
"Scheduled a pickup for a return which came when I was not home so they left a return label for me to take it to the ups facility myself. I went to the UPS store in Florence Al because it was a large box I needed help with it. When I told the lady that I needed help getting it out of my truck.. there was a big sigh and she questioned, ""how BIG is it?!"" The only helpful person in the store was the young man who was apparently new because the 3 ladies there kept chastising him for helping me tape the box and yelling at both him and myself that I had to buy a roll of tape. Then an Asian lady came out and started yelling at the young man for taping my package and yanked the tape out of his hand. After being made to feel I was a huge imposition and making everyone mad, I told them the that i was sorry if I had upset them, but only reason I came in there was because I needed help with the package and that I thought that was what the store was for.. service. Apparently not.

The young man there needs a raise.. or a better job. He is much too good to be working at that store. I hope I never have to go there again."
"you sign up for delivery updates but never receive them
they say it's out for delivery 4 days in a row but only attempt on the 4th day. I never thought Hermes/evri could be beaten as the worst but congratulations UPS you have managed it."
What a joke I ordered a package on the 9th which was due to be delivered on the 11th they rescheduled about 4 times and then delivered it to an amazon warehouse no idea why had to ring retailer up so sent me another via ups only for them to reschedule again this was a Christmas gift ordered in good time that will not get here these are costing retailers money due to the poor service
Been waiting for a delivery for 3 days despite promises that were made to me last week. I have had to call multiple times and no one getting in touch with me to explain the situation. I have no idea what the status is. Someone at a depot said they would call me back but I'm not hopeful. I'll be avoiding these guys in the future.
Package was supposed to be delivered on dec 16. Still have not received it 5 days later. Been sitting in a warehouse 1 1/2 hours away for the last 3 days. Definitely will not do business with any company using them for delivery
"Very rarely get deliveries from U.P.S on line tracking will not give an update about delivery was told when I phoned at the weekend it would be delivered Monday found a note in the door saying parcel taken to a shop. I never heard the bell and havent been out for over 2 years I'm now trying to get it delivered to my address ,site says will update but nothing .Top marks for a live person at the end of their phone line but still no information so that's useless. I won't want them delivering anything else to me as their communication is poor other companies give great tracking even EVRI are now providing time slots and others give information on how many stops away they are allowing you to keep a look out for them .29th December only getting back to this review to update after the last contact with their customer service department and being assured parcel would be delivered to my home but would receive a call back from someone later in the day about the delivery waited and waited so went on to their site where a message to me read collect your parcel from the shop you have two days, so now will not order from any company using UPS ."
"Absolutely dreadful service.
Zero transparency, zero costumer service, zero care, never ever use this useless delivery company as you will regret it with your pocket and time."
My original birth certificate from my baby book. My original marriage license from my wedding book. A savings bond from my deceased family photos. Old family photos. UPS lost them all. I’m devastated. There are no words. Use a sender that you TRUST if you care about what you’re mailing.
"My parcel has not been delivered for 3 months!
I'm asking here but no one is helping!
ups customer service is not worth five cents!!!
1Z34F37V0391977855"
Driver claimed to have tried to drop off package and I wasn’t home. I was sitting at computer in front window and never saw a truck at all. And there never was a note left by them as they have to do. Proof I am not crazy or lying. This happened three days in a row and package got sent back to sender when there was never actually a real attempt to deliver. Drivers are horrible and lying. Customer Service showed no concerns what so ever. Told me to call sender and make arrangements to deliver again. Will never get in time for Christmas. They are frauds.
I have a package that's supposed to be delivered through ups. I have to sign for the package and everyday I have been waiting for the package from 9am-9pm. No one has delivered the package but everytime I track the package it's saying delivery attempted and that they will try again the next business day. I have a chair I sit in that I can see my whole porch very clear. I have a ring camera and not one ups driver has attempted to deliver my package. Checked my ring camera's and there's no ups driver in site. So they are being lazy and lying saying that they attempted to deliver when they really didn't. I absolutely hate ups. The whole company from the driver's to corporate is very unprofessional and trifling.
why are they not keeping track of what goes where and before the holidays !!!
"The new driver delivering to zip code 83833 on the east side of lake Couer D’ Alene Idaho is terrible!
Too lazy to walk halfway down the driveway, he leaves packages besidethe address post on the highway. Good luck finding them if the snowplow goes by!
All previous drivers have delivered to my doorstep. This has been going on since October.
This guy SUCKS!!!"
"They can not ever deliver the package to the right address, we moved 8 months ago and changed all our addresses on all our account’s and they still deliver our packages to old address. We have contacted them several times about this but it seems to waste our time talking with them. Would be nice if they went out of business"
they continue to send my parcel to the wrong address. i called customer service and theres nothing they can do. completely trash company.
"UPS is the worst. They tried to deliver a package and I was gone for the Christmas holiday already visiting family. When I asked if they could postpone it to the near year, they said it was $12 per package.. and my package was split into 5 parcels.. So, they had me pay $60 to postpone a package. I am super unhappy with this cash grab system UPS has set up."
Worst shipping company to deal with. There website is so confusing and leads you in circles or doesn’t work at all.
"Instead of putting my packages on the side of the door where the knob is so that I could reach them, or even see them easily when I opened the door, the girl put them on the opposite side, 5 feet over, hiding them between my shed and my tall flower pots. I didn't even notice them until hours later because they sent me at text at 3:30 pm, as I was leaving, saying that my packages were delivered at 12:30 pm. If I hadn't gotten the text at that moment I would have not seen the packages there til probably the next morning. I wish I could upload a picture here. If they put them where I could see them and get to them easily they would have to walk another 5 ft. This has happened MANY times. People just don't seem to care about being helpful or doing a good job at something"
Very long waiting time for customer service. The number to call for the returns is a French number although the delivery happened in another EU country. The number for the rest of the customer service is a regular number...
"Package is six weeks late, coming from Expressions catalog. Mailed on November 4, promise to arrive by UPS by 9 o’clock on December 19. Didn’t arrive, now promised December 20 by 9. Call the company and the item I purchased is now on back order, no faith that delivery will happen today. So that Christmas present is off the list. Same thing happened with Shutterfly order. Finally ask Shutterfly to print another book and mail it out which thankfully they did."
No idea where my package is. says “given to customer boys” what boy? Where? No evidence of delivery and no contact number. I’ve had other companies where you can actually call someone at a depo who contacted the driver and ask what happened within 30 mins. There is no contact number anywhere for UPS and even worse their chat function is a robot with 5 lines. AWFUL. Would never use a company that uses UPS again. Lost a £120 parcel 3 days before Christmas with no idea if I will ever talk to anyone to resolve. Shockingly bad. They need to seriously improve there customer contact services
Absolutely useless!!! Paid for next day delivery as my item was a live fish.....now theres a delay!!! The fish may not be alive when it gets here due to useless ups!!!!!! Fuming to say the very least!!!
WORST company ever I wouldn't even give 1 star if there was a minus star the rate I would give is that .... so here goes I work nights have sat up all day they said my parcel would be here by 2pm it never arrived I have sat by the window waiting but no show then had a text to say the had tried to deliver it NOT A CHANCE IN HELL 🤬 so my husband has rang UPS up only to be told its gone to a pick up point so he goes and guess what it's NOT THERE ANGRY IS A UNDERSTATEMENT we have payed for next day delivery and still yet to receive my parcel why any company's use this sh** company I do not know
Left note saying sorry miss you but never said why driver refused to leave packages as easy could slid under my door and was told could pick it up and was told they call me but never did as had to keep calling to find out and they act like you are bothering them and still no one call me
UPS was supposed to deliver my package on Thursday. I didn’t receive it until Monday. They said that tried to deliver it on Friday but no one was available. That is a lie I was there until 7. I Don’t know how you stay in business with customer service that your company has. Please do better next time.
"This is now the third parcel that I've had problems with from UPS this year; enough is enough. They tangle the customs process into a knots every time; in a way that DHL and Fedex just do not. I've been waiting over 3 weeks now for an ""Express"" parcel, with no indication of delivery date.

I will no longer shop from retailers who use UPS. I'll ask every time, and shop elsewhere if they can't offer an alternative courier."
"Sent a small package from Italy to UK, supposed to take Five days. Took 15 days. I would strongly advise against using UPS"
"I had a package to be delivered. The appartment I live in, is just build like two months ago. UPS has trouble finding it. That is ok. I don't mind helping them out finding it. It tried to phone them but they have this automated phone operator with a lot of options you have to remember and choose from. You finally get to the department you are looking for, they have a voice entry for the tracking number. The system is not able to understand what you are saying. I tried it like 5 times and then I hangup on them. This feels to me like it is a discourage tactic to contact them."
"UPS, NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE AND SHOULD HAVE THEIR LICENCE REVOKED
MY ITEM WAS NEVER ATTEMPTED TO BE DELIVERED!!
BUT WENT TO A PARCEL COLLECTION SHOP MILES AWAY, SO NOW I HAVE TO CATCH 2 BUSSES TO GET TO THE COLLECTION FACILITY. I PAID FOR DELIVERY TO MY PROPERTY, BUT INSTEAD OF THE DELIVERY DRIVERS HAVING TO SPEND HOURS DELIVERING PARCELS TO PEOPLES HOUSES , THIS CRAFTY COMPANY HAS THOUGHT HANG ON WE CAN SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR BY DUMPING THEM OFF ALL IN 1 GO , AT PARCEL SHOPS
1 DELIVERY SAVE FUEL COSTS , CUT DOWN ON DRIVERS TIME ON THE ROAD, AND FORGET ABOUT THE CUSTOMER!!!!
I HAVE HAD AN AUTOMATED STOCK REPLY FROM UPS IMMEDIATELY AFTER POSTING REVIEWS SAYING THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THINGS.
WHICH LEADS ME TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE SOMEONE EMPLOYED TO TRY AND BULLS_ _T THE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME TO FALL FOR THESE SCANDALOUS SHORTCOMINGS FROM A COMPANY
THAT LACKS PROFESSIONALISM !!!!
HEADS SHOULD ROLL , AND BOSSES SACKED,
AND BE PAID ON RESULTS FROM CUSTOMER SURVEYS
THIS IS A TRUE EXPERIENCE FROM ME, AND THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPEND THIS YEAR, OUT OF THE ONLY 2 DEALINGS I HAVE HAD,WITH THEM, SO THIS SHOWS IT IS NOT A ONE OFF OCCURRENCE. THANK YOU ALAN FAREY
I AWAIT ANOTHER (LAME DUCK) EXCUSE FROM THEM..."
"Delivery to wrong address, called them 7 times to change it, still note change. Tracking not shows real location. Customer service is a joke."
Hauled azz after work to get to the UPS access point to pick up a package. The clerk at the counter told me he couldn’t scan the ticket after 630-even though no one else was in the store and it was open until 7 PM. It was 635. Both of us were there and my package was there but I could not receive it because of some ridiculous rule.A waste of energy and I still don’t have my package. Attempted to call customer service and that was an even bigger joke. You’re dealing with robots
"The first attempt to deliver my package was a fail. First off, I live in an apartment, it clearly stated that on the package. The apartment complex has a locker area for deliveries which I’m signed up. My package required a signature, so the UPS driver didn’t bother going to the apartment instead went to the locker area and left a “we missed” post. Of course you did! I called UPS and made sure they knew to go to my apartment instead of locker room since NO ONE is in the locker room. 2nd attempt- I get an email stating my delivery will be delivered around 1:30-5:30pm. My son found a note outside on our door at 1:10pm stating we “missed” you again. According to automated line, 2nd attempt was made at 12:30pm. But my soon went out at 1pm and the post it wasn’t on door, came back 10 min later and found the note. So now I have to pay to pick up my package at one of their locations. And it’s not about paying the extra fee but about the principle of it all. If the driver knows signature is needed at time of delivery why go to a locker room to begin with. I use Amazon all the time and have never had any issues with them. Some of the drivers will even deliver the package to my door, which they are not required to do. Never had any issues with my packages until now, with UPS. Such a shame since I used too think highly of their services."
"I see all these bad reviews and I’m like, “why are you being rude to a them?!” They are trying to get packages to you guys, but things happen, for example, I had a package coming in the mail, it came a week later than first figured because of weather. I’m just glad that the driver is safe! The roads suck at the moment, so thank you. I hope you and your families have a great holiday weekend! :)"
"This review is for UPS Spain. I would give them negative stars if I could. They allowed me to create the order online, pay and print my labels, ship my parcels only to find out one month later that the parcels were being held at Spanish border control because they were missing some info on the documentation (which was not flagged as mandatory when I was filling in the documentation). They did not notify me anything was wrong during all this time...nothing! After I started enquiring given that the recipients were not receiving their goods UPS told me what the issue was but would not allow me to rectify it any longer and told me the goods were going to be returned to me (I am still to see if they can manage that at least)...and that's that. No apology for their mess, no nothing. Rubbish service, stay away!"
"UPS does not care whatsoever. Continues to delay package drop off. Has left note twice on a package the could have left on my porch. Did not give me an option to have them leave it on my porch. Came by when I was at home, did not knock and left note. Then charge a ""convenience fee"" when I offer to just pick it up at their store to do their job for them. Would use any other shipping service provider."
"I recently received a package from Amazon, delivered by UPS. The package had a hugh dent in the side. This happens a lot and is not actually the issue. Someone had opened the package, tore open the package on the inside exposing the contents. The contents were there, but it was obvious a UPS employee opened my package, the box actually containing the item, then not liking what I ordered, taped it back up. This was a domestic package, no customs involvement."
"They say customer first in their slogan yet they have by far the worst customer service out of any delivery company. They have made up “brokerage fees” to scam you out of money and do not let people know they can self-release packages without having to pay this made up charge. No other delivery service charges this and only charges import/duties as is to be expected. When this issue was brought up, they told me they would refund the brokerage charge and it would be processed within 3 days. After receiving no refund I sent numerous emails to which they chose to not reply to. They told me I’d get a refund, and then ran and hid expecting me to just let it go. This is a slimy business that will grease you out of any extra money they can. Avoid at all costs!"
Worst service imaginable. Specified a day of delivery and they throw a fragile package 1.2m x 1.2m over a 3 metre security gate on a completely different day. There was no signature confirming delivery because no one was here to receive it. This package was left on a day with bad weather warnings for torrential rain. You can imagine the state I found my artwork package in. They also overcharged on customs duties by 300%
"Extremely disappointed by UPS performance, or rather non-performance. Paid a premium for next day delivery for a time critical parcel; dropped off the parcel the same day and was picked up by UPS the following morning, but then they didn't deliver for 4 more days. Would not pay any compensation because they claim I delivered the parcel later than the cut-off time which was about an hour after I paid for the service. Nowhere was this made clear on paying for the service."
"There was duty to pay on our item. We paid for an express delivery as we needed the item urgently!
The driver just posted an invoice for duty through the door, didn’t knock or ring the bell. He just wrote on the invoice please call office or pay on line. I managed to get to him before he drove off and he just said pay the invoice and sort with the office.
I called to pay invoice and told them I needed the item sent back to me today.
After nearly 2 hrs on phone, various promises of a call back, various lies by the off shore call centre I finally got a call back from the actual UK depot I ended up having to go to a drop off point to collect my parcel.
Drivers don’t care, call centre lie and the overall service was terrible!
I would say the one star is for the actual manager of the call centre who did keep to her word and got the depot to call me!
The driver should have waited for me to pay! I wasn’t given this option"
"My first time using UPS, sadly my $443 package is lost 😥"
"Never informed me the package was coming early. Checked the tracking and it had been delivered at 5:16pm at my door step. Package was gone. Stolen I presume. It's the holidays and they know about thefts, they didn't bother to ring my bell or knock on my door. To let me know it was there, what's crazy is I was home."
"My package was to be delivered on a Friday. It shows it hit the local courier for delivery. By end of the day I checked the status again and it said enroute to Kansas City, which is 5 hours away. 2 days goes by and it still says enroute to Kc. What the actual hell? Now no delivery date just "" on its way"". It's now an expensive lost Christmas gift. UPS is the worst."
"Several times UPS has delivered my packages to the wrong home, right number, wrong street. And sometimes I have received that neighbors packages at my house. This happens only with UPS. Good thing this neighbor and I have gotten to know each other."
"This is worster delivery service,thay can make you spending your time whole week!!!! Never use them!"
"UPS doesn't deserve even a one star. Their service altogether is absolutely horrendous! And it's nearly impossible to get to a ""live"" agent. UPS lost my package in transit and I can't even file a claim. When I finally reached a ""live"" agent, I was transferred to another agent who informed me that since the package contained a trade-in phone to Verizon, that only Verizon can file a claim. I hope Verizon leadership doesn't renew any contracts with UPS and uses FedEx instead."
"I had ordered some product, and the vendor worked with ups. I put in my home address. When, a week after the estimated delivery went to check via tracking number, I saw that they had left my package in a nearby collection point. Mind that I never received a mail or text with delivery times notification. I created an account as advised so I could arrange delivery, but then there was no option to actually do that."
"Package was out for delivery on a Friday before a “Required security check” delayed the delivery. Now am unable to even pick the package up on Saturday and likely won’t get it until Monday. Their organization is so bad that even if I wanted to pick up the package and not make them deliver it, they take 24 hours to find it. Had a similar thing happen with Fedex, went to the shipping center and was given my package within 5 minutes."
"arrive soon and really nice guy, well packaged, no damage at all!"
"This is the worst shipping company ever, sad how far this company has fallen. they delivered package to wrong addresses; this is not the 1st time, mind you, my home is the only one on the street with the address numbers marked on the mailbox. I filed a claim, 2 minutes later they noted that the investigation is complete, and the package was confirmed delivered via there proof of delivery??? what proof the package proof of delivery has no gps plot points to confirm location package was scanned at, no picture of where package was left and this is a amazon requirement. now I have to fight for my $200 Christmas present with shipper, bank, etc. all because ups is completely incompetent. and its not like I have another $200 to purchase another gift. horrible service, horrible customer service, you have to talk to a computer the whole process ?? there system is set up as if they never make a mistake. I will never purchase an item via any company that ships with ups. thanks for a great Christmas ups"
What went right start with that well i went and picked up my package myself. Took a day off to get my package opened all windows sat at home ALL DAY. About noon got a message about my package being delivered but no one was home. LIES!! Called spoke with someone at the UPS office and driver was bringing it by late. So upon agreeing with that i waited and watched my camera to see how my son and i could have missed the delivery guy. Well to our surprise the driver never came. There is nowhere on my camera a UPS delivery guy all day i waited and nothing so i called back to UPS and was given pick up information. I will gladly go and pick my packages up just so i don't have to deal with the lies anymore. The only good part was the amazing customer service i got from your UPS office on Farmington RD in Summerville SC
Multiple times I've had ups driver claim he attempted to deliver my package but they missed me. That's bull. I was always home. I have a small apartment so no way did I not hear a knock. You hear everything in my apartment. I've complained to customer service and they pretty much didn't care and blocked me from sending more emails because I told them they have drivers that lie and too lazy to actually walk to your apartment. They even tried to say once that it was a signature required package and it was not. Then they said it was for security of package to not leave at my door. I live inside a locked building that they have the code for to get in. Never once has there been a problem with packages here. It always seems to happen to my packages that are scheduled on a Friday. Hmmm I can't even tell them to deliver it to a closer location either without paying to be able to. You'd think the fact that I paid them to ship my product would at least include that courtesy. I have a lot of things shipped and so far I've been able to change about half of my shipments I get from various companies to other shippers. Usually fed ex so that's been a lot nicer and less stress. Some of my packages are needed within a certain time frame and I plan for it but still doesn't make it half the time. So now it's Friday and I have to wait till the end of the day Monday to drive way further then I need to as there is a ups store a block away from me. So this just gave me the incentive to start back up with changing the shipper with the remaining companies I order from. It's amazing that I pay them to deliver something and they don't hold up there end of the bargain. Their customer support is worthless too.
"We placed our order from a First Nations owned business in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for our Cultural Care Package initiative for the Michigan Native American community during the December holidays. This is a $2,000 order of hand sanitizer for our community especially elders, home-bound, disabled, boarding school survivors, etc. Order placed on 12/2/22, shipped 12/5 from Edmonton, and arrived in Louisville, KY, on 12/7. The packages have been in Louisville for 10 days so far. We had to fill out 2 forms on ""toxic substance control declaration."" This is hand sanitizer and the company has A TON of customers in the US. It is BS that they never called us on 12/7 when it is noted they needed clearance for this package. It is very rude and so last minute we had to come up with another item to go into the Cultural Care Packages. I know our community members will be pleased with the contents we could provide but this terrible terrible customer service! It seems personal and perhaps are they being racist toward our organization. That is not the case because UPS is just bad. After reading thousands of bad reviews this company like Quickbooks and other large corporations are so bad, so impersonal, etc. They could learn a lot from small businesses and non-profits that actually care about bettering humanity and all our relations!

Some of the most recent updates and as of 12/16/22 the packages have still not shipped.

12/15/2022 @ 11:04 A.M. On the WayYour package is pending release from a Government Agency. Once they release it, your package will be on its way.
12/15/2022 @ 11:04 A.M. UPS has received the information needed to submit your package for clearance."
"They will open your package and ship the empty wrapping, deny any claim saying it was poorly wrapped. UPS enables its employees to steal, don’t ship here"
This store don't deserve any stars from my experience on Friday 12/16/22. Hours of operation at this UPS was 8:30am to 6:30pm. I arrived at 6:22pm. This store was already closed. I race to this store before 6:30pm and was told by a short chubby white long blonde haired man with a long beard that the store was already closed at 6:22pm. The lights of the store was off at 6:33pm and the employees were already walking out the store.
"Their website and website setup is complete garbage and a complete joke.

Go it pay bill on line to receive a package and it’s a run around trying to find the right place to pay. Login to “my choice” to pay bill but it doesn’t give you the option but to sign up again. Try to sign up again and it says you already have a “my choice”, account.

Ticket on door says pay bills online with my “infonotice”. I’ve searched the site to enter the number and no where you can enter this number.

Website is crap and needs to be completely redone to make it more user friendly.

Figured out how to pay online and the amount is different from the slip on my door!!! Now what? Watch they will want me to pay again because their system is archaic.."
"I sent package through PakMail via UPS. The package was delivered by UPS, but no one was home. Receiver called them and UPS said they will redeliver or hold at a facility for 5 days . Package was sent back the very next day to PakMail for sender, without re-delivering or holding at a facility. I spent an entire day calling and being sent to a robot for about 15 times without resolving the issue. PakMail won’t refund my money because it was UPS that didn’t do their job correctly. UPS was so difficult to reach, and don’t know when they will refund my money ($47.63 ) The kids won’t get their Christmas gifts in time, waisted an entire day trying to reach UPS, and don’t know if I will get my money back. Horrible experience and terrible costumer service."
Terrible customer service. I wasn't able to speak to anyone & can't find my package. Never use them if you don't have to
"Wasnt home for the first time they delivered, left the slip on the door. After that they never came back and basically said they would reimburse 100$. Drivers are thieves."
"I've had a company send me multiple orders to an address through UPS. The success rate is about 60%. So about half the time, they cannot deliver to this address for some reason. I have spoken with a CSR (customer service representative) multiple times. Each time they spout useless information and they cannot help you at all. They lie constantly to cover their lack of basic knowledge required for their job. I just contacted them again about the same issue and the CSR just kept saying that the address is wrong. I went through everything with them again and asked them what would I need to do to fix this. I gave them the address to review and asked them if it was a format issue. They couldn't answer and just hung up on me. It's too bad this company doesn't offer other shipping options. I wouldn't mind seeing UPS go out of business."
"UPS Costa Rica is using the duty system to steal money. A package arrived and I received a phone call about import duty. The package, a surprise from a friend in the US, was declared at $10 (a high figure, frankly) and they wanted $32. I called UPS San Jose to clarify and get a refund and the desk did nothing, then hung up. Now I gotta chase which Tico re-coded it so they could crime."
"Whom ever created the 800 # answering service is lacking human resource skills I’ll just leave it at that.
From now on I will do everything possible to avoid using UPS for delivery."
Can it get lower than 1? They'd be better served saying we have no customer service than subjecting people to that!
"I was informed that the delivery would be delayed, and then no more messages. It's been 12 days, and Christmas is around the corner. What a way to treat a customer."
"Yesterday, UPS came by while I was gone and didn't drop off the package.

I got a sticker note with the ""will try again on next delivery day"" checkmarked.

Then, there's a handwritten note by the delivery person saying ""Left at CVS"".

Which one is it? Will it be delivered again or is it at CVS?
What CVS?

Secondly, I have received dozens and dozens of packages from Amazon, and not once did it ask for a signature.
UPS, you got to change your delivery procedures and hire someone who knows what they are doing at this route."
"UPS gave me a del date of 14/12/23 confirmed via email on 6/12/23. On the 13/12/23, the status changed to 'redelivery requested' (not by me) and del date was removed. At 11:43 on 15/12/23, they emailed me with a delivery date of 16/12/23. However, at 15:23 on 15/12/23. the rug was delivered. There was no-one home and they left the rug outside the front door, without getting a signature from anyone."
Efficient on time delivery with tracking notification
"2 shipments from the same company, with many months apart, both shipments got stolen, the moment they was delivered. 1min after delivery the packages was gone. the same company as sender and the same size of packages.

very corrupt delivery personel."
"I would give a negative 10 rating if i could. This company is the worst. They delivered my package to the wrong house, I had to drive around looking for it. The second time I used them they said my address was wrong and sent my order back. My phone number was on all the packages and never did they try to call to confirm. And I signed up for the updates on the app and never got a single update about the order, What a joke"
UPS need to hire better workers. I was waiting on my package yesterday and the person never rung the doorbell or knocked. These workers sucked. 2 white guys go figure!! I just now received my package a day late. Just pulled up and drove off. Y'all need to train more or hire smarter people!!
"Deserves zero stars. Again today I attempted to get satisfactory help regarding our business account that mysteriously has dropped the preferred rate discount we have always had. I went online to quote shipping to a customer and got a cost, then the next day entered exactly the same info to go ahead with the order, then it came up as almost double. We also have UPS clear our imports so this active is certainly active. After many exasperating calls to their HELP (what a joke), no help at all just someone in the Philippines, with poor English and less comprehension of English, struggling to answer my questions with a rooster crowing in the background. Many apologies from her but no help. And when I asked to speak with someone in Canada she pretended to attempt this and said no one in Canada was available."
"Ordered an UPS for international delivery - prepared all the boxes, called UPS days before to make sure we followed the right instruction. The collection guy came through check the boxes laughed in our face and said wrong documents and turn is back to us. Leaving us with all the boxes. Called 25 times customer service and no one could help, I mean it NO ONE. No one could explained what and how to filled up those documents apparently now required despite we called days before to make sure we had everything ready. Lost a day in calls and lost lots of money. Absolutely disappointed by the unprofessional service of UPS. I'll never recommended anyone to use it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
These people should be put out of business I've been waiting for my package for three days two days ago It was supposed to be sent to a store for me to pick up its not there I called myself tracking the truck and it stood on one street for three hours the next time I order something I will make sure they don't use ups
I’m going to add into the chorus of people with terrible experiences here. You literally cannot get past the automated service to talk to a human being. She repeats herself constantly and reads back the numbers wrong every time. I have spent the last TWO HOURS trying to get through to a person and gave up. UPS broke a turntable I meticulously packed with bubble wrap & styrofoam. It was marked FRAGILE everywhere and yet it looked like it was thrown out a window going downhill at 90 miles an hour. I am so unbelievably pissed off right now. Will never use UPS again. UPS: Do you even read these hundreds of complaints? Fix yourself!
"Do yourself a favor. Don't use UPS and check that the providers you buy from or senders you receive packages from don't use them either. This company has minimal control of its business. I ordered a package express over 1 month ago. Transport price: 200 EUR. Time to arrival: 5 days. The package showed up 1 month and 3 days later. Had I not followed up myself it would be lost. UPS changed the delivery address and therefore they didn't deliver it. They left it on a pick up point, and despite having all contact info at no point choose to contact (their drivers don't have phones, they say :-/). All along, their tracking system online says that package it's at their UPS warehouse. After endless calls and emails, they ask you to go pick up in THEIR UPS warehouse (despite you paid for home delivery), confirming package is there. When you go to the warehouse, package is not there anyway. No explanations. Being at their warehouse feels like being in hell. Always a confused client there, some of them with tears in their eyes, looking for packages. UPS says they have given my package to the regular post office (I could have bought from them to begin with), but when you check it's not there either. Box was in the UPS warehouse, after all, they say the next day. Send a new driver, again to a wrong address. You have to call them again. The company takes 0 responsibility for its work, and tries to point the finger at you, the client, insinuating its your fault. Their customer service phone line is in Portugal, so be prepared to bounce from one customer rep to the other, both on the phone and email. When you ask them for a refund or retribution, they deny it. Management shines by its absence. Everyone you talk to, is clearly worn out and largely clueless. They give you the same lines over and over again, as if reading from a book. In other words, a very expensive nightmare. Stay away. Use other vendors and if you still decide to use UPS (you really shouldn't), make sure you double check everything underway both via phone and email. This company, in Norway at least, has very little control for its business and is very little customer friendly, no matter how much you paid them directly or through a third party. Are you a freight forwarder using UPS as subcontractor, you should really think again if you want to still do this. It's not good for your clients."
I would give a negative rating if I could but UPS in the Rapid City South Dakota area is the worst option for shipping of any kind. There's nobody to get a hold of and UPS National is garbage because you cannot even speak to a representative and we continue to get packages delivered to the wrong address when our address is plainly visible. Complete garbage service.
"UPS makes it impossible to speak to someone in customer service. They have lost 9 of our packages this year alone and they say ""we have filed an investigation"" I've asked numerous times what this means and they are unable to explain. 10 days later, they tell me to file a claim."
"Still waiting for package sent on 22/06/2022. Never arrived at destination. Called UPS 25+ times, and emailed 15 times. Every time they asked me the same information (customer number etc) and then ensured they will deliver it.

Now I managed to get through customer service after hours of waiting and they say: 'we cannot retrieve your package,apologies' And I am asking to make a claim they answer 'you can't as it's past the 3 months period'.

UPS has apparently lost a £800 package and they can't explain why or provide a solution.

AVOID"
"UPS is so bad, I avoid ordering from companies that deliver with them."
"Shocking service.
Don't ring doorbell,tell you to go to access point where they haven't delivered the stuff.Two days later it gets there ..Will not buy anything from company that uses UPS"
"I ordered a product from Amazon, and for USD 1.99, they delivered on the same day.
Guess who cannot find my address after I paid EXPEDITED delivery? UPS.
They delayed delivery of a package from Cymbiotika, claiming my address is incorrect. I clicked the link I found on the tracking page, and confirmed that it is my address. Result? They returned it to the sender.
Now I have a package from Monos. A lady from Georgia called and asked me for an apartment number. I told her I cannot provide her one because this is a house. She said she will let the local UPS know. This was Monday and the seller had paid expedited one day delivery having posted it last Friday.
Still no sign of the package.
And you wonder why Amazon is taking over everything.
I got packages from Japan, Singapore (good old USPS) and FedEx. The only one who can't find my address is the wonderful delivery UPS guy of my area"
"A driver left a message from unknown number to call back in regards to my parcel. He didn’t speak clear and couldn’t understand the number he said but I guessed and called back but the number doesn’t exist.

I searched for support sumner and called. It connected to US center. The guy just read the information that I could even look up online. Told me Australian support number which I can also see online. I told him that’s the number I called and it connected to you.
Then he said,
“Have a good day” and I got hung up.

What's the point of having a support UPS?
Your staff don’t speak clear, no contact number that works, your staff is literary sucks."
"2nd time delivery LATE even tho I paid extra
No update, out for delivery then NOTHING!!!"
Delivery prompt. No complaints.
"The absolute worst. Never use UPS.
A gift requiring a signature was delivered during working hours during the Christmas holiday season, of course when no one was home because people have jobs during regular working hours.When asked to re-deliver on the same day when someone was finally home, the answer was no. Instead, I was informed that I could pick it up at a local UPS center BUT only after paying a fee. ARE YOU KIDDING ME !! This is ridiculous. If I could give zero stars to UPS, I would but that option is not available. I will never use UPS and I will recommend that others do not either."
"UPS claimed they delivered a package to my door. I went to the local UPS center to see where the package was. When they called the driver, he said he delivered it to the wrong address. They don't know when he can go retrieve it, if at all. I'll be careful not to buy anything from places that ship with UPS."
"Ordered from a company that used UPS. I followed the tracking online, checking it about every 20 min. When I saw it said delivered I went to the door and there was my $75 package sitting there. Driver did not even bother to knock on the door. 600 unit apt complex and he couldn't knock on my door to let me know he was delivering the package. I think that is horrible customer service."
"I returned a package back to Nike using the UPS dropbox mailbox,my package was never picked up and somehow stolen out the mailbox.Filed a claim.Dispatch recommended to never use the UPS mailbox because packages can get stolen out of it,if it’s not secure why still have it as an option! I asked about a refund and dispatch said there’s no way to prove that It was actually dropped it off so I wouldn’t be able to get get a refund."
"I avoid UPS, but had to use their bad service two times in my life because of Sender. I paid for door-to-door delivery, but after long period of waiting had to drive personally to the their office far away in the city.
Not satisfied."
Useless. Been delayed 3 days in a row. No communication and no way to reach anyone. The parcel was sent 5 days ago and has been an hour from me for 4 days
I bought a whole Ipad just for it to be thrown on my doorstep at delivery! that is honest just absurd and ignorant! get it together or don’t be a delivering service if you can’t do it right 🤷‍♀️
"I shipped a tube with artwork to a friend who was transferred to the UK via UPS. It took almost 3 months, was bounced back and forth, beat to hell, cost $275 and then they made her pay a duty on her own artwork! UPS is a joke! I mailed a second puece of artwork last week thinking I'd take the chance since it was only going an hour and a half away and one week later it has been delivered to my ranch! These people are ridiculous!"
I would rather shot myself in the face than to deal with UPS.
"The UPS driver left an extremely heavy chair , ordered through Costco, without ringing my doorbell ( I had stayed home to be here for the delivery), at the bottom of the 10 stairs to my front door. Totally impossible for me to move it up the stairs. I am a 74 year old woman. Very unhappy with Costco and UPS."
"There is no such thing as a more incompetent UPS!
Like so many other users, I was subjected to the same bad joke: the deliveryman dropped the package at the relay point and not at the - precise - address indicated. Then, and this is the last straw, the UPS people on the phone or via Messenger promise a new home delivery, but it never arrives!
Liars with that!"
The driver claimed door delivery which was untrue. I got no notice of a package until I called ups for help. The package sat in a pick up spot for nearly 2 weeks. The UPS agent told me drivers routinely lie about attempting site delivery. Also brokerage fees are outrageous.
I really hate ups .this is the worst company ever.they always say my package is delivered and it’s never there.can’t never talk to anybody. I need some help finding my package. They didn’t leave a note or anything.these driver don’t know what the hell they doing they never ring the bell like they suppose to.this just ridiculous
My package was delivered by ups damaged and someone at ups opened up my package and stole a $400 item. The package weighed 11lbs on the ups site and was delivered to my door only weighing less than a pound. The delivery tag had a rip on it and the package was double taped. Plus their site or app will not let me start a claim and you can't file a claim over the phone. They are the worst delivery service on the planet.
"Get rid of your virtual assistant so problems can be ironed out. I'm sick and tired of trying to get through to a person and you can't get anything done with that virtual assistant. Missing a package, can't get any help and just plain flat sick and tired of spending all this time trying to get my package to me. Will never use UPS again!!"
"Ordered a package from Lenovo late November. Was stuck in a warehouse without an update or next steps for two weeks. Phoned UPS to see what was wrong and I needed to get the Import Tax ID from Lenovo. Why do I have to sit on customer service hold to get that for you?!?! Absolute joke of a company. Whenever anything is shipped with UPS I always have problems. The brown in their logo matches their service, crap."
"POR FAVOR NO CONFIAR ES UPS
SE ESTAN ROBANDO LOS PAQUETES Y LOS REPORTAN COMO DANADOS Y ES UN PROBLEMA PARA QUE RESPONDAN
DEBERIAN DEPURAR UPS Y SACAR A TANDO LADRON QUE ESTA PERFUDICANDO A MUCHOS CLIENTES"
"Zero customer service from UPS, you simply cannot speak to a human being! Their chatbot is useless and when you phone their voice recognition system simply does not work and goes round in an endless loop!
I have a very clear telephone voice and yet it cannot correctly identify the tracking number. After speaking this for 10 times with no success I unsurprisingly gave up. What's the point in the voice recognition looping roun forever? If it can't identify the tracking number after several attempts it needs to put the caller through to someone who can. The impression is that there is nobody there to answer customer queries. My parcel is way overdue and I'm still none the wiser."
"I wish I could give a zero, because that is what you deserve, the worst delivery company I have ever come across,very incompetent, very pathetic in deed.I can never recommend to anyone.Nonsense!!!!!!"
"I was told my delivery would be on Wednesday between 9.50 and 13.30, so decided we would go shopping Tuesday morning. However, on Tuesday at 8.49 I received an email that the delivery would be Tuesday, same time slot, so decided we would go shopping in the afternoon. 13.30 came and went with no sign of a UPS van, so at 14.10 I rang UPS and was told the delivery slot had been changed to 'before the end of the day'! No one thought to inform me about this change, so now I have had to cancel going shopping and have wasted a whole day waiting for a parcel! I don't think I will ever use UPS to send a parcel as I wouldn't want the recipient to suffer the same inconvenience as I have just suffered."
They had my package then the driver had got spooked by a dog I been calling for my package and they giving me the runaround.i still haven't seen it or received it yet.then everybody is asking do I have a dog I said no I do not have a dog.and I can get it redelivered. Then they sent it to the post office.they weren't no help either.
"Absolutely atrocious. One parcel was delivered by a UPS driver. One week later with a different parcel, the UPS driver couldn't find exactly the same address. The delivery was delayed while they had to 'confirm' the address, which was exactly the same address. Still waiting for the parcel. Terrible customer service who couldn't actually do anything."
The most uselesss delivery service I have ever come across . They will never come to your address and notify the merchant receiver was not home . Please kindly delivery my Dior item . it’s been over two weeks you held my item at your warehouse . Return back to Dior or deliver my god damn shoes . Pls do not ever shop from a merchant that uses UPS
"Quite possibly the worst delivery company ive ever dealt with. Twice in one week my packages were not delivered to me when they were supposed to have been. The first time it was ""out for delivery"" then magically there was some severe weather impacting the delivery, while it is winter, there was nothing within in my province or the surrounding ones that would constitute bad weather AT ALL. Furthermore the package was delivered the next day, that ""severe"" weather sure cleared up quickly, however all the product I was receiving which was skin care, was frozen. The second time the tracking stated it was ""OUT FOR DELIVERY"" somehow it didnt make it to me that day either and im still waiting on that one. Customer service was absolutely USELESS. Im sure I could have answered more of my own questions than what the customer service rep was able to answer.
Cant wait to receive more frozen, potentially damaged and definitely not on time skincare! Thanks UPS."
Friday I noticed what I thought was trash at the end of my driveway beside the neighboring air bnb house (right beside the dumpster) I didn’t think anything of it because I hadn’t been notified of any packages being delivered. Today(Monday) I drove my son to the bus stop and noticed it was a package so I looked at the sticker and realized it was my 40$ package!😳 This package could have been set beside the mailboxes (about 30-40 feet away) or brought to my door (about 100-200 feet away) instead it was thrown beside an air bnb dumpster which is driven past multiple times a day (risking destruction or even theft of my package) i get a lot of stuff delivered to my house and have never had this issue with any other company! I will be sticking to Amazon/fedex delivery from now on.
Impossible to get a customer service rep on the phone. What sucks is the virtual assistant asking for your tracking number. I spoke it slowly and very clearly. Tried 4 times. It kept repeating back numbers that weren’t even close. UPS.. Pls eliminate that 1st step to get to a real live individual.
The worst experience I’ve ever had with an international company. Honestly they should shut down this company. They don’t give a ***** about customers and their experience. UPS is a worldwide piece of *****
"The shi...iest delivery service on earth. I am waiting for a package that was supposed to arrive last Monday (5th december ) to Milan via UPS . It did not arrive that day. It was reprogrammed to 6th december. On 6th december i received a notification that the courier did not find my name on that gate. So taken back. The courier did not even bother to call me on my phone. I called the call center and they told me phone number is not a guarantee. I asked for putting at a UPS access center, so i can get it personally but was rejected this request. It should arrive to me on 7th december and they asked more details. On 7th december received a notification that tomorrow is bank holiday, then 8th was also a bank holiday. I was supposed to receive it today (9th december) and did not receive it. I called the customer service again and they told me that it will arrive now next Monday because tomorrow is weekend again. so a package arrived from Asia to Europe in one day but it is taking them 9, days to bring it to me. Keep also in mind that i needed this package urgent, so i paid more for this to the supplier. I did not go out of home all week because this s..t courier was to arrive changing each day , day and timing.
What a s..t service UPS is.
Anyone who uses this service, please get informed. This is my second time with this s..t courier service. I have to suffer every time because they are inefficient and have a very non functional courier service atleast in Italy."
Ups lost my package and will not help correct there mistake they keep giving me different expecting dates and my package never shows up I don't recommend using or ordering anything that has to do with ups
This company is a disgrace they literally will not pay me for my cell phone. I am out a iPhone 13 promax. I mailed it to them with their UPS prepaid label UPS lost the package.Ups refuses to pay me because technically due to the fact that I used the company Decluttr their prepaid label through ups ! Decluttr is considered the shipper not me! Decluttr wants a receipt from UPS that the package was excepted. All UPS did with Scan it in at a cvs ups drop off they never gave me a receipt! They have all of the tracking information to prove it was lost and I’m out a thousand dollar phone because of it!? No way! I will fight this daily until I receive my money I will take it to court if I have too! This company is not trustworthy. Decluttr barely communicated with me ignored my emails. I had to contact the Better Business Bureau to even get a response. They are condescending in their replies and it’s been over a month since I mailed it and they’re just now responding through the Better Business Bureau! The best part about it as one of the customer representatives for this company told me in their one of three responses in an email prior to me contacting the Better Business Bureau that it was OK I didn’t have a receipt and that they could still move forward with my claim! So I have that email saved they literally lied! They just don’t want to give me my money! But I will continue to fight this daily and post on every single website a review of my horrible experience I will continue to fight this they are a horrible company! Do yourself a favor look elsewhere before mailing them any of your expensive electronics! Avoid the headache I been enduring over a month! And the fact that ups lost this package in their Georgia shipping center! And don’t just pay me my money due is a disgrace! I’m pretty sure one of their own workers robbed my package! Disgusting!
"Can not efficiently deal with the import, business or private, useless. Outsourced all customs paperwork, and the 3rd party company is not answering phone calls, no email to write to."
"My package is stuck one week in middle of road. And I can't contact UPS customer service, because there is option to contact them by FB or Twiter and I don't have these accounts. And for contacting them by email I must creat UPS account.
Very bad service."
"UPS is the worst. They failed to deliver a Kiehls package with 5 items. When I asked Kiehls to investigate, Kiehls said I had to deal with UPS directly because Kiehls would not help. UPS claimed to have tried to ""contact"" me. I forwarded my mobile phone call ""recent call"" list and NONE were from from UPS. The automated system for UPS is a joke. It does not address the problem and then hangs up. Kiehls and UPS engage in a circuitous scam blaming each other. They do not asnwer the phone and do not take reponsibility for failing to deliver. DO NOT do business with Kiehls or UPS. They scam customers."
I was informed Friday that my order was delivered.Well that was a lie. It took me making 4 calls for the rep to tell me that was the incorrect tracking number. I have proof of the tracking number on the order that purchased. I'm very disgusted with UPS. I'll never ship anything thru UPS. Package might get lost again.
"I have been to two UPS stores recently. The store in East Robinson Road was excellent. Very willing to assist the customer and very patient. This review is for the UPS store on Transit Road in East Amherst. They are horrible. I needed to have the box sealed but was unable to get everything back into it to do so. Instead of expressing understanding that that happened or -- even better -- offering to try to help, his comment was, ""How is that my responsibility?"" Very rude, especially since there was NO ONE in the store. I will never step inside that store again."
Poor communication and missed delivery slots
Package was 300 miles from destination on Saturday on Sunday package was sent across the country and is now 3000 miles away yet supposed to be delivered tomorrow?!?!
This is the third time that I did not get my package. And they don't take a picture when package is delivered. So there's no way of knowing if it was stolen or not delivered at all.
"I tried shipping packages back to my previous employer on their account. 1 UPS store owner in Anaheim Hilss said ""I won't ship there is no money in it for me"". 2nd store owner in Orange says ""I can't charge to an account I can only take cash or card"". Called UPS they lied when I caught them in a lie they hung up."
Incompetent lying through their teeth items not delivered on the day and returned saying that there was no one at home. Even when you complain and you get a call from Ben at Sheffield depot who assured you that you will get your item on Saturday between 8 and 12 when they do not deliver Saturday. Substandard service from customer service to delivery. Do not use them
"They push delivery onto local USPS who does not deliver to my house. They (usps) are weeks out of getting their backlog of packages sorted, so my package that was supposed to be delivered yesterday will be 2-3 more weeks. All this is because UPS could not be bothered to drive the couple miles extra to get the package to me instead of the post office. Shame on you UPS, you should fulfill your own contracts for delivery."
Would give negative stars if available! Spoken to 4 different account managers about not getting packages delivered to the location of my house that is specifically identified on my UPS account. Have even put up a sign on the door about it yet still does not happen. Call customer service and they read a script that doesn't help and are so worried about getting you off the phone. This ridiculous! Don't use UPS the drivers cannot follow simple instructions to deliver to the side door on the big deck (the only deck attached to my house)
I find it so inconvenient after all these years your driver's don't have ways to contact a customer if they leave Contact Information therefore now Instead of having my Item today as I was supposed to I now have to wait a Business day and since today is a Saturday I have to wait Until Monday.Poor Company All Around.
"If I could give this place a zero in stars I would. In short, my uncle died last week. We wanted to have some of his things shipped to us. It was wrapped in bubble wrap a ton. There was also a lot of signs on the box labeled fragile. when I tell you this box was beat up, there was literally a hole in it. They clearly just threw the box inside the truck. These things cannot be replaced and I am sick over this! No amount of money could replace it. Terrible company. I don’t know how every single item in the box could be broken. Inexcusable"
"It is the second time that UPS does not deliver on the date it announces. The drivers do not call you, they just leave a note, in Greece at least there is no delivery point, even if there is the procedure that you are asked to do with registration, it is time-consuming, so we pay for transport for non-existent service... one has to be very lucky to get them or be locked in the house for 2 days from the date they announce that they will deliver. Unacceptable"
My simple package got 'stuck' in Spanish customs. Basically it took 14 days to receive from the UK - It seemed that I had to do the legwork to find out what the holdup was - I called and emailed over several days. UPS 'Customer Support' should be renamed (you are kept at arms length by a pleasant person reading a menu in a country who's minimum wage is less than in the country you are calling from) Eventually I was sent the customs clearance documents. I did actually have to check my calendar to double check - this is the 21st century
Delivered to the wrong number house in the wrong street name on the wrong day and left a rug outside.
💩Ups (ooops)💩always the best 🤡🎪. Another delivery another story 🤣🤣 i get notice that my parcel arrived to drop 💩off point(just 💩ooops🤡ups🤡 got that 💩) and off course as expected down there 🚫nothing.

"Because UPS lost my package I'm not able to re order because the PC memory is sold out. UPS you have caused me time and money because your incompetence. Where is my compensation for my lost time and money you lost my package, this is UPS fault and blame. There should be COMPENSATION for lost time and money!"
"It has gotten to the point where I check which delivery service the company I'm buying an item from uses, and if it's ups I won't buy from that company. Any package I've ordered that was lost was them. They must hire their employees from a school of the mentally disabled or something because it's unbelievable how stupid A LOT of the drivers are. On more than one occasion I've had drivers leave an expensive package on the front steps of my BUILDING (not my apartment door, but outside in the sidewalk) and I live in NYC. Without a doubt it is going to be stolen and they've accepted 0 responsibility either time or any time over ever lost something. One time they lost a package, I called and told them and they said "" no we didn't we delivered it too bad"". 2 months later it was sitting on my stairs to my apartment which obviously means someone lost it in the warehouse or truck, marked it delivered, found it way later and just dropped it off. They are a scumbag company with a lot of scumbag employees. Do not use this service under any circumstances if it is imperative you receive your package, which when isn't it?"
I was home all day they never delivered my package and said that it was missed delivery. The delivery driver needs to be fired for lying.
They're the worsttttttt I swear man. How can they be that bad sheesh???
"UPS is claiming 3 attempts for delivery and none of them has been made. No sign or prove of passage. No way to contact them. Only a dumb chat bot. You can't even check they have got the right address. No SMS, No phone, no nothing. The worst delivery service ever !"
"I had a package shipped out to me on the 2nd. The tracking number said it would be delivered by the 8th. It came to my city on the 7th and left for 3 hours south the same day. What? Why? It is now the 9th. Says it will be delivered today but it's not out for delivery and I haven't received any updates since it left for the city 3 hours south on the 7th. I spoke with customer service and saved the conversation. They were absolutely zero help. They literally said I will just have to wait 14 days and see. This is how you do business? You are making USPS look good, and I didn't think that was possible. You should be a shamed."
"UPS has lost multiple packages of mine over the last year and a half. Most recently a tracking number was never sent to me after shipping at the store, and then the package got stuck at the local delivery center for more than a week. Opened an investigation and was told it closed almost immediately after and marked as lost, which means they made 0 effort to even look for it. Horrible customer service, thats the result I got after 2 hours of being transferred on call and waiting on automated bots."

"First order of kitchen blinds delivered in November were received damaged, the packaging was sufficient but 'fragile' and 'this way up' labels ignored. The UPS delivery driver rang bell but hurried away after leaving it on my doorstep. At once I could see that the package was bent at one end. After complaining to the supplier, a replacement blind was delivered today. Guess what? Yes... that too was damaged in the same way. I tried to attract the driver's attention but he shrugged and drove away. Angry email sent to UPS UK"
"Wednesday, December 7th 2022. UPS says my package was delivered and it was not on my door step. I watched as they drove right past my house. Call customer service and gotta file a complaint. Thursday December 8th, 2022. While sitting in the hospital while my 4 year old is in surgery, I get the delivery notification that my packages where delivered. Call home to get husband to grab them off the step, and low and fu**king behold, not there. Now I'm Pis*sed. 2 days in a dang row. 5 packages saying they are delivered but clearly not to my address. Customer service sucks. If I could give no stars, that's what it woulda been."
"Lazy courier driver, asked me to come and collect from our main entrance (I live on the second floor, every other delivery person delivers to my personal front door, because that is what they are PAID to do) for a massive PC tower that my daughter had ordered, the worse part is that he left it completely unattended in the communal hallway.

No customer service what so ever!

I called and emailed to complain about both issues raised above, this was their response:

Hello

This is a block of flats the driver called the number on the parcel and the lady came down

goods have been delivered

regards

ups


This does not address my complaint in any way, it just states what happened! I have decided to stop making online purchases full stop. I cannot cope with these companies and if more people did the same, maybe they would improve their service.. they would not have a choice.

There was also zero tracking information supplied, a day later and still states that it has not been delivered on their system. The website is appalling, it just sends you around in circles, and you have to register to send an email.

Too much admin, not worth any of the hassle. Forget it."
I work for ups and they are very bad company they lie to there costumers!tl the head of the company doesn't care at all.if u can don't use ups!!!
Efficient and courteous - arrived at 10pm the night before we were expecting it - very dedicated staff.
"Rubbish courier . Try to deliver a package . No answer so take it away , leave no collection details . Why do company’s use this rubbish firm??"
Rubbish company as usual in the UK. Keep delaying package iv. Given up waiting...sad to see the UK going down the drain.
"Great service.

I used UPS for the first time to avoid the strikes at the other place. Sent a parcel to Ireland with a 3 day delivery estimate. My customer and I were delighted when the parcel got delivered the next day! Really impressed."
Worst experience I’ve ever had unreliable drivers cannot find a simple house address. Instead ask me for my apartment #. I live in a house. Saying no one was home when we are. Has to be the 💩est courier service ever. Shame on you UPS. And this is the 3rd time.
"My UPS driver went out of his way to make sure I got my package! It needed a signature, and I had received notification of a time frame for delivery. I took off work to get there, and got a notice that I had missed the delivery; it was an hour before the delivery window. I went to my local UPS store (Meeker St. Richmond CA) and Chris, a driver happened to be there. He tracked down my package and brought it to me the next morning. THANK YOU!"
"They don't deliver as promised, now have been waiting an extra week even though I paid for fast delivery, such a shoddy company"
"I had the worst customer service experience with UPS this afternoon. First off, I received a note on my door stating that UPS driver attempted to deliver my package but I was at home all day near my front door and did not hear any knocks or door bell being rang to note delivery had arrived. I reached out to UPS support via chat and expressed my concerns with this poor 'delivery attempt'. The chat representative assured me that someone would be calling me back from customer support. I received a call from a customer support representative that was immediately rude and talked down to me regarding the delivery attempt. I let her know that I have been home within 3 feet of my door all day and did not hear any knocks or my door bell rang when the delivery attempt was made. She then began talking over top of me and noted the driver said he knocked 3 times but the TV was very loud and the rep then made a snarky comment that if my TV volume wasn't so loud I may have heard that driver was there. UPS generally rings the doorbell when packages are dropped to my home, especially if a signature is required. The representative proceeds to continue talking rude over top of my noting how the drivers never ring the doorbell because they aren't sure if they work. What sense does that make?!! As I proceeded to explain previous deliveries the driver rang the doorbell, she began yelling over top of me as I expressed how unprofessional she was and then resulted in me cursing in defense. This was a horrible experience across the board, especially on the customer service representative's side. I too work in customer service and know that sometimes it can be a busy and difficult role but it is never acceptable to be rude and talk down on others when they call in for assistance."
May parcel has not been delivered its been dispached since 28/11/22
"Total crap as I had a package delivered to someone. It said it was delivered but the person I sent it to did not get the package. So someone just got an expensive Coach purse, that was NOT theirs. And to file a claim, total bs!!"
"UPS never deliver my orders!!

They can’t find me, don’t call because I have a Belgian phone number in Ireland….it’s the 3 rd order that I don’t’ receive because of UPS! I’m furious….I’ve spent time in the phone with nice indian people not knowing where I was and how to help me! A real shame!
Hopefully I’ll be refund for all this list orders.

Audrey Bruyr"
This is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I literally will cancel my order moving forward if UPS is delivering. Every single time they deliver my package to a random address and mark “delivered at door”. Yeah but who’s door???? They give no proof of delivery then say oh someone will call you in an hour and they never do. That’s the solution each time. It’s so difficult this holiday season and any season for that matter relying on your packages to be delivered correctly from this company. I’d trust the Pony Express before I let UPS handle any of my packages.
"I really wish I could give them negative stars. First according to the driver, they made an attempt to delivery which failed for some reason (no one came to my house as I have cameras around my house and no one rang the bell). After calling 5 times to UPS, they said the package is on the truck and it will be delivered before 9pm today which never happened. So, I called 2 times again next day and they said it will be delivered today (also got an email from UPS with timeline) but 2 minutes after hanging up the phone, I got an email from UPS hub that my package is no where to locate. Hence, I called again and International department manager promised me it will be delivered before 7pm which never happened as it is on the truck after connecting with the hub. I called again and this time the CSR was so rude and even screamed at me for the fact I asked her to spell her name so I could write it down. She was so unprofessional that I can’t even describe in words. I asked her if your supervisor does not call me back what should be my next step. She was not answering the question and kept saying I promise they will call back ij 20 mins which never happened. I called again after 1 hour and I insisted that if I have to hold for 1 hour I will like to speak with the manager. This CSR had the guts to say that I will talk to my manager and if we have to I will hang up the phone on me. After 15 minutes of ringing the telephone belll, someone picked up and they said it will be delivered before 9pm, at this point the time was 8.58pm. She said she cannot connect with the hub where it has been sent from, maybe the phone is not working or they are closed, she is not sure. Guess what…delivery never happened. All I heard is we are sorry but we can not reach the hub and the driver and no compensation of wasting 2 days of mine. Please look for smaller or any other big courier company, do not bother with UPS."
"We have a business account with UPS and i have to deal with their invoices. We pay by DD, and they take DD the month after the invoices are dated, and then have the cheek to charge us late payment fees!! its a nightmare trying to get through to anyone as they just pass the buck and say its not their dept so give me an email address, which i never get a reply from. We have several late payment fee invoices which they take DD for but havent actually credited us back.
I tried disputing the invoices on our online portal but they instantly got rejected - saying contact ups

They're a bloody joke!"
Do not ship or work for ups company just bullies people!
"The arrogance, lack of competence and service of this absolutely repugnant company defies any description. In a recurrent habit drivers refuse any delivery attempts and drop the package at pickup point, so the customer has to do the job they get payed for. UPS ""Support""is a cynical effort to show their customers that they couldn't care less by letting everyone run into a concrete wall that is trying to solve the trouble they have caused. An absolutely disgusting company that everyone should avoid like the plague."
These drivers they hire and drive their own cars don't even knock or ring doorbell for packages that need a signature I have on ring her walking up and putting the notice on door and walks away the notice says will be brought to secure location and doesn't even write where at and calling customer service is even more ridiculous.. worthless employees
"For years they have been delivering packages here and I keep telling delivery drivers they are at wrong address. They read address and deliver to my address.
When I read address it don't belong here.
I have decided that all or most of their drivers don't have a school education or just can't read at all.
Guess they don't hire by experience anymore.
Must hire by cheapest labor.
What a shame to this country.
The date of experience below can't get into the window, so posting it here.
March 1999 to current.
This is correct date not below."
The delivery driver stole a package from me 500$ worth of clothes they said they delivered it but never did I have cameras all over house an no one came at the time they said they delivered package do not get anything sent that’s worth money
"I wish i could give 0 stars, because this company does not deserve any positive feedback.
Everytime i order something online and I am unfortunate that UPS is chosen to deliver that stuff, I could start crying. I live at a place where there is a receptionist all day long and during the nighttime (if they decided to deliver that late), there are also people present.
Despite that the delivery driver decides everytime not even leaving his car. Immediatly it goes to attempt failed even tho me sitting at home all day long patiently waiting for my package.

Sometimes it works to drop the package off at delivery boxes, but the latest delivery takes the cake.

The app explicitly tells me to collect my package at their facility close to me. But when I went there they told me they couldn't find it anywhere. Its not in their storage. So now it is my job to contact the original sender of the package, so they can contact UPS and resend the package.
I wouldnt write this review if it was a one time thing. But since it is the same scenario every time, I cant help myself, but trying to warn people, to if it is in any way shape or form possible, to avoid this company"
This is one of the worst companies in this world is ups I will never 🚢 with them again in my life I don't care. Frist of all them lie from top bosses to bottom..I pay for my package 📦 to be delivered at the 2nd of December and up to this day my package can't be delivered 😑 and wen u call them tell you bad weather or the system is not showing them wen it will be delivered and all these foolish things..I will not tell anyone to go with ups ...I have ship so many time with FedEx and never have them kind of problem and the date them give to u is the day your package is getting delivered..bad company is ups is the worst thing...never me again
If you live in a building I I would recommend never and I mean never use UPS unless you enjoy going to pick it up out of UPS access point.. today there was three people home all day long I live on the first floor in a condo building.. sure enough sticky note left in the lobby Even though I paid extra to have a delivered to my door..
"Do not ever use this company. They stole over £100 worth of clothing from me and have possibly the worst customer service team in the whole world. They are awful, and I will never recommend them to anybody. Their delivery driver stole one of my packages and it looks like unfortunately I have to just throw £110 in the bin as they will never give it back to me. Appalling and disgusting."
Cheerful and helpful driver. Package arrived at the projected time.
"UPS often has trouble with our address, however they have a UPS drop point nearby. all other couriers leave packages for us at these designated drop points without issue except UPS. UPS will never attempt to contact me that there is an issue with the address. I have to watch the package and call them to redirect it to the access point at the precise moment it reaches an intermediate fulfillment center. And they still return it to sender half the time, regardless of how many requests to redirect it I make. I sincerely don't understand how this shitshow stays in business."
"I ordered personal photos from a company that does photo prints, I paid my shipping which costed more than the items themselves. UPS lost my photos somewhere and were absolutely NO help. I had 85 photos and they consisted person photos of my family, myself and my children and UPS told me to contact the company, even though UPS is the one who lost them. Now because of UPS my photos could end up in the hands of a stranger. Im so upset and disgusted with their lack of effort to fix an issue that THEY caused."
"DON'T expect UPS will deliver your parcel to your door unless a signature is required. They will lie by saying nobody was home and make you go to their access point to pick it up!! Not once, not twice. It happened to me many times."
I signed the missed you paper and told them the stormdoor was open on the paper but they just left the missed you paper and did not even read. They send my package back to the sender. I was waiting for that item and they should take it to place I could pick it up location to sign for it. They had the package on Sunday but did not deliver it on the day I was home they try to delivery Monday which I am at work. All the time that attempted to deliver my package I was at work. Huge waste of time and money. I would give zero star if they let me.
"I work for a large company, who uses UPS. they do not have ANY customer service and cannot help you with ANYTHING without a tracking number, even though you can call the postal service and check your address for deliveries . this is ridiculous."
Every day they change the delivery date !!! Where is MY pack??? ????????
"My experience with the Batavia, New York UPS store was the worst possible customer service for a shipping service. Not only did they lie to us initially about what UPS could do, but then refused to do anything about the package that was shipped. A refund was not even considered.
We wanted to ship a package of medication to my son in China. Before we used UPS, my wife and I personally went into the store in Batavia, New York and spoke with the supervisor/ manager. He told us that we could send the package to China and bragged about UPS being the best at doing that. In addition, we were reassured after repeatedly asking, that we could send medication in the form of two months supply of pills.

We spent $166.50 to send the package to Shanghai, China. After a month of tracking it, we called the Batavia store and were told to give it more time. After two months we noticed that the package was destroyed due to rules governing deliveries in China. After calling the 800 numbers and never speaking with a human because the machine kept asking for a US zip code, and China does not have zip codes as in the US, I called the Batavia store. After being on hold for three separate calls over the course of an hour and finally speaking to a human being, he informed me that we, as customers took the risk and basically should have known better. He refused to acknowledge that UPS had any responsibility for this package not being delivered. His comment, ""its on you"" and then hanging up on me as well as the whole experience with UPS is the definition of terrible customer service. I would never use UPS for any delivery service."
"I usually have no problem with the usually guy that comes to my area, he is prompt, polite and mostly on time.

However when this guy is on a day off, this particular guy that collected my order 1Z7E524X6892262123, attempted not to scan my parcel at collection, which I find very dodgy as he can then steal it and say it’s never been picked up, when my boyfriend ask him to scan it, he reluctantly did so and replied “happy now?” In a very rude manner, can ups please look into this."
"Place is a joke, went through hell just to get hired get hired on with them weeks go by no body contacts me yet I'm hired in the system I call the Covington,La site multiple times get the run around finally get ahold of the person the text message said Jennifer Ezell was the one I supposed to talk to but she said no she wasn't I was supposed to talk to a dude named Josh that's manager of the drivers or whatever called multiple times finally get ahold of him he says they should have emailed or texted me Said he would send it himself never got anything from him a week later I get a Text from Josh day before Thanksgiving asking if I still want to work said yes, said great be ready to start next week! Next week comes didn't hear any word from him even texted got no response back and another week later he text me you wanting to work? About 20 minutes later he says nevermind. Like why are these incompetent people even hired in management positions is beyond me. They owe my ass for all the BS I went through and still never got to actually work even tho I was in the system as hired...Very unprofessional and unorganized. That Josh guy needs to be fired how you going to Text someone during the Holidays asking wanting to work and few minutes later say nevermind? Playing with my time, money and family guy needs to be canned."
I have had packages lost too many times and no one helps whether I call or use the AI chat. Also they have literally left electronics out in the pouring rain without letting anyone know in my house and now a couple of those do not work anymore… there needs to be something done with this and I am so fed up with it. I wished Amazon could have a option of who delivers it. FedEx has been so much better then ups…
"I would like to not put even one star .
Terrible company, if you need your package in time, it's never will happen!"
The item was left outside my house. No one called me to advise and it could have been stolen. Very surprised considering my phone number was on the delivery sticker.
"If I could leave less than 1 star I would. I ordered my grandson a Disney Cars outfit off of Amazon. UPS Ground delivered it sometime between 8pm lastnight and 9am this morning. They left it on the front porch in the rain. They could have stuck it between our glass screen door and our front door to protect it from the rain but they didn't. Why should they care right, it's not their package? I called customer service to which I was told that someone would call me back to see what they could do to resolve the issue but never received a call back."
Appalling company who clearly employ thieves. I'm still waiting for my goods and a resolution 1 month on. DO NOT USE
Yet again UPS have failed. Out of the last four sendings/receivings 100% have gone badly wrong including the delivery of an empty box with the contents having been carefully removed but at least their insurance paid me £1000. The current delivery from Italy has been sitting in a warehouse in Italy having not even left Italy despite a 2/3 delivery estimate to me in the UK. What in the days gone by was a good company is now a disaster and hopelessly unreliable. Moved over to EVRI which is now far better in every way. Shame on you UPS!
"no drop off points - had to wait for delivery all day

asked for keeping the parcel on their premises - no flexibility

mobile application for changing delivery address not working"
"They keept my package for custom, they had all the papers even I send them again, and those Fu*kers send it back to sender. Biggest s**t company ever. Never recommend that s**t."
"A UPS driver lied that he had made two attempts to deliver my parcel. I work from home and I'm positive that nobody called via the intercom, nobody called me on the phone, and I didn't receive any notice. I had to call the customer service and now will need to go and pick up the parcel myself. It's going to take an hour out of my life. I'll never use their poor services again."
"I am an author who paid $105.00 to ensure a timely delivery for my books to sell at an art sale. Not only was my shipment misrouted by UPS, but they were sent to a UPS facility that a) no one could tell me the location of and 2) customer service representatives claimed was closed for the weekend. My books did NOT arrive in time for the sale--in fact, I am still waiting for my books at the time of this writing--and I lost money because I could not sell the books that I paid in all honesty too much money to not have. I asked for a refund but was told that the company that arranged the shipment is who has to ask for the refund; even though I am the one who paid for the order! I am disgusted by the unreliability of service, lack of customer care, and poor resolution options. I was not even afforded the opportunity to pick up my order so that at least I could sell my books and recoup some of my costs. As long as I have other options, I will never use UPS again."
"UPS destroyed a Tonneau cover during shipment from MN to Kalamazoo, MI. The tri-fold hard cover was punctured with a 2-inch diameter hole that went through the outer packaging and two of the three sections. Additional damage was evident to a snap-latch and one bracket."
"Terrible in every way, very high fees and no communication if there is an address difficulty or any difficulty in delivery. Agents are unhelpful and don't understand questions, they say the same response over and over ""sorry but we can't do anything"". I had to call 3 times to hopefully get m,y package delivered to the correct address and their fees were over $30 after I already paid for shipping, duty and taxes were only $16. I would never ship or receive anything from UPS again, even DHL is better and that's saying something."
Driver/helper smashed Christmas decoration while delivering packages to front door.
"My package was already delayed by a week so when I saw that it was due to be delivered today I made some last minute arrangements so that I could work from home and accept it when it arrived. The doorbell rang mid-afternoon (which is later than when UPS typically deliver to my area) so I opened the main door of the building through the intercom and proceeded to wait at the door of my flat. Turns out the driver had other ideas, as he had already driven off after leaving a not-at-home notice in my mailbox telling me that I can collect my package from some random UPS delivery point miles away from where I live. There are at least two that are closer.

I called customer services straight away and they assured me that my package would be delivered at my home address the next day. I even received e-mail confirmation of the rescheduling. However, according to the app my parcel is waiting for me to collect it from the service point.

UPS has the dodgiest drivers around. Avoid them if you can."
"If I could give 0 stars I would
Utterly useless, it took them 9 weeks to finally deliver my item, it was the 3rd one that eventually reached me!
The first was returned to the merchant (Philips), the second was 'lost'.
When I called, they offered for me to start a claim, which I did. It takes 8 working days to investigate and provide an answer they said. I just logged into my account - it's been 8 working days - and there is no record of my claim!
They lose items and they lose claims if they lose an item.
Utterly useless. Do not use!"
"A parcel that requires a signature was supposed to be delivered today. Instead UPS was lazy and didn't even knock on the door. I heard my dog barking and checked outside just in time to see the UPS truck pulling out of the driveway. I opened the door and there was a sticky note stating, ""No one was home."" Untrue statement. My vehicle was in the driveway and UPS couldn't be bothered to properly do the job they get paychecks for. It's not difficult to knock. Lazy and careless. The phone call to ""customer service"" was useless. She carelessly stated the driver would ""try again tomorrow."" Absolutely nothing was done about this. I signed the note and wrote under it, ""Driver did not knock. I was home."" I doubt anything gets done. The driver will likely toss the signed note in the garbage. Too bad no one is held accountable for anything anymore these days."
"I hate Ups I don't understand why they won't leave my package where tf I told them. I have to keep calling, I have to sign into this sign into that. This shxt is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!"
I’m upset that I had to even check one star. If I could have put 0 I would.UPS absolutely sucks. UPS employees with keep your packages for themselves or take it to the wrong house and nothing is done about it. They say you will get a call back from a manager and the manager says call the company you ordered from and they will give you your money back. I think that’s so unfair. Managers there show no signs of Sympathy. I hate this company and feel like something needs to be done they can’t just keep getting away with this. I never had this problem out of FedEx so far.
"I keep calling their office in casablanca and nobody answers
This is company should be locked"
"I am in a wheelchair and notes posted to put all deliveries and PICKUP packages ""INSIDE THE SCREEN DOOR"" but Ups drivers just THROW PACKAGES AGAINST MY DOOR. This makes retrieving my items VERY DIFFICULT!!!!

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE POSTED NOTES!!!!!"
"This review is in direct response to the UPS service hub, dispatch center, and repulsive Driver “Amid “ who urinated on my box because he is an evil and nasty driver who has a little man complex! This center is located northern VA (phone# 703.342.1518). After my many documented complaints against the driver, UPS could care less. They sent me a lacking 12 word response asking me to call the HUB manager, THAT NEVER called me back after four request! Shame on UPS. This is my complaint below that I sent to them:

“Your straight to the point message could have at least included a simple hello, given the poor way my many complaints have been handled from your local ups HUB. After many complaints and encountering unpleasantness and zero urgency. I should not have to keep calling and dealing with lies, incompetency to handle the matter, and crappy attitudes. I guess UPS IS OKAY WITH THEIR DRIVERS TAKING PERSONAL VENDETTAS out on customers by urinating on packages and stealing letters and other damages. Which all started after my initial complaint. I was told that driver AMID WOULD BE TAKEN OFF of my route deliveries which was a lie. If this is the way you respond to customers who have valid concerns, then shame on you and UPS. It's clear that you condone drivers who urinate on packages which is a health concern but also degrading and despicable. Considering that AMID was aware of previous complaints, there is no way he should have delivered a soaking wet package that smelled like urine. He should have made his HUB AWARE of the package being damaged and had some reach me about the status. You people clearly don't care. I will be filing another complaint because this customer center, and managers, lack serious people skills and exemplifies zero standards. Again, please remove this person from my route because he has shown he has zero control mentally and professionally and this is a storm in the making which you will be responsible.”

UPS has zero ethics and is completely disgusting!"
Parcel thrown into cattle shed despite the house being adjacent to the shed and the fact that I was at home
"Horrible service. I ask them for home delivery. I also answered their SMS confirming home delivery and called them, just to be sure they deliver to right place. Instead of my home, they delivered parcel to access point far away from my home. This will be a problem because I am 70 years old and parcel is 15 kg."
Terrible Terrible Terrible !!! Always Losing Packages Never Returning Money !
"I have several packages from different companies, and they have all been just sitting in different locations for days now. No movement for multiple days. One package was listed at being in one city, moved to another state, and it now says its back at the previous facility. Either they're incompetent, or their reporting system is faulty. I wish companies would stop shipping my packages with UPS, because they're awful. FedEx has been delivering packages just fine, I don't know why UPS has become so terrible."
"The manager fires homeless people at UPS
3480 e ontario ca 91761"
Disgusting company. Good luck talking to a human being without entering a UPS store.
"I have had two packages delivered to the wrong address or lost in one week. Customer Service is of no help! They offer inconsistent solutions to deliver issues. Several times per month (package delivery), my packages land on my neighbors doorstep. My address is prominently posted on my house twice but this does not seem to help. The deliver drivers just drop packages anywhere without looking to see if the address is correct. The service is lacking in quality control and has been undependable. Meantime I am not getting many packages and wasting a lot of time trying to figure out who received them. Not good!!"
"RACKET! DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. MAKES MONEY ON MAKING UP DUTY FEES THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET BACK. I am still waiting for a refund wich I was promised on the 19th of october, and a the 15th of November . It's now DECEMBER and I can't see any trace of my refund for duty fees I was wrongly charged for (personal effects.) Your practices are illegal, unloyal and unfair.

"Absolutely useless delivery service. Asked them to deliver after 10am but they intentionally came twice early in the morning and then send my package back to sender
Avoid!"
I'd ordered flowers for my sister's birthday. They were supposed to be delivered today. She did not receive them. I called the flower company to confirm the address. I gave more directions. According to a UPS tracking number the flowers were delivered. Maybe they went to a different address. Maybe they weren't delivered at all. I personally never use UPS. I use the Pistal Service. At least then I'll know that my package will get to where it is supposed to go.
"This is the worst thing ever, dealing with UPS when you getting packages with them. With them, they don't know how to bring the packages out. Correctly. They want to say something about my address. And when I told them I fixed the issue, they want me to pick the package up. From the location that is at. I don't have a weight of getting my. I don't understand why UPS wants to do this to customers. It's not right when we get our packages from them. They leave packages outside also too. Yes, they do. I'm not accepting this from. UPS. They are the worst company ever, really the worst company ever."
"The worst delivery company in the Netherlands. Might be ok in other countries but if you have the option, don't pick them for NL deliveries."
"What would be really helpful for their company is if they actually showed up at the times they said they will. Said my package would be here between 1-5pm. Requires a signature so I had to take off work to be home. At 1 pm they changed it to be delivered by 9pm. Then at 4pm they changed it to be delivered next Tuesday between 1-5pm. Customer service is a joke. You never get to speak to a live representative, just their damn robot that obviously can't understand shipping numbers no matter how slowly you speak and how clearly you annunciate. Save your time and go to FedEx. I will never use this company again."
"An extremely inconsiderate driver blocked two lanes to make his delivery. I had to wait almost 10 minutes, and if he had pulled over to the curb, I could have continued. I know they have a schedule to maintain, but so does everyone else. They also do their “best” to make sure you cannot contact them - I assume to save customer service from dealing with complaints. I will not use this company."
"I had ordered from Amazon a Chandlier and the carrier was UPS. On 4 occasions, my package has been delayed. Once one instance I had to reorder the same product form Costco as UPS returned the item to the sender.

On another occasion, I had to pick up the package from the distribution center, due to delay and reschedule, as I needed the item before Thanksgiving.

Please never sign up for ""My Choice UPS"" as by default, the alternate preference, which is an Access point, and is taken as the preferred delivery.

In summary, UPS service ""sucks"" and if the UPS management can contact me if they have any interest in improving customer service."
"This company is very bad to use in anything, my sister sent stuff international, and she spend a lot of money so i can get this in 5 to 7 business day can you believe is going to 2 weeks i haven't receive my package? And i need what inside is ugent. i cant believe this. My friend that sent his through FedEx just receive hers within 5 days. This is a bad company and their customer service is horrible also."
"The worst service of my life. I paid extra to have my package sent the next day, which did not happen. I was told to go to Vantaa to pick up my package and they couldn't find it, it's surreal. Please reconsider if you are planning to deliver something by UPS, the service is a disaster. I wish the rating could be set to 0 stars."
"Rude customer service and refuse to help, they needs to treat customer nice rather than being so rude."
"The only reason I'm giving a single star is that 0 wasn't an option.
The goods are not delivered at the specified time. Change delivery days.
It is impossible to schedule normal work. Gives one date, then changes. When you call the support service, you get different information every time, you can't tell when the package will be delivered. Absolutely terrible service. Does not respond to e-mail complaints. Communication 0."
"I paid for overnight delivery and UPS kept moving the delivery date and time. My package was time critical and required a signature for delivery. I had to keep cancelling appointments that cost me additional money in order to try and meet the delivery time UPS gave.

UPS slipped the delivery date by two days and kept moving the time later and later. When I called customer service all they had was platitudes.

Absolutely horrible service. I will never use UPS again."
"They only provide 5 narrow topics to choose from when you call or write. If your issue falls outside of those 5 narrow topics, good luck getting in touch with anyone. They automatically hang up the call if you don't provide a tracking number and if your issue doesn't fit one of the narrow categories.

I was calling to help them and cancel a claim I filed. It was impossible to get through!

Sending you through a serious of AI/digital menus and then hanging up on you? Come on UPS. You can do better."
"It’s so bad that they should be ashamed. Ordered a pair of boots that should have arrived on the 30th of november, as on the 1st of december they hadn’t arrived yet i checked the info status i saw they they wrote somethin like “the receiver is not enlisted in the building” (it wasn’t even clear right away tbh)… like seriously?! The address was correct, ive received tousands of packages from different providers. They simply must have inserted wrongly the address on the maps, and they never even reached out! It was impossible for me to “Change” the address as they wanted me to indepentely on the site, so I had to call. OF COURSE the automatic voice didn’t understand the shippping code after 5 times. When i finally talked to a real human he promised me I would receive my package the day afterwards (2nd lf december)… on the evening I received the mail saying the package is meant to come IN A WEEK ON THE 9TH. It’s ridiculously bad honestly. Then, two hours later I receive an email with a new estimated date (The 5th0. I’m so confused. They make it even difficult for me to wanna purchase from the same online shop to be honest."
"Simple: They claim they tried to deliver my package. Lies. Me and my girlfriend are freelancers and work at home. They didn't even bother. Good luck trying to be deceptive, UPS scum. Its not the first time, nor the second!"
"Completely unreliable. Their estimations are never accurate, customer service is very hard to reach and they are very rude. Regular post would be much cheaper and much more reliable"
"I ordered a eye pencil from Macys on 11/25 and I still haven’t gotten my package. It’s showing as being at one of their facilities in Tennessee for 2 days.
I called UPS and they said Macys did not give them the package until the 30th of November which a flat out lie!!! It is not possible for the package to have shown up at a facility if Macys had not shipped it yet.
I hate UPS!!!!!"
Shamelful. Had to go through the company I bought the rug from to sort a delivery date - TODAY. One message saying it will arrive BEFORE END OF DAY next DEVIVERY DATE WILL BE PROVIDED SOON. Want customers to pay to call to find out what is going on. Other couriers update regularly and provide timeslots but not UPS who think we are here to serve them not the other way around
"This company is a joke, every time they need to delivery a parcel it goes lost. Had three packages to be delivered in those days and all of them got lost."
"Was told it would arrive on 2nd December, arrived a day early when nobody was home and the driver left a 300 euro rug visible in my porch."
"First delivery, wrong address. Not even the same street name, (mine is like 8 letters while the one it was delivered has 4), not even one number in the address is corresponding, and they dare do the delivery for 25 $ for 0.6 pounds!"
"Ups ripped me off again. 9:55pm delivery my a$$!!!!
I hate being forced to deal with these incompetent boobs. I hope this company folds and never comes back."
I advice everyone not to use thiscompany they lose packages and you will never get help or it take months to get a response..I hate UPS
"Ups is garbage!! They have told me for 2 days that my package will be here and has yet to come, all customer service will say is that it will be here today, my wife has missed two days of work cause she has been waiting on this package that no one knows when it will be here! I paid extra money to get it here faster,"
"WARNING!!! DO NOT SHIP ANY HIGH VALUED ITEMS THROUGH UPS. They stole from me at their Dallas, TX facility and UPS does not care. They are aware that theft is a common practice at UPS and do nothing about it. UPS drivers know the high valued packages and take advantages of UPS' flawed delivery system to steal them. UPS is only concern about making money. They have their entire call center in the Philippines and Guatemala so they can get the cheapest labor. These agents are absolutely clueless. According to their website, you can start working at UPS as a package handler in 25 minutes. No wonder UPS has so many thieves working for them. UPS has really gone downhill. UPS you just lost a customer for good. Fedex from now on."
"Soo, I used UPS thinking they would offer a premium service, based on the +$50 I paid compared to other shipping companies. And turns out I just threw $50 in the garbage. There's no customer service, you'll be talking to a stupid auto-reply that will NEVER connect you to a real agent. She'll tell you ""sorry, i didn't catch that"" when you ask for a representative. I wasn't home when they tried the delivery, because they don't give you a time frame. All they say is this day by 9:00pm. Obviously I'm not going to wait at home all day long?? And when I ask to pick up instead of delivery, they asked for $12!! Like I didn't pay enough money for your bad service already????. I am never ever using UPS again, I don't even know how they are still in the business."
This would be the third package that was NOT delivered to my home!!!
"I have used this service twice before, no issues. The third time a package went sent and apparently they will not drop something off if someone isn’t there to receive it. I have never heard of this before. The package doesn’t require a signature so why can it not be dropped off. It has been over a week and I had to call and find out the Information. Now I have to wait until it’s sent back to me, then call and try to get a refund of $40 from me shipping to only ship again with another carrier."
"A warning about using UPS, the worst shipping company on earth that is losing ground everyday. My package was supposed to be delivered on 11/29/22. The driver lied and said that I was not home which is not true. Well the driver chose to leave my package at a UPS pickup point instead of attempting delivery the next day without my consent. On 11/30/22 I went to the designated UPS pickup point and to my surprise the package was not there. I called the customer service who gave me no concrete answer and promised to call me back. Later I got a call from a rude UPS dispatcher called me from (201-372-8840) saying that the package is on its way to the pickup point and I just have to wait. On 12/122, I went to pickup my package again but it was not there again. After spending 45min on the phone, I was told to file a claim and wait !!!!"
"Worst delivery service I have ever encountered. My package had to come 60 miles from their Birmingham depot, to Gloucestershire, so they sent it to Ireland.
They retrieved it and attempted delivery but didn't knock the door or ring the bell and cleared off."
The worse experience you can ever have with a courier
"Conflicting info about whether it would be redelivered or left at a relay spot.
Very hard to contact a human at ups yo confirm things."
if i could give this a 0 i would have. Automated machine was garbage and the humans were not much better. they lost a package that was sent 2 day air for a business. i have gone now 4 days without being able to function and they have a investigation which takes 8 days DO BETTER UPS
"Garbage of a company.
They said attempted delivery but I was home all day.
Then said they attempted twice but obviously a lie!
So no I need to go out my way to collect from a drop off point. Not happy at all"
"At 10:16am I called UPS and got a very rude and disrespectful customer service who constantly argues an refuse to provide a supervisor or manager stating that non his available. He refuses to provide his name and was being very sarcastic and bullying. I have used UPS and this level of customer service is beyond me. On several I kept telling him my name and he constantly saying mom even though I told him my name and asked him to address me by name. I told him, I hope to God this conversation is being recorded because his customer skill need improvement. He responded, I don’t care."
"As an artist in Germany who runs a small business, it's difficult to get good shipping service, but not with UPS Germany! I missed an express window today due to transport being delayed in my area, went to schedule a pickup AFTER 12h deadline passed, and the driver came in 20 minutes!

98% of the time the service is better than promised (for eg. faster international expedited and express shipping). 2% of the time life happens (driver doesn't make it due to volume or there's a delay in air freight), and that's completely understandable.

Context: I live near a forest, there are no UPS access points I can walk to, no public transport, no Uber and I don't drive. But UPS does everything they can to provide the service. Like a magic shipping fairy for 3 years in a row. Thank you!"
"I ordered some christmas presents that were supposed to arrive yesterday (30th nov 2022) through UPS. On the original site I had put my address in no problem, all good. UPS gets my parcel and says my address doesn't exist and that they are trying to fix the issue. I see that instead of Flat 1, Street Address, they've labelled my address as Flat 1## Street Address, which no, definitely does not exist. This of course turned into my problem to resolve, I tried calling several times (after having to google the phone number since the site is useless and wants to try to put people off calling as much as they can and doesn't direct you to a phone number) and my call was either not put through or declined, I emailed and have no automated response so who knows if it went through, I made an account on UPS to update my address but the form wouldn't allow me to put my surname in so I couldn't update the address, on the tracking form it said I needed to update my address so I clicked the link and it said that my parcel wasn't eligible to change details. I've had to ask for it to be delivered to a pick-up point and since it's several kilos I'll have to pay to get a taxi to get it home when I could have just stayed in for the delivery as I had planned. I've never had this problem with any other delivery before, and I don't understand how UPS's error is my fault and responsibility. Absolutely ridiculous service. I never write reviews for companies but this has frustrated me to no end."
Worst Shipping company in the world with the worst staff and the worst attitude towards customer services and packages safety. 1 star is too much for their incompetence.
"So UPS is never my choice, in fact i often do not buy if UPS is the only shipper but sometimes have no other options, yesterday for the third time in a row the same driver shows up at my place late in the day with a busted payment machine telling me ''online online only'' as he can't process the exorbitant fees i only get with UPS from a US purchase, i took the day off waiting for him as you never know when he will show up and my purchase was expensive and company info was all over the box so did not want it on the porch all day, i did actually try the online payment in the morning and every single time some error occurred, in the end i once again watched this incompetent fool drive away with my package after waiting for my item all day, 3 separate deliveries in a row now with this terrible company and have advised seller that i want a refund and will try and find what i want elsewhere but with the holidays it will take weeks if not months.. all because of UPS who sends out drivers with busted machines or this incompetent driver who might not know how to use it but i am the only one losing out on time and money, he or they don't give a dammed, never happens with any other shipper except for UPS.. the worst"
"Gave me three different times but never came. They don't call or send any notification before coming. And help service lie about times, I will never use their service again."
"Could not be worse.
It was almost laughable how bad the service is. They lost a package after a week of stating it was going to be delivered, day after day. When they finally admitted they had lost the package - the claim form does not work!"
"One of the worst logistics company. Whenever I order something costly from Costco online, my parcel always get lost. They fake the delivery. I get delivery notifications and no real delivery happens. I had to prove the case with my ring videos all the time. I wish you get out of business instead of cheating your customers"
"The absolute worst company to communicate with.
You cannot get in touch with the specific hub that process deliveries to your address. You must call a 1800 number that is useless. So frustrating. There is a total disregard for the consumer especially being the receiver of a package."
"My entire interaction with UPS has been one problem after another. I ordered a birth certificate for my son and paid for next day shipping because it was urgent. The package ended up being posted as delivered but the person who signed for it was not me. I filed a claim to look for the lost package. After a week of waiting with nothing, I contacted them again and was promised an answer by end of day. Nothing. I called again before closing and they said I would hear the next day. Again nothing. This is already 8 days after I had first filed the claim. Finally, in desperation, I ordered the certificate and spent another $77 to have it urgently shipped out. Because of the delay, I will probably need to pay even more to get it shipped overseas again. Then 10 days after my URGENT package was supposed to arrive, I get an email from the housing office where I live saying they have a package for me. Turns out UPS was not delivering at the housing block because of some strike going on. I was NEVER informed about this by UPS. They never mentioned this in any of my many interactions with them. They never got back to me. I found today the case is closed because I ended up solving it myself. I am now out a lot of money plus stress in preparing documentation for a trip. I will NEVER use UPS as a delivery system again. FedEx and Amazon have been faithfully making deliveries this whole time. UPS is a disaster. I am left out lots of money and time!"
"UPS are the worst delivery company in us!
thieves, they steal your order and then they tell you file a claim even if you do you will never get anything. UPS just west of money and time.
i don't recommend UPS"
The worst experience I ever had with a courier. The whole system is totally wrong designed. One week I cant take my delivery.
"Too bad 0 stars aren't an option!!!
UPS temporarily loses our package for which we paid the Worldwide Express Plus fee to be delivered 4 days later. An investigation is started and after 3 weeks the package is finally delivered. The UPS store confirms that we're entitled to a full refund. Next thing you know, UPS voids the refund without any reason. When you call customer service the - very difficult to understand - representative tells you that the investigation is closed and that she doesn't have any other information to give you. Really, that's it??? Shame on you UPS for stealing from your customers!!!"
"UPS sucks!! They lost my 2 day delivery pkg and lied to cover their ass. If I won't have followed up a week  later, they would ignore everything. Customer service is clueless. Management sucks and deliver BS only!! They take no responsibilities nor accountabilities!!. Management has no sense of urgency nor empathy for customers. They lost my sensitive pkg and they act like I have to wait for 2 weeks until they can give me any type pf feedback.  By this pkg being lost I lost a major opportunity because of the content of pkg and it can not reproduce it.

This whole UPS management are bunch of worthless professionals that are not right for the job, just collecting paycheck. Which tells me a lot about UPS corrupt culture that is mismanaged from Top to bottom!!!."
By far THE worst business I've ever dealt with. Playing to see by their 1.2 rating. Good luck with this worthless place!
The only reason I'm giving a single star is because 0 wasn't an option. Their customer service automation system is garbage. Says my package was delivered but it wasn't. Tried opening a claim online and it said it was unable to due to it being transferred to USPS. Wth??????? I need to know where my $260 package is and WHY it wasn't delivered via UPS despite it saying it was left at my mailbox by UPS. ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT.
"I have 2 experiences with UPS, the first time they delivered my package to the wrong address and put the attempted delivery note in a mail box with a name that does not even slightly resemble mine.

They started the day out by sending me an email that told me that the package would arrive tomorrow instead of today. But I just received an email that they have ""tried"" to deliver my package, no one has rung my bell all day, and I've been at home. They then delivered the package to a package shop that was never presented to me as an option.

All in all, I have no idea how their business works or how this is alright to them. But I am decidedly NEVER using them as a delivery option again."
My package was supposedly lost but was at facility on two occasions but can’t be found and it’s a purchase that can’t be bought again ! Really ruined my holidays! Forget a refund I want my package
Ordered a house warming gift from e bay due to be delivered 29/9 received an e mail stating it was delivered which was a surprise as I was home all day and had no one knock at my door. Raised this and ups came back after an investigation stating this had been delivered an no further assistance provided. I thought UPS was a reputable company but looking at the reviews I now know to steer clear of any company that uses them as I do not want to be further out of pocket.
"If ever you want free stress then send a shipment with this company, Just shipped my clothes from Nigeria to South Africa, its as if I shipped banned substances, it has been from one receipt to the other back and forth with a bunch of customer service that has no clue of what is going on. I have been waiting for 3 weeks for an express shipment that is paid exorbitant amount. I am so annoyed, please don't use them"
The company has lost a suitcase which contained all of my possessions several weeks ago. It has not compensated me and refuses to help.
"I have unfortunately had UPS in control of my parcels on two separate occasions. Both of which have been frustrating and stressful. They don't send updates even though I signed up to the app. Their tracking is not updated so you never know if or when your parcel is likely to turn up. I eventually requested the last parcel was sent to a local drop off point, as they couldn't seem to follow simple instructions at my address, but then after they acknowledged my request they ignored it and sent the parcel to the original address! Now I guess I was lucky enough to eventually get my items but these guys are completely incapable of doing a simple job that most other delivery company's manage all the time without all the crap that these clowns bring with them. I am very unlikely to order from the company I used as long as they continue to use UPS. Which is a real shame."
Absolutely horrible service. W T F happened to their service ?? Several- several- many times now that we’ve used UPS have caused us to lose business . Friends and good will. We will NEVER use UPS Again. So saddened by their “ don’t care about you “ service.
"Awful experience! I am shocked that UPS has been this unprofessional! I ordered a couch 2 months ago and it was shipped to my previous address. I trued staying there all day to wait on it, even left the driver a note. They shipped it back to the seller. I ordered it again. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, but the driver never came, then it was today, but he never showed up. I had to open a claim and file a complaint with amazon. I signed up for ups.com and paid 20$ extra for the my choice selection, and lo and behold—it was a crock of crap! You can’t change the address without the info notice number, and the delivery drivers for Hattiesburg areas do not leave the notices for an attempted delivery, so I don’t know if they really attempted or if they are too lazy to do their job and deliver 4 boxes at 69lb. Each. How does a large item like this become a miss? Ridiculous! I prefer fedex, hands down, over ups for sure!"
"Bad experience with service 1(800) PICK-UPS is no longer the best. Lousy customer service, a 3rd party they are unfamiliar with the system."
"Paid top dollar for overnight shipping, took 3 days to send 150 miles. Idiotic. Also lost a valuable light fixture and other items."
No attempt from driver to try to reach someone before leaving a note and rescheduling the delivery. I was literally there waiting for the package and didn't hear any signs of a delivery attempt to get signature (which was never informed I would need until after the failed attempt) I can see why UPS hS the most terrible reviews
"I paid for overnight service and the tracking information confirms it, however, it took over a week to deliver...ground service would have been quicker.

I called to complain, but they said they could not refund me because I did not pay them directly...OF COURSE NOT! We normally pay the vendor, but the vendor did their part by shipping overnight (as per the tracking info). I called the vendor so they could request a refund and they said they will just refund me themselves because they don't want to deal with them...I told them not to reimburse me because it was not their fault, but to be cautious of how they cheat people by charging O/N, but delivering slower than snail mail.

Basically, UPS can do whatever they want, cheat you and get away with it...that's gotta stop!"
Very bad carrier have not received packet..and customer service is bad.
Was very pleased with my delivery. They did what I asked.
"The worst!Driver did not attempt any delivery I had paid extra the Seller£9,for home delivery.
My order was delivered to a Wine Cellar,UPS tracking entries are misleading ,inacurate and inconsistant.
UPS never contact me and falsy indicated that attempted delivery.
BEWARE!"
Worst customer service ever. Getting someone on the phone took over an hour. They took $70 to overnight a package and my package was received 5 days later. NO ONE CARES!!!!!
"To describe UPS service. I can't because the English words are not strong enough to describe this pathetic 'courier service' .Worst delivery service ever! I still don't know where my parcel is. Even after 10 business days completed still the parcel is undelivered.Their reps are telling me it's at the warehouse, because of weather event impacted UPS services, although your location may not be impacted but the movement of parcels in the network may be impacted worst service. Why don't you guys closed the company? When you are not capable of rendering proper service shame on you UPS. Shipment from India 18/11/2022 today is 29/11/2022 yet not received."
"I used to use UPS regularly to post fishing rods in a tube over 150cm as they were the most competitive courier at around £17.
Like many couriers they charge a large handling fee at £8.50 which is horrendous but all of a sudden they imposed a peak rate levy of £5.91 on top.
I challenged them why am I being charged this as I didn't ask for Saturday delivery or any express service but all they said was it's stated on their website which didn't answer my question.
For a parcel qoute to go from £17 to over £24 in a week is extortionate and sadly UPS doesn't seem to care less at losing your custom."
"I ordered winter hat from Canada as present for my relative. UPS demand £50 as duty on top of price. I paid. Then UPS said that the driver cannot deliver to our address.
In the end of the story the driver suddenly found our address at Sunday Morning ONE MONTH after, when with order we pay for delivery in 48 hours and the duty UPS demanded. So this bad services that it is look like crooks and extortionist. Be aware of them."
"Appaling fee structure. End up paying unreasonably much for handling the import tax.
Thieves."
"Claims must be submitted within 30 days after shipment. However if the shipment is delayed and gets marked as ""lost"" only after that time period, they can basically steal your package without having to refund you. Not saying they did that, but it's a possibility. And I lost >1100 USD due to that rule"
"I cant give this company 0 stars so I will leave 1. They lie about their attempts at delivering your packages. They lie about the whereabouts and delivery dates for your packages. Their service is overall disgusting and unprofessional. I cant even connect my tracking numbers to the UPS account that I created after experiencing a disaster of a delivery for my AirPod Pros.. which I never received after they ""attempted multiple times"" to deliver them. May I mention that there was never a note left as proof of their attempts. Any company that uses UPS as a carrier for their packages and products will not be receiving my money."
"Well, this would be the 10th time in the past 6 months I'd say that my packages were supposedly delivered but not actually delivered. And another 4 times I'd say they were delivered to another address. Or the packages just disappear. This is beyond ridiculous. Look at all your one star reviews you have. Hire people that can deliver packages at the right home."
"We have been in business at our location since 1974 we have always enjoyed dealing with ups until today it's been the most horrible experience we have ever experienced and we will most likely sever Ties and instruct our vendors to use a different method of shipping my company's we have been waiting for products for over 10 days received nothing and to find out today they tried to deliver 3 different times and no one was there which was totally untrue today we found out the driver tried again to deliver our freight only to find out no one there well we were there 10to4 and the 3rd attempt was made at 230pm obviously untrue we called customer service 6 times finally spoke to someone that understood English were expecting a phone call from harrington Delaware which we had 3 different times around 515pm never a call we r DAVS its hard for us to get around they want us to drive 3 hours round trip to pick boxes up they never tried to deliver we have a big sign on our door if after hours please leave in front which has always worked for us for years I don't know where our regular driver is but he would never ever put us through this horrible experience
Happy holidays to all

If I could have given them no stars I would have. I mailed a package to my son It was scanned delivered at 3:14 at 3:15 he walked out the door there was no package there was no UPS truck so I contacted them immediately because I had been tracking this package for days. So when I got the alert I sent him straight out the door. They told me that they would escalate this issue and filing investigation well that was on Friday here it is Monday and I have not received an email I have not received a phone call so I had to call the 800 number back The gentleman tells me that he is so sorry but it seems like my issue was dropped between the cracks but he would assure me someone would contact me back in an hour. An hour goes by and the Odessa office contacted me back and let me know that my package was GPS tracked and it was scanned delivery in that vicinity. Not yes it was scanned at the correct location It was scanned in in the vicinity and sends me to the 800 number once again where I find out no claim has been filed on my package which I was told it would be on Friday. So today I file a claim Wait to see if I get an email and then I'm told I have to wait 8 days to see if this issue gets resolved. And I have a feeling in a days I will be calling them back again and no claim would have been filed and I will have to do this all over again because the customer service at UPS is horrible It is a joke. Do not use this service It's worthless
"I would give zero star if possible. Worst customer service, their people are not trained properly and after 3 months and weekly follow up calls and constant misleading information, my claim has still not been processed."
Had to drop off a package that needed to be returned to Amazon. I walked in and the store was very clean and the personnel were very quick and efficient. Best UPS I have been to so far.
"Three days of confusion waiting for a Lightwriter speech machine to arrive for my wife and to pick up a faulty one. Still waiting despite contacting them. Conflicting and missed delivery times, difficulty hearing and understanding customer service response to concerns. Confusing messages about delivery times. Still none the wiser about receiving this essential item. Pathetic company. If you have a choice avoid them!"
"UPS dosent care about gheir employees... I informed them i had not been asleep for 27 hours due to working UPS friday morning noveember 25th 2022 , working my 2nd and not getting off 2nd job until 12am November 26th then having to be at UPS at 2am that same day... they trued to force me to work 2nd sort knowing i had not slept in about 27 hours.."
"Package delivery delayed with no update. Signature required, so naturally take off work because expense of said package. Call to see why it was delayed get a very poor explanation. Followed by being hung up on."
"WARNING!!!
DO NOT SEND ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS TO MEXICO. THEY ARE LAME RESPONDING AND HELPING GETTING THROUGH SOOO MUCH RED TAPE.
IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE TO GET MY PACKAGES DELIVERED.
DO NOT FALL IN TGE TRAP OF BEING Q CHEAPER SERVICE. I THIBK THEY MAYBE CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY ARE SOOO BAD!"
"My experience with ups 49415 area code is 3 different drivers all superlative… please as the union renegotiate contracts give this area significant monetary recognition thank you as they earned it pat palazzolo 49415
Plz consider a one time bonus too thx"
"The worst company ever UPS they tried to deliver my package, but I never see it an update I do not recommend UPS they sucks big-time worst 2022 company upstairs 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
As per usual could not be bothered to come down farm track drive. Left my £180 coat hanging from a gate. UPS used to leave my medical supplies on the road and on one occasion when I saw the delivery man and asked him to deliver to the house he told me to f*** off.
"UPS is saying they delivered a package (with an expensive item) and it is no where to be found. We checked immediately and nothing is there. They either dropped off at the wrong house (where it was then stolen because we checked our neighbor's porches), did not actually deliver it, or stole it themselves. UPS responded that we should wait 48 hours and the package may show up. Their drivers don't take a photo of having made the delivery so we have no proof they even dropped it off. Why allow your drivers to say a package is delivered and then give 48 hours to wait? I need to remember to always make the effort to check who the carrier will be for an important package. UPS is awful."
"USELESS

Really bad experience, was not my choice...."
UPS says they delivered a package to my front door but when I open my door no package was to be found anywhere. I called the toll free number and was told it was handed over to my local post office which is a total BS because when its handed off or transferred to the local USPS there is a different tracking number from the postal office and in fact United Parcel says it was delivered directly at my front door per tracking number on the UPS website..What a bunch of lying low lives. This is not the first time either that even my neighbors have had the same problem.Yes I realize people steal packages but I was home the same time as the fake delivery notice and no package.Liar Liar Liars
"This has to be the worst company I have ever dealt with I am now at day 12 and have been asking for information required to claim back duty for items returned from the UK. Customer services non-existent on the phone you ring the UK and someone from the states after a 30-minute wait answers the phone they cannot help contact support via email nothing ring again waiting for support again in the states try this email address waited 2 days to be told they cannot help, try this email address they are not the right department contact customer services billing again phone not answered.

Disgraceful service

Andrew Found"
I had equipment to return to work on Friday. I don't have a printer so I drove to town to print the labels and ship the packages. I went to 4 UPS locations I called and spoke to 3 UPS employees. 2 of those employees called 2 of the locations to see if they could print my labels. Apparently they lied as none of the four places could. The reps in these locations said they never got a call. After 3 failed attempts I stopped hauling the computer equipment into the buildings. And that's when someone tried to steal the equipment out of my car. Thank you UPS employees for screwing up my car and my insurance with a claim. I never did get the labels printed or the packages shipped. I will be advising my work how terrible you made it for me to return that equipment. Since I am a previous Purolator employee I will be advising them to switch shipping companies.
Ups says they can't come down my driveway cause they are not allowed to back up over 10 foot when there is plenty of room to turn. The lady at the customer service was rude.My package is beyond late.They lied and said they made 2 attempts to deliver and they haven't. I still haven't received my package at this point idk if I will or not. I will not be using ups anymore. I will find an alternative!
Horrible service at UPS. Our package was randomly dropped at another location. Not even close to our address. No way to provide complaints. I will now avoid any company doing business with UPS.
"Very frustrated with their service. It happened to me 3 times that the ups guy never come, but always show attempt when I track online, and then they send the package back to the sender. Such a liar."
0 STARS The delivery service is the worst ever!!!!!
Why are UPS drivers allowed to get away with stealing your packages? UPS said my package was delivered on November 23rd but it’s nowhere to be found. They said it was delivered to my address?
"Don’t go anywhere near this company! I ordered some expensive toiletries from a Swedish company and if I’d known they use UPS I would never have ordered them. As usual, my order has not arrived - they lie in their email saying they have made 2 attempts to deliver my parcel. They haven’t."
"I had a package to be delivered next business day and I was not home to sign for the package instead of trying to redeliver the package the NEXT day the driver sent it to an annex about 2 hours away I will never use UPS again if I buy something and it can only be shipped through UPS I will not buy the item if I have to get an item replaced and it has to be shipped through the ups I will take the loss and not use UPS. This year when I ship out my Christmas packages to my family members all over the United States I will not be using UPS now This is Bs instead of paying extra to get my item the next day I paid extra just to have to wait 3-5days, if you feel like wasting money use the UPS."
Delivered promptly. Concerned driver was going to leave it in full view by the front door beforeU got to it
"What a sorry delivery service! Bunch of thieves and liars! Drivers say they tried to deliver and never stop. My car was gone, door wide open, and two people home and they never stopped! You pay more money than ever and get less! This is the third time this has happen! Heads need to roll!"
"First they said that I would be notified when they were in the delivery route. The delivery date was for the 30th of this month. Finally I get a delivered notice, I go outside and there's nothing there! This always happens with UPS. I'm 76yrs old and I can't be hunting for a package!!!😡"
"Been lied to over and over again with UPS. I was told all day my package was on the truck for delivery and that was not the case. Here it is 10:00 on a Friday night and now I'm being told it will be Monday before I receive my package. I had this package sent overnight and that was 3 days ago.
I would think the number 1 thing in customer service would be to give your customers truth. It's not hard telling the truth. Here I am setting Here for 3 days without my medication that I need to survive and all I get is lies lies and more lies."
I’ve had never had a problem with getting a package. They said it was strep to deliver a package on two separate days. A notification has been left. There was someone there at both times and have not seen no notification. I asked if the phone can be left at the store. They say the sender has that restricted you talk to the sender they said it’s not true would need to talk to the representative at UPS. This is crazy
"UPS said ""We’re very sorry your delivery is late. If you have not received your package by November 30, you can come back here the next day for a refund.""
I have been ordering my package on 11/17/22, now it’s 11/25/22 i don’t received any my package yet. This company is a BIG trash company in the world. I want my package now. I will never chose this big trash company again to delivery my package. I’m so mad at this trash company. Example if I ordered today, I want my package arrive tomorrow. I want my package come fast. Not very late."
"If I could give zero I would.

I live in Montreal and this happed to me a second time. Been home waiting for my package all day. Wait for a phone call. When I got to the website it says they tried to reach men. BS, even if you did not have my phone number, I provided the apartment numbers so call me through the interphone! No they are lazy and didn’t even bother to get out the truck. I don’t even think they got to my apartment complex. If you’re baying something make sure the company doesn’t give your pack through UPS. Just go and see if the company has a store at Amazon, at least Amazon workers know how to do their job."
Where in the hell are my packages! Two orders back to back and didn't get none of them. First time you dropped my package off to someone else and the second time it's lost in transit. I'm actually scared to have anything shipped through you people again.
I payed for 2day air been 4 days and still no package! Why in hell did I pay for 2day air if you people can't do their damn job!
I cannot believe UPS would leave a parcel worth hundreds of pounds outside. Made no effort to deliver and had the nerve to say ‘left inside porch’. I have no porch… it was left outside and thankfully a neighbour spotted it and took it in… grrrr…
Incompetents. Not professional.
"The delivery guy never called or rang the building's bell for that matter. I receive on the same day messages from UPS via email that I wasn't available, even though there was always someone in the house! Liars and worst of the worst"
"They claim to be a delivery company but are the worst at delivering packages. I always have issues with every single package I get sent through them. Every time I need help, their customer service does absolutely nothing. I've lost packages and lost money that I can never get back because of how terrible UPS is. PLEASE stick with USPS or FedEx. Those are much more reliable, from my experience."
"Terrible. Every time I've dealt with them was a nightmare. They screwed everything up multiple times, amazing."
Very efficient and more than satisfactory experience with UPS. They communicate well.
"Welcome to UPS Casablanca. I was to receive a package worth 310€.
The tax applicable in Morocco is 2.5% on electronic devices. So for my package €7.75.
UPS finally asked me to pay this famous tax plus handling fees ect which I will list here:
- 76€ application fee
- 15€ fund advance fee
- 39€ for the original document good to deliver
If no payment has arrived within 5 days:
- 0.27€ per day of storage with a minimum of 22€
After 16 days:
0.35€ per day
It is not finished. Between 15 and 45 days:
- €27 application fee
Beyond 45 days:
- 78€ administration fee
After 45 days the package automatically becomes the property of UPS.
I asked for the package to be returned to the sender. They asked for a total of 234€ to return the package. I have all the proofs in email invoice ect. I remain at the disposal of trust pilot to provide them. I call it theft, at no time did I sign a contract stipulating that I had to pay these sums. Paying the country's 2.5% tax is normal but what UPS is asking is theft
So finally I will never receive my package and lose 310€. Thanks UPS"
I have been waiting in all day for my parcel to arrive took a day off work so I could sign for it & they don’t even knock? just post a ‘sorry we missed you’ through the door? It would help if you actually did your job right and knock to inform people that are waiting ALL day for their parcels! I have now spent nearly an hour trying to speak to an actual person and not an automated line! Worse delivery service
"very poor service, failed to deliver item. Will not be using their service again in future."
We have a very friendly ups delivery man called Adrian and he deals with the Wirral area. He’s always on time and always so friendly when he comes in. Asks us where we want the parcel. Very lovely man and deserves recognition.
I would give them a -10 stars if it was available. I will never use them even if my life counts on it .
"They didn’t even knock on my door to let me know they have arrived with my parcel, left a note saying “sorry we missed you!” When I called them they just didn’t care the little narcissists! Lied about where it’ll be delivered and they refused to let me speak to a manager! Really angry"
"I ordered a gumball item
From kappa through them they stole my money and don’t let me even report the lost delivery. Very disappointed and worst service ever"
Terrible Terrible Terrible stay away if at all possible
"Worst delivery company ever.
I sent two packages from London to Italy because I moved for few months with my two babies.
I read all the info and I respect the delivery policy. Their website explain you can send your personal belonging and you don’t need to pay any fee if the value is below 35£. I contact the customer service as well before send them and they confirm that.
I fill all the forms 3 times and at the end
I had to pay 70€ otherwise they will destroy all my stuff.
I tried to contact the customer service and they NEVER reply.
I will never use this company and I really hope nobody else will do it. You are a shame!"
"Absolutely disgusting they have become!! 3 days in a row I have been lied too!! Package out for delivery, no package!!! Then I call customer service, & they lie too!! Pulling fedex moves now!!! Weather exception my ass!! They had the package before the storm hit!! Driver shows up Monday, diggs around in the back for a while, comes out, well im supposd to have one for you, but I cant find it seriously...i'll be back either later or tomorrow...what joke they have become!!! Now tomorrow's a holiday, & still no package!! Im beyond pissed off at this point!! I think they lost it, & are full of bs!!! Find someone else to play games with!!😡😡"
Again horrible service package said met customer when it was left a mile from my house between my neighbors and my mailbox. Why is it so hard to deliver it to my house instead of out in the open between mailboxes anyone could take. Hundred of dollars just tossed around. This has been the second package in two weeks why should I support jobs of having my package sent when UPS can’t do there jobs and delivery to the house! I wish I could upload the picture of where and how they left the package.
"If I could give zero stars I would. Hello,

Almost every single package I have received delivered by UPS is damaged. I ordered three orchids from Just Add Ice and when delivered, the delivery person delivered one upside down. All three orchids were severely damaged. Just Add Ice sent me replacements and I just received two of them. I SAW the delivery drive throw down the packages (both on their sides) and one of them has a totally broken stem and all the flowers will now die.

At the same time he THREW DOWN these packages, another delivery from pottery barn was also thrown down by him and the entire package was opened. I have not yet checked to see what was stolen.

I tried to call Customer Service but the computer told me it would not connect me to a live person.

I finally got in touch with customer service on chat and they had the local dispatch call me. They said that they'd talk to the driver, but to also realize that there is a huge warehouse that filters the packages and they could have been damaged that way. And they also said to know that an orchid is fragile and that is likely why it was damaged. So, perhaps UPS should not ship orchids then?

I don't feel confident having any package sent by UPS after these experiences"
Poor customer service. Packages marked as delivered but they actually are not. You cannot get to a customer service representative for help.
"I ordered AirPods through target.com- imagine my surprise when I opened the parcel that had looked like it was a recycled box- the Target tape had been cut through, a new mailing sticker had been made and slapped over the old one and resealed with new clear packaging tape- I find a large toner for what looks like an office sized printer.

Target has been amazing with refunding my money, and I already called and spoke with someone at UPS and she told me there’s an investigation going on. However, I wanted others to be aware."
I would honestly give them 0 stars if I could. Absolutely ridiculous.
"I’m never giving UPS my business ever again. I paid $14.64 in shipping to ship a box of Christmas presents. The delivery driver marked the package as delivered in front of the front door even though immediately after it was marked delivered, my friend opened the door and the package was nowhere to be found. She checked behind plants and her mail box and it was not there. Not only did I lose money on the presents but UPS doesn’t care and wont even refund me in what I paid in shipping."
Bought a new pair of shoes and already paid a delivery fee of 41$. Ups tried to charge me an extra 60$ for a “delivery fee” on top of what I paid than proceeds to try to charge me an extra 35$ for “gst” I got the charges waived however when my package arrived they proceeded to charge me an extra 50$ for them to come to my house and deliver it. I will never use ups again.
"I Guess i should have looked here before attempting to work for UPS. The spam calls, the representative outsourced agents, is maddening."
"Too big to succeed

Ups really really sucks
Can’t think of a positive thing to say

No wonder they wear BROWN"
"If only there were zero stars. They will not deliver at my address because they feel it is unsafe without signature. A marked police car is two houses down, it is one of the safest neighborhoods in my community, and after repeating the tracking number four times and explaining I just want the packages dropped off, I'm told to go to a website and build a custom profile. I will not be using UPS anymore if they can't do any better"
"Terrible customer service - when asking for a refund ensured by UPS's money back guarante, I was told that I would automatically be given a refund within 10 days. However, 10 days passed, and no refund showed up in my bank account (original form of payment) or my UPS account. So I called again to see what was going on, only to be told that it is now too late to file a claim for a delayed package! When I politely explained the situation, all I was told was that it was impossible to file a refund now. No refund given, no credit given, and no discount code for future orders given - it was all ""not possible now"". I regularly spend £150-200 with UPS each month as a small business. While I understand that I am a minescule drop in their massive corporate ocean, they will no longer get my business."
"Lost a package that was properly labeled, was virtually impossible to get a hold of anyone on their 800 number and when I filled out a clam and was approved they gave me less then half the money they had agreed on.
I just don’t get how this company is still in business. I will NEVER use them again.
By the way it’s the second time I’ve dealt with the same issue. I ordered a pair of tire and received a big box of toilet paper instead. Luckily the company I ordered the tires from had to deal with them and not me.
Just unbelievable how crappy this company is. How are they still in business??
Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. They really are not not worth the hassle!!!"
"Worst delivery company, they lie constantly to their customers. Their system says I wasn’t home when I was there all day. Doorbell didn’t ring, no call either - then the tracking system said I requested a new delivery date, which I didn’t do. There is no way to reach anyone. After three failed delivery attempts they sent an email demanding I pick up a package at their depot in the middle of nowhere -not serviced by public transit and a 80 euro taxi each way - or they return to sender. Rotten from the top executives down to their delivery staff. Avoid this company if at all possible."
"I sent a delivery that was supposed to be delivered after 24 hours, its been 72 hours, and the updates on their website are still stuck my parcel is in a warehouse where they can't do any actions, for now, I'm still waiting for my package to arrive until now"
Horrible service!!! Ups site never works just sends you through rigorous circles to track packages. Can't speak to anyone at company!! Shipped the wrong package sent package back then couldn't ship the right package for some reason address never changed!! Don't know why we still using them!! I will never again!! This is not a company that's interested in their customers needs as well as their site and company is very poorly governed & maintained 😓😓
Ordered a parcel on November 7th and today is the 23rd of November and I still did not get it. No one is giving me a reliable reason for the delay! Horrible working experience! Do not recommend this company if you need your parcel on time!!!!
The worst delivery company ever. Even after updating my correct address they had post my parcel to wrong address. They even don’t check who is receiving the parcel. The customer service is so poor. Asked to delivered parcel in Reading . They had delivered at Welling. How annoying is this to be noted? I don’t know why they do delivery if they don’t delivered at correct address😤
"The last two parcels were dropped off at a shop because they said I wasn't at home to receive them this happened over two days.
Utter nonsense I work from home and was at home both times.
Next time I order from a company I will opt for click and collect and not bother paying a delivery fee if they use UPS."
I'm disappointed first off I had 5 items that said delivered and left at front door.. I went out there looked around even checked with my neighbors but it wasn't nowhere to be found....Not only that I also ordered some shoes from Nike for my son and it somehow got lost.. I tried to file a claim but it won't let me and I hate you can't call to complain... I personally feel like these workers is stealing stuff... I got all my stuff I ordered from FedEx just fine...I lost over $200 dollars dealing with the ups....whoever took my stuff is going to pay God sees everything...
Goods ordered two weeks ago still not received
"UPS lost my package and after more than a month they were able to find it and finally deliver it. The problem is they were shipping a part for a vehicle and no one can wait that long so the part was re-ordered again and other methods of shipping were used. Since the time frame for the return was longer than 30 days from the purchase the seller no longer accepts return and with ups you cannot start a clam for unknown reason. As the result you are stuck with a part that you no longer need. And UPS doesn’t care about it at all. Unfortunately, UPS is trash in comparison to other private delivery organizations."
"Worst service ever, they will never notice you when your parcel arrives and what they gonna do, they just change the status of delivery for some bs like ""The receiver was not available for delivery. We'll make a second attempt the next business day."" 0 stars from 5 ."
Ups is by far the worst courier out there. I have had so many issues with this carrier. So many that I have rerouted all of my packages to to an access point(UPS store) and still it makes no difference. No resolution by phone because none of their customer service reps use English as their first language. I try to avoid this carrier at all costs. I either never receive my packages or I have to call in several times for each order to attempt to get my package delivered to where it should be. Worst carrier ever!
Absolutely refuses to get out of the truck and come to the door if a signature is required on a delivery. Simply will not deliver a package that requires a signature. This has been the case with UPS no matter where I've lived. Just a terrible delivery service.
"It took a long time to get hold of anyone to help. The recording kept asking for a tracking number over and over when I did not have one and that was not the issue.

The website for creating label had problems working. I called their tech assistance line. They had a bunch of people who could not speak understandable english in guatemala who could not figure out what the problem was. I called the corporate office and got more of the same - the Phillipines this time - they did not even know the phone number of the corporate office. Ridiculous sham service."
"UPS cannot keep track of packages for the life of them. I've always had issues, never gotten an answer for any questions or tracking notifications I've requested. It's really awful. I literally rather use the actual postal service."
there is a rude man who keeps calling for my boss from the csr department. no reason for him to call. he lied to me told me he was resolving a issue with my boss .. which my boss has not spoken to anyone. he calls daily and is very rude from his number 424-645-6319. very disrespectful to the point my boss is ready for his call to tell him where to go an how fast to get their .
"I ordered something from Amazon, no issues there. UPS on the other hand...nothing but issues. They tried to deliver on Thursday at 11am. But guess what, I work, so obviously I wasn't home to sign for it. Instead of trying at a later time, they opted to try again on Friday. At 11 am. So again, I wasn't home. Then, after getting somewhat irate at their incompetence I was finally able to arrange to have it dropped off at a pick up point. Which it was, at 10am on Monday (4 days after the initial delery attempt.) Which their notification things confirmed. Only it wasn't. Because someone of their end had decided that it needed to be returned to UPS. So at 3pm they called the drop off point and picked it up. At 5:30 pm, I spoke to one of their ""escalation team"" people. She had no idea why it was picked up. Her system showed it as still being at the pick up point. I had to tell her it wasn't. She called them and confirmed that, but with no explanation as to why it was picked up. So today, 6 DAYS after the initial delivery attempt, with no contact from UPS, I still don't have my package. In theory, I should have it today, and a ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" comment from them. My only question is, What if this had been medication, that I needed to live? Would it still be an inconvenience? at ""too bad so sad?"" And ALL of this because they refuse to deliver to residential addresses after 6pm. Refuse to deliver on weekends. And have unbelievably incompetent CSRs."
"They brought my package all the way to my town and dropped it off at the usps where they lost my package. If they brought it all the way literally 8 minutes from my house why couldnt they just deliver my package. Dumping their work off and losing my package and then i have to deal with the mess on a christmas gift. Literally unacceptable, i specifically chose to not ship through usps because of this and now there is no ome i can trust."
"Arrived a day earlier than expected, excellent driver, could not have been more helpful. Overall experience 5 stars and we could not be happier."
Terrible service always tell me lies and all my products are late or damaged
Received my package. Looked ok. Opened the box and the item had a smashed broken wheel. Further looking the box had been smashed in the corner and cardboard flexed back out. Several wrinkles showed. Tried filling out the UPS online form for damage. Would not let me. Told me I had to contact seller. Wrong. Was damaged in shipment. Seller sending new wheel. Not worth fighting UPS.
They are RIP off merchants. Sent my dear old aunt a Xmas present of a phama and 2 dvds to spain. And she got charged 52 euros tax at her door. UPS UK said I had to call UPS Spain they can't help even though I bought it in UK. Disgusting service.
"Delivery man from UPS called me using very impolite tone, hurrying me up, telling me that he has work to do etc. This happened in the first 15 seconds of the call.

Such things never happened to me with other delivery services."
So after a little bit of a bad experience with ups customer service team. My local depot were able to sort out my problem. I can not thank ups Norwich depot enough your drivers are caring and their customer service is how the whole company should model themselves. Big shout out to Luke Swann who definitely goes above and beyond
So I ordered something off of the Sony website. It told us that we need to have a signature when it’s delivered. The UPS website said from 1230 to 4 is when it would be delivered. They delivered it at 10:30 in the morning. And nobody was there to sign off.
"Your the worst delivery system in the US. 2-3 day expedited means you’ll get it there within a week or two. I have an expedited high value order that is still waiting to be marked out for delivery. Personally I’ll be amazed if it shows up at all. And to top it off you have zero power to tell me what time of day my package might arrive. It’s something I have to be here to receive so I’m glad I can expect it sometime between 9am and 9pm some day this week!

I simply must remember to request other carriers when I order anything.

Your international shipping is a joke. I have used it for hundreds of packages. The ones that do show up arrive weeks if not months late. I’ll give you this you do it cheap. I personally would rather deal with someone who is more expensive, keeps their word, doesn’t loose packs at such alarming frequency and have much closer estimate on where my package is. Thanks."
Very happy with the service and delivery from UPS. Ordered a product from the US to be shipped to Sweden. Arrived earlier than expected and was delivered to my front door. Have used UPS many times. Aways good experience with them!
They try delivering without any warning during office hours to my home. They have my phone and email is it really that hard? When attempting delivery they do not leave any paper or anything to indicate they were here and (oh what a surprise that people actually do go to work) and there was no one at home. When you call them proactively because every day you track that package and agree that you will pick it up yourself they “screw something up in the system” and try the same no warning delivery to home at midday and send you package back to sender. What an awesome service.
"HUUUUUUUUGE DELAY with my delivery, no one contacted me to explain what is happening, very unhappy with their service."
Returning items is extremely expensive. Just returning a bikini was 23 euros. Buy only items you will definetly not return.
THEY DRIVERS ARE SCAMMER NOT DELIVERING PACKSGES TO THE RIGHT ADDRESS OR NOT JUST DELIVERING THEM..
"Absolutely the sh***iest experience from start to finish. They claimed two delivery failures when I was in and no one turned up, called or mailed. I contacted them for their third and final ‘attempt’ giving more specific instructions and confirming a 2pm-6pm slot. I got home to find they had a third delivery failure (at least they got to my apartment door this time and left a note to confirm their total incompetence). The delivery attempt was at 1:15pm!!! Useless AF. Terrible service, s***ty app, awful when you call. Promised to call me back to rearrange the third delivery on the same day but didn’t phone Avoid at all costs. I would leave zero stars, but I can’t."
Worst delivery service do not deliver the packages
0 stars this is the dumbest company ever I was suppose to recieve my package Friday between the hrs of 2:30 an 6:30 the driver came at 12:57. I’m working so now I miss my package delivery time an instead of them dropping the package off at the door or at a ups access point which is the cvs 2 mins away I have to wait until Monday to pick up my package from cvs . An it’s even more annoying because I paid for shipping an don’t understand why they can’t deliver the package on Saturday when they work Saturdays I even asked to pay extra to receive today an they said I can’t or I can’t just go an pick it up from the station. I’m going out of town which is why I needed the package before then Amazon would do a reattempt atleast same day or just drop it at the access point same day now I have to change my flight to get my package.
I pre orded a Pokemon Scarlet violet double pack so my brother and I could play a game the 18th when it came out ups delayed and now the game won't show up till the 21st ruining our weekend
"This company is not anymore trustable.
I am waiting a parcel but they are doing reschedule since Thursday (18th) but they are not delivering at new date as well.
@ 17th 18th and 19th you are saying you will come but will not?
Why I am waiting for you for 3 days ?"
"I ordered a Milwaukee heated hoodie from Amazon it said it was delivered to my side door on November 18th but it wasn’t delivered to my house or for that fact even in my town when I look at the shipping history it shows it was leaving Versailles Indiana and supposed to go to Greensburg Indiana but it was delivered 20 some minutes later to someone else house in Versailles Indiana.
I filed a complaint about this issue now it’s under investigation and they are telling me it can take up to 15 days to investigate this issue not only that when you have to file the complaint it was all automated wouldn’t let me talk to anybody in customer at all
so I kept calling until I finally got through to a customer service agent and I spoke with her and I asked her are you able to just contact the driver that delivered the package have them go back and get the package. That way it doesn’t get taken because if somebody opens the package they’re not gonna give it back for god sake’s is a $209 Milwaukee heated hoodie $219 and some change after taxes so I continuing to talk to her, she said somebody will contact you back in one hour what’s the best numbers to reach you at she didn’t want to deal with the issue, either even after talking to her and giving her my number I never even received the phone call back.
I’m sorry but if somebody is calling and can prove without a doubt that they never received there package that the driver messed and and delivered it to the wrong address because it was delivered in the wrong town all together.
Not helping your customers is how you lose business. If I would’ve had my choice, I would’ve chose FedEx all day long. I would’ve even chose the United States Postal Service over UPS at this point your customer service skills are not no good. You guys need to rewrite them and figure out how to take care of your customer customers are supposed to always be right, so with that being said.
Why does there need to be an investigation go back and get the package and deliver it to the right person in the right town at the right address
ITS NOT RIGHT AND COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOUR CUSTOMERS…"
"I wish I could give lower than a one star lol but I was supposed to receive my package on 11/17/2022 , they said it was delivered, still I have no package, I have video proof the ups guy never showed up to my home and they telling me it’s going to be 8 days to investigate, I was expecting my package yesterday for my birthday, so I had to replan thanks to UPS bogus service it’s 2023 almost and these guys still don’t take pictures of dropping the package, notify when arriving or nothing , I HATE UPS and will never USE them again . Upgrade your whole company they operate like it’s 1970"
Waiting for 3 weeks because UPS want a house number only or can't delivery. How a company this size doesn't know some houses have names and the useless app can't change this either. So my parcel keeps bouncing back and forth....
"They deserve negative rating, -100. Giving them even one is too generous. Every year they mess up my equipment delivery but this year 2022 has been the worst ever. Not only do their delivery people never bother to ring bells (they prefer knocking), they also donot even bother to call the recipient phone. Worse, their Customer Service Helpline has representatives who can't even understand a simple request to hold the package and you will pick it up yourself (as you really need the equipment). I called in 3 times today 11/18/2022, where the first representative at 2.30 PM, assured me I will receive to call within 1 hour to pickup the package. The call never came, so I called in a 2nd time at 3.30 PM and I was told that to pickup my package myself I would have to pay $7 additional charges. Needless to say that was shocking, so I requested a Supervisor (Sam) who told me that the previous representative never entered any request for pickup but she would enter it, waive the charges and I will get a call within 1 hour to pickup the equipment. As usual no call. I called in at 6.30 PM, the representative could not even understand what I was saying, so I
requested a Supervisor (Hulen) who after making me wait for 15 minutes just told me ""Oh sorry, the local office is closed so you can pickup the package on Monday"". He had no justification for why I never received a call at all and no intention of resolving the issue, otherwise UPS does do delivery on Saturday and Sundays!! It is quite apparent that UPS is using missed delivery as a way to extort more funds from recipients as well and if you don't pay, you don't get on time delivery or even ability to pickup your own package like me. Then interestingly at 7.20 PM, I get a missed call from ""BLOCKED NUMBER/PRIVATE NUMBER"" (so I can't call back) saying it is local office and pickup the package. I go to the Local office and it is closed. Wow, wow. The UPS App is worthless because it gets updated after god knows what timeframe.
The CSRs are untrained and have difficulty understanding English, whereas you get calls from blocked numbers with no way to verify veracity of caller. The ICING ON THE CAKE are the so called Supervisors (Sam and then Hulen), where one committed ( like previous representative) that I will receive a call within an hour (afternoon time) to pickup the package and the other simply says, sorry too bad you never received the call and we don't need to make it right.
UPS is the worst example of customer service and violation of customer rights."
"Ups claimed they “ missed me “ at my apartment but according to my ring bell no UPS driver has come near by, drivers need to be held accountable for not doing their job right, they should at least knock or get off their truck and try their best to give better customer service."
"The worst shipping company, currier which pickup packages is trowing them in his van, even if there is sign that is fragile. My package was protected for atomic bomb, and stupid driver still succed to damage it hardly, unbeliveble!!
I made ticket send picture of damage, today is almost 2 years never got F**** feedback. I wish atomic bomb close them asap, F**** service and staff which drinks whole day coffee and scraching their balls!!!"
"I was supposed to get a package delivered to me today, but I was at work. I work M-F. How the heck am I supposed to get my package if you all want to deliver it on my work days? Also, you deliver it before I get off work. AND I can't get in touch with a damn live person. I am so pissed. I can't find out if UPS delivers on Saturday or if I can set the day/time that I will be home to have it delivered."
Package delivered (once again) to the wrong address. It is impossible to contact UPS online without creating an account. They will not provide any customer service based on a tracking number alone. Horrible service.
"I am more than happy. Thank you UPS!
Less than 24 hours my package came to USA from Denmark. Everything was easy and perfect."
"It turns out that ups is not a company that I can trust from now on. Purchasing a shipping label online, only to be overcharged later on. Then called customer service for help, they don't seem to have a direct extension for billing. I spent over an hour with them on this issue alone."
Excellent information received. Delivery received on time and to the correct address which is often sadly lacking with other companies
"After sending the parcel, I get a letter stating that UPS has done new measurements on my package and raised the price with nearly 3 fold! Their measurements were very inquorate and in spite of sending them picture proofs they kept sending the bill and reminders.

You can get in a world of Kafka novel with this company. Do yourself a favor and choose another delivery way."
"UPS delivered the wrong package to our home. My wife tried her best to resolve the matter through UPS customer service over the phone. What a waste of time that turned out to be. She followed every instruction the so-called A.I. assistant called for. My wife carefully repeated the tracking number but the A.I. could never get it right. Finally, my wife asked for a human representative. No-can-do."
"I scheduled a pick up, they failed to pick my packages up and after speaking to a representative they agreed to send someone the next day. They again didn't show up. I called back with the same pick up number and they said it didn't exist and would schedule me a pick up. After 7 phone calls and 2 days I had to pay for another pick up. Honestly, done with UPS and by extension Amazon. I will avoid their service at all costs going forward."
"UPS' customer service is nonexistent! My packages was scanned into their Vernon, CA, facility on 10/17/2022 and it never left the UPS Vernon facility/never was delivered. I submitted a claim on 10/25/2022 and the automated UPS message said they'd investigate. Nothing has happened as of today (11/17/2022). I cannot reach a real human at the Vernon facility or in UPS Customer Service. The automated update the Customer Service system provided indicates that UPS has done NOTHING to find my package waylaid at the Vernon facility."
UPS was not able to deliver the item the first time since it was missing the suite number. Talk to them and fix that issue. Next day they said the same thing and charged me 7.99 to hold it at their facility. When I go to lick it up at the facility I find out it was being sent back to the sender. I call to get my money back and all of the sudden they can't transfer me to billing or no one picks up the phone. I feel scammed.
"Fast efficient delivery, one day earlier (fortunate that I was at home) than I had been advised by UPS."
"package lost and no response since 1 month , incompetent"
UPS sucks. They never deliver my package to my home. They go to my neighbors. I have a package that said it delivered at my door today and is no where to be found. I pay S&H to not receive my packages. You call and if you’re lucky speak to someone but the always got bs excuses…. We have GPS and they still can not get to your door….
"This is the worst company I've ever used I'd rather stand at the dmv then to use this company. I have gotten several packages from the postal service and fed x but ups is the only one that never and I mean never can deliver my packages and it's not for any reason. I have had more lost packages, I even had a delivery driver come to my door stand there and not even knock on the door then just leave on camera, now as of today some how I have a packages that is not coming from. What they say is a request from me to deliver it another day? How, how can I do that? why would I do that? literally sitting here waiting not to mention there costumer service is in another country can't understand them and they refuse to help and say nothing they can do. This is a garbage company and honestly nothing anyone can do about it but u promise this if people stopped using them we wouldn't have to deal with it. I recommend not ever going with them 21 bad experiences with this company and no fixes."
"Was home all day waiting for a parcel! I proactively call to make sure all was in order first thing in the morning! I specifically gave the door code. The drive doesn’t even come to the building and marks it as failed delivery attempt. Called back to find that their driver was not equipped with the POS to collect customs fee, so once again shipment delayed as UPS doesn’t supply the equipment needed to do the job!"
"Scheduled pick on Monday for next day 1-5PM. Driver comes at 10:22AM when business is not open; Schedule 2nd pick and no driver comes for 2 days. Various calls to ""Support Line"", and was told they have no access to drivers or gps on drivers.... for 2 days UPS continues to ""make requests"" for pick and 2 days NO driver. By far the worst customer service experience I have ever had. UPS your job is to pick up items and delivery them. I gave you 2 days. Going to FedEx now."
"UPS LIAR PERSON WORKING THERE
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE BAD
I AM VERY UPSET
I LOST A LOT MONEY WITH THEM
NO RECOMMEND
THIS IS AWFUL PERSON"
"I received an invoice to pay UPS's exorbitant brokerage fees for a small personal package to clear Canadian customs, and requested, in compliance with Canadian law, that they send me the documentation to self-clear the package so that I could avoid the brokerage fees. They told me they would send me the documents within 1-2 business days. 1 week later, I had still not received the documents so I called back. They told me that the package had been abandoned the same day as my previous call, because the package was being shipped to a PO box, UPS does not deliver to PO boxes, and they had been waiting for an address update from either me or the shipper. No mention of this had been made to me during my first call. I asked to escalate the case to a manager, was put on hold for 5 minutes, then faced a never-ending ring tone for another 5 minutes."
"If I could give a zero, I would! UPS is the worst, the absolute worst. If I could choose not to use them, I would in a heartbeat! But I can’t choose what shipping services sellers use. I have had so many expensive parcels “lost” conveniently! Never the inexpensive items only things that could fetch a price. Their customer service is nonexistent and they genuinely don’t care. They lost an expensive camera and when I asked where it was, they said they handed it off but couldn’t provide confirmation that it was successfully handed off, and when I ask why not, I was told that it wasn’t their responsibility anymore and to deal with it!!"
"The delivery driver for Fruita, CO fails to ring a doorbell or knock. And IF they do knock, it's like a 2 year old at the door knocking.......real soft!"
I went to the UPS store location to 557 in Atlanta and a young man named George Quinto help me. He was very polite and made my transaction very easy. You guys need definitely more employees like him. I will definitely come to this location more often to send off my packages. Thank you again George for all your help
"Watched my package drive by my house on the UPS tracker to go to a circle K. 6days waiting on a 2nd day air package requiring a signature. No wonder you can’t review UPS on google, they don’t want people reading this stuff"
"Here again we are notified that our package has been delivered, it hasn't been delivered or it was delivered to the wrong address. This happens ALL THE TIME. (One in every 3 deliverys) Drivers who are in too big of a hurry to make the correct drop off so they can get back to the office. 2nd, it's hell trying to contact a real person to relay this consistent problem. UPS has the sorriest customer service that I've encountered and has a serious problem about delivery service. We have no idea where our package is and its impossible to find out from customer service. This El Paso TX office needs a serious overhaul."
"Wow! Am I the only 5 star customer? I have had excellent service from this company...deliver to my door ( no depot drops like Purolator, which in my opinion is a no star) No issues or delays. The driver is really nice too. I will use them again."
"Driver did not come up on my address and just up[date the status that he attempted the address, its takes 5 times longer time than usual to get my parcel"
"If I could rate this 0 stars then I would as that's all UPS deserve.
I ordered goods (7 boxes) from China to the North West of England to be sent to a designated Amazon warehouse. The goods arrived into the UK and spent 4 days in their warehouse to undergo customs clearance which is fine.
The problems then started. UPS who is the forwarder then disbursed the boxes and sent them to Warrington, Preston, Tamworth, Edinburgh, Dunfermline for reasons unknown. What was a simple delivery as per label has not been delivered and boxes are now deemed lost but pending their investigation. One of the boxes did arrive at its actual Amazon warehouse but the other 6 boxes which should have accompanied this one are now in different locations around the UK, again only God knows why. Their app to track and trace is useless as its never updated. Even after a week it has not been updated. So now with Christmas round the corner, no stock, and my business is suffering as a result. UPSs inability to solve the issue as to why my goods are dotted around the country instread at its actual location is beyond me.
Customer services at UPS is ridiculous. Hopeless. They even said my goods had gone back to China which is alarming as they have no clue. I don't know if my items will be deemed lost or not but one thing is for sure.
If you want to ship with UPS, simply don't! You will lose time, money, sanity and the will to live as they are invisible and you cannot do anything about it.
TOTALLY AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
I sent a package to my sister when she got the box it was torn up and wet .Totally unprofessional way of handling Christmas packages .No joke the box was totally a wreck torn open crushed .Would you handle your family’s packages like that .I will totally be sending through the post office .
What’s the point of providing a delivery timeframe when your company doesn’t abide by it? Poor customer service and your phone representative did not adequately address the issue.
"Driver listed item delivered to front door when it was actually left on porch railing in the rain. And the replacement is en route to their hub, but they can't hold it for pick up when it arrives as it is signature required. No actual time expected today, so either I miss work or miss my shipment. Called in to an English customer support number to get an agent that barely speaks English."
"I created a shipment request from Italy to Philippines. I'm from Philippines. I left my coat in my hostel in Italy so I booked a shipment via UPS. The process wasn't smooth, first I got error in creation of shipment and charges reflected in my Paypal even though label wasn't created. Second, most horrifying part is that the website didn't really indicate the required forms for the shipment and I was later required to file them. Had I known that these info were required, I have prepared them ahead. UPS asked for info on these which I provided but they weren't accepted in 2nd customs check but I provided them that info already. I got charged for a returned delivery which only makes UPS happy."
"Honestly you deserve not to be in business. After spending an hour on the phone, being transferred to 4 decidedly rude people, that clearly could not understand what I was telling them. Both your app and website weren’t working and this is what happened at the other end.
From the purchaser
Hi, it's arrived. How it's in 1 piece I'll never know, as the UPS men threw it over number 45s back fence, and have bent one of her little trees. She was in the back garden so didn't hear the door, and it just came flying over the fence. We live at number 29, we were in. The van pulled up and I said they'll be coming here but they went straight to number 45 opposite. It was only now that she's brought it over that I've realised it was ours. Absolutely shocking. I'm going to complain to them."
"This company needs to be SHUT DOWN. The worst company in the world. No word will be enough for me to describe how awful they are. UPS, YOU ARE CRIMINALS. I don't know which organisation gives them licence to operate. We need to contact them. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH"
"Where to begin with these ... lack of a better word, dipsticks.
Package was SUPPOSED to be delivered on the 10th, get a notification that delivery has been missed, interesting considering I have been out the front of the house all day gardening and maintaining and not once has anyone stopped, let alone driven by in a van, truck ... anything that could even remotely pass for a delivery vehicle in the 6 hours I was out there.

Spend the next 6 days trying to track down my package only to find that it was delivered directly to the local post office and never once attempted to delivered to my home, despite the 3 ""attempted"" deliveries on the 10th, 11th and 14th.

Complete and utter BS."
I live at 707 W. Pierce St. in Lagrange Missouri I got the laziest UPS delivery driver I’ve ever seen. He’s too lazy to climb up three steps on the deck on the front of the house and put the package inside the dropbox. There’s a package sitting on my front deck right now covered with snow because the driver is so freaking lazy for fire this guy hire somebody who’s not too lazy to do their job. Thank you Greg Chatfield from Lagrange Missouri
"UPS is the worst package delivery service ever! Many companies use them to deliver items to their customers. They have only found our home in town 1 time. Our packages usually end up at a neighbors home. This time our package was originally expected days ago but was delayed by a holiday and whatever other excuse. Had to be gone on Monday for Dr's appointments. Delivery was attempted but of course we were out. Note left on door said delivery will be tried again on the next day. Online said delivery by 7:00 p.m. We waited and watched. No attempt at delivery at all. By 9:10 p.m. I called UPS @ 800-742-5877 a rep proceeded to tell me that ""delivery was delayed as the package is still in transit"". I asked if ""the package is still in transit"" how come delivery of the package was attempted just yesterday and why does tracking online still show ""delivery today by 7:00 p.m.? The usual ""I'm sorry. It's still in transit!"" Rude and stupid! Very helpful! NOT!"
"Came here just to write this review. I don't know what to say. First they ended up telling Apple they were delayed, so I get an email from Apple saying my package isn't going to be here. So I decide to wait until tomorrow. Surprise, they were delivering today. They never updated me, or Apple, or anyone, so I stupidly assumed that when UPS said their package is delayed, it must be delayed.

The driver didn't even knock. Just left a slip. Wish they would tell me or Apple what was actually going on.

Called their number. It was so glitchy I had to repeat myself. Lost connection (I don't lose connection or cut off). Called local stores. They put me on hold and never picked up, so the store closed and by that time it was too late.

Their website is glitchy, slow and laggy. And to have my package changed or updated, I have to pay a subscription of 14.99 a month. A MONTH. Shipping is cheaper but I guess not since they force you to pay money for something you already paid to ship."
"So I have a second day air package with some medication in it from Florida – you send me a notice that says it will be delayed by one day, so I reroute the thing to the local UPS store. 30 minutes later you send me another notice that says it’s going to get delivered on the correct day. I put off my plans to go to work 100 miles away for an entire day waiting on it then I spent probably two hours on the phone an hour and a half of which was trying to get a representative who finally tells me that the package is nowhere near my town, even though your online notification system says that it is here . You really suck. I can remember when you were a decent company that actually was effective and got things done but you suck now bad. You are a symptom of all of this country is becoming."
"The package wasn't even delivered to our property. instead down the road, package with a hole in the top. This isn't a one time problem. We live out in the country and the road splits into two for a short time before coming back together as one, apart of the split has our mailbox on it further down, and has the start of driveway. Instead USP like to deliver it partially down this split in the public road."
Why do I always have to go and pick up my packages??? I do not have a missed note on my door and they always leave my packages at Advance Auto on Matt Drive. This is the who purpose of shopping online so I don't have to leave the apartment. This is NOT the 1st time this has happened. Please correct this issue
"UPS advised that I owed duty on the item that they were delivering. I tried to pay the duty 3x on their site, following instructions as given and each time, the page erased my info and asked me to fill in my info again. When I called Customer Service for help, the rep said she could take payment but it would be an extra $6.78. I refused because that is daylight robbery. She transferred me to the technical dept for help. After following the rep's instructions which meant keying in all the info and not using the auto fill feature, the page came up with the info that this action is no longer available. Then the rep transferred me back to the brokerage dept which takes payment and asked them to waive the extra $6.78 since their website was giving me problems. If UPS wants to receive money from its customers, it must fix its website to make it easy. I would recommend that everyone stay away from using UPS. It's inefficient and I will never use UPS ever. FedEx seems to provide better service."
"I have sent 4 parcels in the same time to the same address and receiver. Guess what? 3 parcels been delivered, 1 parcel ""The package is being held for a future delivery date"" 😂 unbelievable. This company is getting worse and worse. I have they'll closing down soon"
"I waited all morning for the UPS driver to come deliver my package since I needed to sign for it. He buzzed my apartment quickly two times and I rushed to answer the door to let him in. By the time I got down there the UPS truck was already down the street. Driver definitely had the ""we missed you slip"" prefilled. So annoying.

Classic ""slap and dash"""
Y’all are always late delivering my packages. Waiting on one that should have been here the 9th and today is the 15th. Way to be true to your business ethics. Horribly done.
"the UPS worst company ever
2 months ago you made a damage to my machine and sent me a check with 200$
For the machine cost 5000$"
"I choose one star to be able and leave a review, this Ups store 5100 Acline Dr E. Tampa, Fl 33619, is not professional and so disorganized. Been waiting for work equipment for the past 4 days keeps on saying on transit, today it changed to second attempt, which they attempted at the wrong address, when I call they say won’t attempt until the next day and to pick up there’s a charge. It was their mistake and they want to charge! I advised I might loose my job due to their mistake and the ups rep just laughed. Will NOT recommend at all."
"company of pirates and criminals that uses criminal methods to fake receivers' signatures. a pirate ship that brakes contract law, that breaks vechel law, that breaks human rights and all the other laws even if you pay extra for signature and delivery to recipient's hands. that does not want to pay out insurance payouts even if they commit criminal activity. this is a joke and not a company.
the company that does not care about jurisdictions."
"Delivery exactly as promised .
Very easy to track ."
I live only 7 hours from my son. Sent a 2500 drone to him and it's been over a week. He still don't have it. It's been out for delivery for 4 days according to them. I finally got someone on the phone. And it was. Waste of time. He has no idea what he's talking about. Don't know how he expected me to understand. Never again. I will go through post office. And never go through them again.
"UPS are the most useless company. First I get a voicemail that I could hardly understand. I had to listen to it at least 6 times and still not sure what she was saying. Now it is telling me that I have to pay customs charges but I cannot pay them without creating an account on their website, (why not?!) and when I try to do this, it just goes to a continuously loading page that never loads. The web chat doesn't give a phone number and it goes in circles, all a robot, no human. Absolutely hopeless and will avoid and hope others do the same. So many better options out there, when you order from ebay you don't always know which courier the seller will use to ship. I have warned the seller in my case. I just hope I get the item and it's not damaged."
Rude disrespectful they yelled at me they cost at me like they’re from another country who has no respectable qualities or good customer service
"Just don't. I can't tell you how many times they have lost my packages, and this time I'm out $235 while they ""investigate""."
"I would rate you 0 if I could!

I was excepting a print from Spain (to London) and it has never arrived!
I accepted to spend this much money online because I had to scan my ID to
purchase the item and get it delivered by UPS. I was suppose to sign a document on delivery and show my passport in order to retrieve the parcel.
Instead of this I had nothing but a notification telling me it was left to someone I don't know!!!!
None of my neighbours or shop owners around are called this way...I opened a claim and they first accused PackLink, the Spanish carrier, to be responsible, even though I paid UK custom taxes! After I sent those documents through, they just close the investigation sending me back ""the proof of delivery"" with a random first name on it! What a joke! On the phone they once told they found it back but now I apparently need to speak to the shipper who doesn't reply anymore - it's been weeks, I'm hopeless

Funny fact - a few days after, I was waiting for another UPS delivery, this time it wasn't suppose to be signed but they decided to require one, surely because of the running investigation.
Turns out the parcel was left in the street behind the bin, by chance it was a rain jacket so no damage but honestly you guys are the worst ever!"
"Went through most customer support with no real help except being told shipment would be arriving the next day. After spending the $7 change delivery through the website cause, the application wouldn’t allow me to change to the same location as I did through the website. So first of all app issues, customer support may not have been local, as after receiving a call from an employee about picking up at the customer center it was a quick 2 minutes of informative information. The other 3-4 calls did nothing for me or help me figure out how to acquire my package the same day I missed it."
"I've never known a company be so useless at the one thing they're supposed to do. Just put the parcel in the bin, it's cheaper and just as likely to be delivered."
I've had my application in for over a month and no return call but I did receive a email but when I was talking with a representative they didn't know how to help either
"Local ups in paraguay is a scam. They charge whatever they want as customs charge. Lines are always down, costumer service is based on costumer avoidance."
"Pongo una estrella porque no puedo poner menos. Estas personas han extraviado un pedido de Apple, un
iPhone 14 plus, cuando llamo cuelgan y m dan un número de 4 cifras para que llame porque te cobran cargos adicionales. Una mensajería peor imposible!!!!
I put a star because I can't put less. These people have lost an order from Apple, a

iPhone 14 plus, when I call they hang up and they give me a 4-digit number to call because they charge you additional charges. A worst impossible messaging!!!!"
"Cambuslang delivery and collection driver is useless and disappointment for the company and the customers. Has been booked for collection had two opportunities to do the job he is getting payed for and on both occasions failed to do so, causing my business time and money. Hope this massage will reach his management and get disciplinary action for the drivers laziness and incompetence!!!"
"I’m usually not a person that writes reviews but something needs to be done. UPS customer service platform is by far the worst ever. No matter how you try you CANNOT speak to an actual person. The virtual assistant does NOT help and will NOT connect you to a person. I have used many of shipping services and UPS is by far the worst. Just for a little background, I was supposed to receive a package that was out for delivery 5 days ago now when tracking the package it states information not available information will be updated later. So frustrating. Anyone that is having a package shipped do what ever you can to ensure UPS is not the one handling your package."
"Worst Shipping Company. Ordered next-day delivery, online status said it would have been delivered. Didn't get delivered. Stayed home again today to receive the package, still nothing.

Worst service/communication/website of all shipping companies."
"I made an order over the phone as my box parameter didnt fit their online forms (Lisbon - London). The booking went all well, but I was told I could pay the driver cash and get a receipt which I thought it was a bit odd.
The day comes, the driver comes and happily pockets my money and says he cant issue a receipt and it'll come by email then rushes off as he was already an hour late.. didnt receive a receipt via email, so called their customer service, who said it would come by post. So I waited and rather than a receipt I got three lovely bills in the mail! Which amounted to even more than I was quoted on the phone. So I call customer service again, friendly enough people but unable to help so 'opened up a case'. Didnt hear back and now am receiving late payment charges for something I have already paid in full!
I am contesting the bills but am sure I will be left with no choice but to pay the extra, my cash probably went straight into the drivers pocket (naïve of me) despite this being their 'official procedure'.. My advice, avoid this lot and go with a better company."
"In the 4 years I’ve lived in Sweden, never once has UPS delivered a package to my door. Every single time I receive a message about a failed delivery attempt and every single time I was at home waiting for my package. No one calls, no one rings my doorbell and when you call their customer service you get in touch with some outsourced office that has no power or authority to do anything.

As much as possible I try to only purchase from places who don’t use UPS as a carrier because they are absolutely horrible at their job. Incredible how many companies can get it right but for some reason UPS never does."
"UPS are the WORST for delivering packages my package was supposed to be delivered yesterday, check and called automated #, they said I would receive it Tuesday now it's supposed to be here by 8:00, I wish there was a way to avoid using them altogether"
Ups is the worst company I ever had to experience. This is not the first incident where they claimed they delivered a package and it's missing. I spoke to customer service and they told me dispatcher would reach out to me and to be on the lookout for a call. But nothing. Sad part is I can’t even get a replacement because the products are out of stock so I’m out of luck. Very terrible company. I don't know when some businesses still use them.
"Very high value of goods were shipped in October, but till now the goods is not delivered. Track&Trace is stopped in the beginning of November. I attempted to contact more than 15 times, and all contact people replied nonsense. One said it will be delivered this week for sure. Another one said it is lost. And one guy said ""'we already inisiated the investigation"". I answered, ""it is not possible. I was just told by another person that you have a system problem."" All contact service is not functioning. They are all liers."
"Over $100 to ship a letter next day air with UPS....sent on a Friday morning, tracking shows estimated delivery Monday. Contacted UPS who was hard to understand due to foreign accent ""oh we do not do delivery on Saturdays or Sundays"". I said but it was paid for as next day air...nope not on Saturdays or Sundays. WHAT??? Terrible service will never use UPS again. Wish the post office had been open. Less expensive and next day air is next day air!"
"Ups is a joke! I pay for rush shipping on a package, I was supposed to get to me the next day. I’m tracking the package all day on delivery day, the system is stating that the package would be delivered by 7 pm that day, I go back to check the system and the system was then changed to the package being delivered on Monday. Why pay for express shipping if your not going to do you job. I’m expecting a full refund on the rush shipping."
"And once agian a package that was supposed to be delivered on a saturday wasn't. They put in a crappy response about the Business being closed. Humm I'm not a business so that's intresting, Newegg is about to lose a customer if they can't get UPS to deliver packages when there supposed to. I called and complaned once and wound up having to wait an extra week. Gotta wonder why UPS keeps letting there drivers get away with not doing Saturday Delivers."
"Do Not use this disgusting Excuse of of Courier Service
My Husbands watch was organised to be delivered to my home address.
It was taken to a collection point miles away from were I live .
The Courier driver said he had been to my home & no one was in he Lied I was I also have a ring door bell to prove he/or she never came near my home address,
When challenging UPS on the customer services Telephone number spoke to Mary she didn't won't to know asked her can I speak to a Manager she told me someone would ring me back within 1 hour this never happened
We as customers are paying good money for this company to operate You have Failed & you need to be named & shamed for your appalling services
You don't deserve to have good honest customers paying
DO NOT USE"
I just had a package delivered and the envelope literally looked as though someone had walked on it with dirty boots on and it was dripping wet. No pride in how you deliver a customer package. I wouldn't use someone who doesn't take pride in what there doing.
"If I could give no star i would,,my shipment from India reached here to UPS office,we got no notification to pay customs,i called myself then i was told I have to pay customs.I did that and now after 10 days i am calling almost everyday to find out when will i recieve the package..Absolutely no commitment towards service..Ridiculous is the only word"
"My package arrived at ups on a Monday. I was waiting by the door for ups delivery. Even did some yard work while waiting for UPS. I came inside to wait. Had to sign for the delivery. I checked my email and there was an email from ups that the driver said sorry we missed you. I called ups to tell them I was home and no delivery person came to my door. I called several times. A supervisor told me he would put my package on hold and I could pick it up the next day. Went to ups the next morning and was told the package was on a truck. The package was not on hold. The supervisor lied to me. I waited on the delivery where the delivery time changed 3 times.
I called Corporate. I told them what was happening with my mail. The corporate office called the driver while I was on the phone. My package arrived within 2 hours. When all else fails call Corporate."
"UPS failed to deliver a perishable package on Friday. The tracking information states an attempt was made at 4:24 pm at the business but it was closed. This is not a business but a rural address. The driver falsified his statement. No attempt was made. Too close to quitting time. This is the Kerrville, Texas distribution center. Someone should be fired for lying."
"The UPS driver was courteous and friendly with a welcoming smile - he obviously enjoyed his job and is definitely a credit to your company.
It's a pity that a lot of other delivery drivers can't take a leaf out of his book!
Please thank him from me."
Friendly delivery driver.
If I could give it no stars I would. Horrible customer service. Worthless tracking and no one has any idea what is going on within the company. It's like everyone is just blind to what their job is.
"UPS is the absolute WORST for delivering packages! ZERO URGENCY! They give you a date to expect your package and don’t deliver that day then make you wait three more days while it sits in a shipping sorting location. Their customer service dept is absolutely useless. Save your self the headache and have your packages shipped via Fed Ex, DHL or USPS. I have received packages from Japan faster to the US and this package was within the US. Never again UPS!! You are horrible!!!"
There is this guy that works at the UPS store at the Sharidan plaza location in Amherst n.y. that likes to disrespect me every time I go there he has a serious attitude problem I should have reported him along time ago but i don't want to be like that but yesterday he crossed the line now I am going to do everything I can to get him fired.
"Package was said 2 be delivered 11/10 at 7pm, it's 11/11 and 7:53 pm still no Package, I was told call in the morning because the package is probably lost"
"They never provide a positive experience!!! Every time deliveries have problems, and they always change the delivery time. This company is garbage! Make sure, the store you're making an order from doesn't deliver it with this garbage!!!"
"UPS is a farce, I tracked my parcel and it said delivery by the end of Thursday, then after checking a few days later it said rescheduled from Thursday to Friday, today is Friday and you guessed it, yes checked tracking again and now its rescheduled to Monday!!! What the hell!!

When Monday comes 100% the dimebars will reschedule again.

And for the UPS robot who keeps replying to everyone's reviews with the exact same reply of ""contact us on twitter or Facebook"", I do not use Facebook or twitter! How bloody unprofessional, contact you on twitter or Facebook? How about giving people your email. As if a company can only be contacted on Facebook and twitter, no wonder your courier service is a joke..."
Customer service is extremely rude and disrespectful. UPS is literally the worst delivery service in America. Complete garbage.
"I ordered merchandise on Amazon so apparently ( I didn't know this ups was the delivery)
I waited for this pkg for over a week
It was very nice outside so I decided to do some yard work
I was out there til 6 pm
Got a notification stating that my PKG was delivered at 3:45 pm
What ? I was already out there there was no ups truck at all ... I'm use to Amazon and I always get my packages ...Amazon needs to NOT allow ups to deliver their packages and stick to their own drivers ... I've never had a problem untill now .. will be more careful as to who the delivery service is next time... I will never deal with ups ever again"
"I called to change an address/request hold for pickup on my package. Of course they outsource customer service and so there's a communication barrier. After asking 3 times where my package would be held and being told they can't tell me that until after I pay because the system doesnt allow that, I hung up and did it through the automated system, which gave me a pickup address before requesting payment. The address error was my fault, so I'm not upset I have to pay to hold my package, but them having a system in place that doesn't allow for verification before payment is ridiculous. This is why I use only FedEx for shipments."
I’m so sick of ups. My purse was shipped through ups and they couldn’t bother to give me a single update the whole time they had it. And now I’ve these slippers coming in and they are holding them bc I wasn’t there to collect them.. I shouldn’t have to be there to collect a 10$ pair of slippers. JUST LEAVE THEM AT THE DOOR AND IF THEY GET STOLEN THATS ON ME BRO. I shouldn’t have to pay a redelivery fee bc y’all can’t follow my simple instructions to leave them at the front door. Absolutely ridiculous. If I could give 0 stars I would. SMH.
"The driver was so unprofessional because for one they sent my very important documents to my old address, even though I specified my new mailing address. Secondly, he incompetently gave my package to the painters in the old house and luckily they weren’t frauds/scammers. They had to give my package to the landlord and when I called customer service they just kept saying uh uh ! Worst DELIVERY SERVICE EVER AND HE SHOULD BE REPRIMANDED ! I’m highly upset with this level of ignorance.."
Difficulties to return the package with UPS.
"This time that you say there is no customer service at all. UPS is not working at all, negligent ignorant not a single try to service their unlucky customers dealing with them. I ve been trying by my own to get my parcel 3 days now and they re just fooling around wasting my precious time. And I m not the only one. Here in Greece ups is the same appalling disturbing Courrier company as in the USA with thousand of disappointed customers. they should shut the scum company down ."
"Worst delivery ever.
Done to me yesterday . He said none at home but I saw the driver just stop in corner of my building and sent notifications I wasn't home and drive away while I saw him not even get out from his damn car and just away without set his foot out his delivery car. Worst company.
And it been happening 2x when the sender using ups. Unreliable company"
"The offer the worse service ever
From the web site to their way of deliver
I hate it"
Ups app clearly mentioned that package will be delivered between 1.30pm- 4 pm specially when signature required delivery is scheduled and they came to deliver at 953 am. Ups should be mindful of public that they are working and can’t be sitting on the door waiting for ups driver whole day.
Your customer service sucks I've been trying to get a package for 3 days and it has not been delivered because the driver cannot deliver it to my address and then they couldn't find the driver and then I went to pick it up from the hub like requested and no one put it on hold So now my package gets sent back because it's been 3 days this is why FedEx should take over cuz you guys are going down slowly
"This company has gone down hill since COVID 19. They no longer take care of their customers. They knock on the door, drop the package, and leave! These valuable packages could get damaged by rain, broken, or worse stolen! I ask the two fellows who was in my driveway about to pull away, ""Why they just drop of the package and leave?"" They replied, ""we don't have the time to wait for you to answer the door."" Yet I have worked at business where they come in, drop of the package, get my last name, and say have a nice day ma'am. If they got a minute for business they should have plenty time to make sure packages arrive at our homes safely. Before in the past if someone wasn't home they'd take the package to the nearest post office. I sure hope none of my packages get ruined while I'm away from home!"
Worst delivery service I would not recommend having anything shipped through UPS. Seriously doesn’t expect to get your package. Customer support also not helpful. No alternative pick up options. Signature required. Who cares if you work 15 hour days and are not available normal hours. Oh and you have weekends off! Well to bad they don’t deliver on weekends. Honestly what a joke
"If I could give zero stars I would
Stated parcel delivered and it was not. Stayed deliveries attempted and nothing not even a card
Phone customer services who stated the Cumbernauld depot have no phones!!!!!!!
Over 2k of stock lost
Don’t ever use"
past 4 months have not gotten a single package on time . always some kind of delay or extra trouble you have to go through to find out where your package is . unfortunately a lot of vendors use UPS don’t understand why . i would never personally go with UPS as a shipping service .
"We used UPS to deliver our goods from Germany to the UK, UPS could not confirm the location of the 5 boxes in transit, on hold to custom service helpline for hours, redirected multiple times to different departments and phone calls terminated without answer to the queries, and ultimately only 3/5 boxes delivered, UPS confirmed 2 of the 5 boxes are lost giving no explanation other than please discuss with your distributor.
Shocking service from the outset, I wish less than one star was an option."
"My sister sent a package canada with toys inside for my daughter worth 40 dollars,She paid 160can dollar, iam in italy when they trying to deliver it they are asking me to pay another 106 euro.. UPS IS A THIEF A SCAM.."
"I don't know how else to describe this awful company. Their internal communication is so bad. No matter how many times you call or email, nothing works. One department has absolutely no communication with another department. I mean, I believe people sitting next to each other in the calls centre doesn't even know each other's names! don't expect your parcel to get delivered if you work with UPS."
"Absolutely horrific company. They said my parcel was delivered, I was at home.. the bell never rang, nor was there a knock, or a phone call. I have now lost £200 worth of goods . Extremely upset and angry and they seem to be doing nothing to correct their error"
Apparently UPS attempted delivery 3 times and they DIDNT. Furious is an understatement. They never even came to my house!!!! UPS has straight up gone down the drain. Fed ex is the way to go!
OMG … This is the second time in three months UPS has cost me to lose money … first time I never got my package delivered so I had to pick it up from their warehouse which was late and had a piece of equipment I needed for my business … then I paid overnight delivery on 7 November 2022 and guess what! … it never arrived … $74 dollars waisted … need this package from Arizona for an event from the 11-13 of November 2022 … called customer service (and that was a whole other mess) just to be told it was on the wrong truck (that’s what they told me about the other undelivered package) … I PROBABLY would get it on Thursday or Friday … explained to the gentleman that was unacceptable and this has happened twice with their deliverys to me … the man then said I would get it on Thursday and they would prioritize it (which I don’t believe) and to keep an eye on the tracker … this was at about 8:45 on the 9th of November (which is also my birthday) … the tracker still just says delayed and still in Arizona … I will make sure to put this problem everywhere on the internet and never recommend their services … I do not know if they know what the word “guarantee” means but at this point I highly doubt it
They still your stuff and then put a Mexican on the phone to explain why they stole your stuff worst ever never use or suggest you to anybody else unless they want their 😡 stolen NO STARS
What happened to UPS? Did they get too big or completely offshore their entire business? Customer service is very bad. They pretended not to hear me and then hung up without resolving the issue. The drivers are not attempting delivery. Has UPS been taken over by crooks? Fed Ex is the way to go. I have lost faith in UPS. 11/9 1:00 pm - customer service call to 1800-742-5877 it’s recorded right? Take a listen
Terrible customer service. Delivery was literally at the “end of day” even though it was a company address. They made me wait for the package the whole day and they wouldn’t give me the phone number of the driver so I could arrange the pickup.
Well I think the question for everyone is how can UPS be sooo incompetent and lacking in every single way? They are the worst shipping company I've ever delt with everytime I see that ups is the shipping company I realize I'm in for hours of calling trying to track my package to them never finding my address when every single shipping co. Other then them are able to find it with absolutely no issues and further more seeing as to how they can never actually make it to my house with a package I always opt out for agreeing to pay the almost $8 charge for them to hold my package at their facility so I can come get it Wich is obsurd who makes someone pay their company for them to not have to do their job? Then after paying they tell you they'll call in an hour Wich never happens and the next day after you done paid them to place the hold on ur package and you drive all the way there to get it you find a little note on their door saying their only open 8-11am and then 4-7 like you'd think that information would have been disclosed while talking to them but you find it out only after driving all the way there. They are hands down the worst and thats to no exaggeration like I wouldn't have even given them one star but they force you to before being able to write
"They are threatening the customers that they will destroy the packages, i have send a drone with them
and they stopped it because of the batteries (DJI DRONE) i have sent them all the documentation that those batteries are safe from the manufacturer they ignored it and they won't return the package and won't ship it, careful i think that they are trying probably to steal the items.
it's took them 10 days to send an email that said there were batteries (so they need to stop all packages contains laptops and mobile phones?)."
"Don't use UPS.
I received only 1 of my 2 package shipment so called to enquire.
They also had misspelt my suburb with another suburb, so I was really concerned it would be sent to the other suburb.
I was informed the package hadn't arrived in the country so they couldn't change anything until it was in Australia.
2 days later I called back & was told yes it had arrived but they couldn't & wouldn't correct the address until after a failed delivery attempt.
I was not happy that they were going to attempt to deliver my parcel to a completely different address & I had no way of changing or stopping it.
I checked my original paperwork & had given them the correct address but somehow it was misspelt on their system.
It's now been 5 days & through tracking I can see they have not attempted to deliver this parcel.

The 3 times I called customer service the lady was very rude & said nothing could be done & they weren't able to offer any information on when It was going to be delivered & all I could do was wait till it was showing out for delivery.
This is ridiculous because I choose UPS & paid an express service because they had stated it was a 1-3 delivery from UK to Australia. I didn't really expect it to be as quick as 3 days, but never expected it to be weeks & with no tracking & rude customer service who have never made any attempt to track my parcel or follow up.
My packages arrived in Australia within 3 days but has just sat in their distribution centre for the weeks. Why were they able to deliver one of the packages in the shipment in a reasonable time, but not the other?
Never dealt with such rude & unhelpful customer service & will never use UPS again."
"They’re either stupid or just don’t care. Package arrived and was processed 2 weeks ago at their warehouse, but for whatever reason they still haven’t delivered it yet. When I call customer service they tell them they can’t track my package because the number is incorrect. How the f can I search for the package number on your website and find my shipment and you can’t find anything? Then they gave me a non existent local phone number to call and ask"
"Its so difficult to get on their website and request that deliveries be left at a safe place.

How are these numpties still operating?"
I ordered my buss pass took £20 it hasn't arrived UPS is a bad company can't deliver properly they should shut down if I could do a proper rating it would be 5 for the worst UPS will be sued all mu parcels never properly get delivered I don't know what to do.
At this point it feels like they sabotage themselves on purpose. This company is such a catastrophe I just can't believe they're not trying to go bankrupt.
UPS has slowly declined to the what it is now. The management sucks when they receive complaints and do not hold the drivers accountable for not delivering packages to the door . They throw packages in your yard with no plastic over the item to protect against the elements. There is no pride nor a quality service provided. It is a shame because there are a handful of good delivery folks but few and far between.
"I was given misleading informartion,about the delivery the delivery date was changed with no notice and I did not receive the item. It was alleged delivery to someone I do not know and here is no trace of the item. There is no photographic proof it was delivered, only a delivery note I had to hunt to find as it was delivered 4 days early with no notification to me."
"I paid an extra £3 on a parcel to be delivered to my home rather than my local dry cleaners for me to collect from. Got email from UPS on Monday saying it would deliver on Tuesday morning. I clicked on track parcel in the afternoon to find a message saying UPS had already delivered my package to my local dry cleaners. I understand from the company I bought from that they are only supposed to do that if they are unable to deliver it to me. They did not ring my doorbell and would have driven straight passed my door. Luckily it was actually delivered to the dry cleaners. Have met another person at dry cleaners with so called proof from UPS that their parcel had been delivered, however the dry cleaners had not received their parcel.
It is usual behaviour from UPS to receive an email with date and time window for delivery and then parcel to be delivered on another day with no email informing one of this. Usually the parcels are at least one day late. In my latest case, it was one day early and delivered to the wrong address,"
"if i could give no stars then i would how this company are still in business astounds me , must be by selling all the parcels they don,t deliver! I know this is not the delivery drivers fault but i was buzzed on the door entry system answered it no reply buzzed again still no reply looked out the window shouted to the delivery driver he just walked away turns out he was deaf and dumb! what can you say at least he found the address but should he be employed to do this job!"
I live in a gated community and this is the only delivery company i ever have to track down because they never attempt to call me when they arrive and they say my address is in correct and fail delivery. No other company has an issue with calling me at arrival so why is it so hard for UPS?
I kept getting notifications saying my package would arrive on diffrent days. Tracking it is a waste of time also. So now they are trying to figure out where my package is. My fault for thinking a delivery service would deliver a package.
"When shopping for items we always choose the home delivery option. Despite this, when UPS is unfortunately in charge of delivering these items, almost every single package gets forwarded to random ""pick up points"" that are usually very far from our home. It often takes us 30-60 minutes to retrieve them on weekends because we have to commute by bike or walking.

UPS uses the excuse that ""no one was home for the delivery to be made"", yet we are almost always home (my partner works remotely) on weekdays when these deliveries take place. We never see any delivery trucks at the windows. We are pretty certain they are lying about most of these deliveries because of our security cameras. There is almost never a delivery truck outside when they say it was, on top of that we almost never get a ring or knock at the door.

No one ever actually shows up, they just toss the packages at random tobacco shops.

I would never willingly use this delivery service, but unfortunately, run into having to deal with it sometimes. Now the moment we get an email from UPS, we roll our eyes and prepare for another trip across town to track down our packages."
"I was waiting all morning for my delivery, the courier never came, just dropped it off at a pick-up point and when I called customer service they said that ""no-one was in"" (as if I don't know where I am?!) and if I can go and pick it up!! Wtaf"
"I've paid for shipping from UK to Poland. On delivery, it has occurred that I need to pay tax for sending my clothes from myself to myself (UPS doesn't know legislation!) and they have charged tax of almost 200%. Despite sending a few emails about it, I've never received detailed calculations.
Order: 1Z5T62J76820002413

AVOID! THIS IS A SCAM!"
"I swear I'd written a review before but as I don't see it, I'll re-write it. My tracking number for this dispute is 1Z51M6TUDK20015013 and occurred in March 2022.
I sold a new piano keyboard on ebay and used UPS to send it from East Kent to Croydon. I wish I'd just delivered in person. Ultimately, it went ""missing"" and I had to fight for a refund. Luckily I had purchased the 'Declared value' option, but it still took hours and hours on phone, about 2 months to resolve, and I had to threaten legal action to get the full declared value as they didn't want to pay vat. They also didn't pay a full purchase refund either, about £20 short. So I paid that £20 to have my goods essentially stolen. The keyboard box was over 195cm long and weighed 22kg, unfortunately, it had fancy keyboard graphics on the box which was as tall as me. UPS might have issues with the statement of it being stolen as that isn't technically proven, but giant keyboards don't just disappear into thin air. It was never recovered, so the only thing that could've happened was that it was stolen. The whole process of shipping to getting a refund was extremely stressful.

Firstly the UPS collector did not follow the website's procedures for collection and refused to sign paperwork that their website told me to get for declared value proof. Because of this I watched it on the tracking like a hawk.

Tracking was inconsistent, saying 'out for delivery' one day, then 'processing' the next. I would get different stories from each person I talked to. The tracking timeline was altered as it went along, but I took screenshots of it. Warehouse asked me to put a ""tracer"" on it, which I did through customer service after hours on phone. A week later, no such tracer had been put on it. I had to put another tracer on it. After a week of it missing, I got daily calls from warehouse manager who was upset, he seemed genuinely upset and confused how something so big could go missing. Eventually, 2-3 weeks later, they declared it as 'Lost', and I could proceed to getting a refund. After hours and hours and hours of phonecalls, emails, 2 lots of complicated claim paperwork, after another 2 weeks, I got a phonecall from UPS Germany who said they'd only pay 600 (of 900) because they ""won't pay the VAT based on the terms and conditions."" However, their EU terms and conditions and the declared value paperwork both say nothing about a VAT or Tax in regards to making a claim for a lost item. I had to fight this and threaten legal action. they quickly changed suit and made good, paying the full amount of keyboard on the Declared value, and were meant to pay a refund on the UPS service prices, but did not pay for all of it. It was £20 short but I gave in and did not pursue as I was exhausted with it after about 2 months of fighting.

Lastly, I wrote the customer service team and the CEO at the time, Scott Davis, about the whole experience, and did not hear from them or get an apology.

UPS employ thieves and have horrible customer service. I will never use UPS again. I would recommend you use any other company.

TrustPilot, I have evidence for this claim so if this review is disputed by UPS, just contact me."
"My delivery was re schedule 3 times in the last 3 days, this service is a joke."
"Didn't receive package on time, supposedly they tried to deliver and it was closed. Guess what, the deliver was a hotel. This was an excuse to avoid delivering. I called customer service and in two occasions the members lied about a deliver coming that same day. Never got an update or a reminder about shipping the product. Will never use UPS again. (Shipping record 1ZY9768A4498916154)"
Packages always late! Couple of times I never got the package.. complained to the head office but they didn't seem to care .whose to say they don't keep the pancakes for themselves? No explanation of where the packages went and why weren't they delivered..haven't had a good experience with them for the longest time.. something needs to be done too poor of service...
If I could give ZERO stars I would they lost my package I tried to contact them by phone but there is no human representative to talk to beside the robot which is useless and frustrating and I am also unable to create a claim via their website.
"Every time when I need to print something I go to your store on Charles Street in Boston. I did the same today morning. All the guys there are always nice and helpful but today was a rude young lady who really did not care. She told me to do it by myself which I started to do. First , you swipe your credit card, UPS charge you 20$ and then you start. After I started, the UPS lady heard me and my friend talking that I have an email with Apple and then she said that it does not work with Apple email addresses. Ok, we could not do anything but she charged me 2$. I am asking why?? She did not say anything in advance. It was not my fault that the computer did not work properly.

She did not show any desire to help. The guys in liquor store printed my ONE list of paper with no problems."
"The worst postal service money can buy.

I've ordered home delivery 7 times and each time they don't call and wont show up even if you provide them essential gate codes or phone numbers.

Everytime I had to call them and book a new delivery, each time they did the same thing.

Had you wait for hours at end for a package that never arrives, and eventually dumps it at the closes service point (which this time is in another damn city 2 hours away from where I live).

This company will only take your time and your patience and fail to do anything else but to upset you."
"This company used to be my goto for shipping needs but not any more. 3 times in a row they have fallen down and showed absolutely no interest in my needs as a customer. It's now to the point where their call center, which is known for expansive phone trees, now refuses to let you reach an operator. The message actually tells you that! If you don't guess correctly at each step there is no option to reach a human. They will let you email them but no one responds. The only way I got a response in through the Better Business Bureau. My latest issue is they refused to deliver my package unless someone is there to sign for it. Sounds great until you realize they give no time when they will be there. They done seem to care that some people still work and cannot take the day off to sit around the house and wait for their delivery truck. There is absolutely no way to change the delivery or request a change. They say there is but that in only through a phone call (see above) or an online portal that doesn't work. The only way they will change is if we as customers push our purchases to be delivered by the competition. Fed Ex was more than happy to deliver my package."
Worst customer service EVER!!!!!!!!! They say my package needs a signature and I WAS HOME BUT THEY DIDNT RING MY DOORBELL!!! I called and left SPECIFIC instructions to leave it and THEY DID NOT!! Then I called to have it re-routed to a UPS location and guess what THEY DIDNT RE-ROUTE IT!!!!! I am not sure why everyone is so INCOMPETENT!!
"Ordered something online with a promised 24-hour delivery. Got a notification that UPS had received my order the same day, and they confirmed that a delivery would take place on the 4th of November. They gave a time between 9:30 - 12:30, then changed the time to 10:30 - 13:30, then changed it to the end of the day, and just never showed up. Received another notification telling me the delivery is planned for today, the 7th of November. Original time being 10:30 - 12:30, they then changed the time to 7:00 - 9:00. According to the tracking number, the package hasn't even left their local shop. I have no idea if the package will arrive today, but the lack of communication and faulty information is outstandingly bad."
"Unbelievable bad customers service, booked a pick up they made me waste from 9am to 530pm waiting and the idi^@ never came, I called them the same day about 430 to ask of they were still
Coming and they told
Me, yes! Don't worry.what a sh%@ show they are running."
I wish I could give a minus because that is what they deserve. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve a delivery and billing issue. I have been promised over 6 call backs by end of day and NOT once have they done as promised! I will not be using UPS again as their lack of customer care seems to be routine of late. Today while speaking with a rep and hoping resolution has been achieved she transfers me to the automated billing department in which I had to start over again. UPS you honestly are the WORST!
"Parcel delayed multiple times
Parcel due 24th Oct. Received delay notices with meaningless explanations on 24th, 25th and 26th. No communications on 27th. Parcel now ""expected"" by 29th. This is shockingly bad communication and customer service at its very worst. If I treated my customers this way, I would have none left. The sender is a small business in Hungary, and they put UPS to shame. 1 star is one star too many."
They r worst of their kind in customer service and response.
The ups driver keeps taking my packages to the wrong address and keep marking my items as delivered and dont bring them. This has happen multiple time and nothing is done about it . Recently a package was marked as delivered and not bought to my home
They say my package is out for delivery but it doesn't come and then says delivery next day and still not here. Now it's scheduled to be delivered on Mon. This happens a lot and is not an isolated incident. I've had packages returned to the sender because they say they can't find my house. If that's true why did I get earlier packages delivered by them and why didn't they call for directions. I never ship using them but can't control how things are shipped to me. They are really terrible.
"Absolute TRASH!!! I had to call five times today I was expecting a package with a band new iphone and they claim they came and missed me.. but no because me and my kids were outside all day so after giving them crap, they claimed the driver was going to come back by and then when he didn't they tried to tell me he came back.. but said they missed me again.. again no one , not to mention every single time I called I was promised.. reassured someone would call me back.. I never got one phone call back from them I had to keep blowing them up, and the first time they told me they were having the driver come back the guy in the phone straight up said the driver lied! So wheres my iphone if someone is claiming they came not once but twice.. but I know for a fact ups did not come in this neighborhood at all today.. and of course it'sa Saturday.. so basically they will just bull crap you on the phone just to get you off then never call back like they said and they lie and tell you someone's co.ing back when they aren't which I just knew was going to happen, trash trash trash always have a problem with them always!!"
"Do not use UPS
I sent a parcel with UPS I measured my items before packing, which measured 250cm x 80cm x 80cm then packed and sent the cost was approximately £36 I didn’t see the need to take pictures, I was the given a surcharge extra of an additional £146 because the packaging was more than what I had noted, the actual cost of the returning goods were only £77 way way over the top, learnt a lesson on not to use courier’s bin it or return it back in person,"
"The incompetence and irritation of UPS is just mind boggling. Package was supposed to delivered Friday, but it required a signature which I was not aware of. Delivery driver came when I wasn't home. Left a note saying the package was left at the nearest UPS dropoff/pickup site. But it wasn't it was taken back to the sorting facility to sit there all weekend so then it could be (hopefully) taken back to the dropoff site and left there. UPS service is a steaming pile of worm -laden crap."
"If I could give minus five stars, I would. The driver could not find the address because the street number was allegedly incorrect. however, other drivers UPS were able to find this address, it's a huge apartment complex, UPS cars arrive every day.Just bums."
"UPS LOST my PACKAGE and BLAMED ME for it. I called UPS because there were no tracking details online on 11/3 for a package with an expected delivery of 11/4. I called back on 11/4 and was told that my Package was lost in transit and an investigation was started. I checked with my local UPS and the store account owner told me I should have not called UPS and that it was my fault the package was not going to be delivered - he stated that because of me calling and UPS starting an investigation to locate the package, ""the package will get there, when it gets there"". Terrible customer service - Would NOT Recommend."
"For the second time this week I did not get a package. The first package has been sitting at the facility since Oct. 29. The package today says it was delivered at 5.30. I got the notice at 6.35, wen downstairs, no package. Customer service said the would contact the driver and he would come back and help me find the package. You guessed it. It has not happened. Why can the driver not ring the doorbell? Amazon and Fedex do! The worst delivery company out there. Should fire everyone from the top down."
"The driver somehow decided that the apartment number was not in the address, when it CLEARLY was. I then spent two days making phone calls and having them lie to me, promising it would be delivered within 6 hours of each phone call, and that they would call me as soon as it had been delivered. Well, it has not been delivered, I have received no phone calls following through, and now they’re saying they can’t deliver until Monday, because today is now Friday. The package should have arrived Wednesday morning(I paid for their “expedited” delivery)!!!!I will NEVER use UPS again, and will refrain from using companies that partner with them as well. What a joke of a company."
"UPS has the worst work ethic of any organization I've ever seen. The delivery driver didn't bother to try delivering a package to my apartment complex 5 times, listing it as undeliverable. Their tracking number indicated it was at the distribution center so I had to haul my ass over there myself to find it. I was told to go over there, and when I got there they said it had already been sent back to the sender. All I got was a ""sorry!"" and when I complained about the driver another ""sorry!"". What the hell!? Who is doing their job?!"
After making a purchase the tracking indicated the package would arrive on Thursday 11/3/22 between 3:00pm - 7:00pm. I arrived home from work at 1:200pm to find the package had already been delivered. The tracking indicated it would arrive at my home again the following day between 4:00pm and 7:00pm. I took a half day vacation from work arriving home at 12:30pm to find they had already tried to deliver the package at 11:30am. This is 4 1/2 hours early. Now the package is being returned to sender saying no one was home to sign. Called customer service. The first person basically told me ‘too bad so sad’ and that there was nothing they could do. I made her connect me with someone higher. That person tried to contact the truck several times saying they weren’t answering the phone. They told me they would keep trying and call me back to let me know when the package would be brought back today since it is still on the truck. Of course I never received a call back. What HORRIBLE service! Very sad!
Slowest shipping I have ever seen ordered or 31 was told 2 days an package went through my state to a different state an has been sitting in there hub for over 24 hrs 2 days has turned into 6 days an they say will ve 3 more days this is bad business
It’s impossible to get anything from UPS. The absolute worst
"U P S has sent my parcel back to Poland without presenting me with an invoice or giving me a chance to pay. First delivery man who came didn't give me an invoice and asked for a big payment by card!!! He said he would return to me once I've figured out what I was paying for.... Next thing I hear is that my parcel has been returned to my supplier....the following day, I received an invoice... I called the company and they were not helpful at all she just told me to call my supplier as its gone back to a Poland.... Crazy!!"
"The driver pulled up to the house and didn't even get out. After 2 minutes he drove away. Customer services said he would contact the driver and he would call back when the package was delivered. Then it changed the delivery status to the next business day, with a note on the customer's request. LIARS"
Delivery is always late and if you try to call them to change delivery they don't really care.
"Ordered 2 IPhones being shipped from PA with 2 day air. Because signature was required, I paid my $5.99 and asked to hold package at UPS since I wouldn't be home that day. Stopped at UPS on Monday (the day they were available for pickup) and was told by the very disorganized, easily distracted UPS agent that, oh no, it looks like my package was never shipped. I held up my phone and showed them the information that showed it was picked up and scanned twice. I was told I had to use the UPS tracking. I pointed out I was on UPS.com. Then had the most frustating 1.25 hours on the phone trying to get them to change the package from will hold to delivery (I work remote and would be home). I finally hung up with no resolution. Called 3 hours later and was able to change it. I have now found out that my package was indeed shipped, but, they shipped it to Kentucky and not NH. Day of delivery comes. I am working from home, my husband came home early, and we are both home with 2 cars in the driveway. At 4:30, I go out to get the mail, and there is a ""Sorry we missed you"" sticker on my door. How the heck do you miss us when we are clearly home, our doorbell works, and there is a wooden door that you could Knock on. My 2 day shipping took 6 days. I did learn that one way to get past that irritating, useless, non helpfull robotic virtual assistant....When they ask how to help you, the correct answer is COMPLAINT. Instantly transferred to a person who was just as inept as the virtual assistant."

"I wish I could give a zero. Sadly I cannot, but I will never understand the need to drive 60 on a street with animals and children running about. One of your drivers was going way too fast and hit my puppy today. Worst feeling ever to hear a thunk and have to go outside and see a UPS truck speeding off while MY PUPPY bleeds out in the street in front of my other animals and me. I will never stay silent to the UPS drivers around here again. If I see one going faster than 30 I will be saying something there is no excuse for what I have been having to go through today because of a reckless driver. Horrible people. If I would have had to pick my puppy up and someone hadn't been kind enough to stop to help me when they saw me crying over my dead dog in the street I would have done something evil when that truck came back through. Teach your drivers respect, didn't honk or anything just kept driving way too fast. Came back through and I was still crying on my front porch just stared at me as he drove by."
"UPS has the worst delivery team. It's been multiple times that they have lost packages from vendors and ultimately say that customers cannot fight a claim. They have irresponsible deliverers who can just lose packages including iPhones. How could you lose a package when it is being scanned and tracked at every step?
Please hire reponsible and reliable team members.
Thieves."
"F.cking ups lost my package for 1200 dol!!!!!
It was La mer creams inside
Says delivered in locker
But I never get a code from locker"
Terrible customer service. Have called 4 times this week. Promised returned phone call every time. But of course no one ever calls you back. Case has been updated to the top level. Still no call. The box is only up the road from me but they haven't the brains to put the correct delivery address sticker on it and deliver it. Iv informed them every time of the correct address but still no use. 11 days to go 2 hrs by van. What a joke. My DHL package came from China in 48 hrs. Delivered hassel free.
"We live in a fairly simple to navigate street our house has the actual street name on the front of it and yet twice now UPS has delivered to the wrong street. Luckily for us the neighbours are trustworthy and have brought our package containing expensive items round to us. We have no issues with Royal Mail, DPD, FedEx or Evri so why can the UPS driver not read a sat nav?"
"Terrible customer service, want to charge to have package picked up at location because driver doesn’t read signature slips they leave the day before."
hot men kissing
"I ordered my item on October 23,2022 and received a message from UPS it would arrive October 26, didn't come, here it is November 1 and still don't have it. I was researching and according to UPS the address was wrong and the package has been sitting in their warehouse a few miles from my home since Oct 26! The address with the online store was correct, UPS had the address correct when stated would be delivered on Oct 26, at what point did it go wrong? Now email states ""address is corrected, is on its way"" never even got a call from anyone. UPS has gotten to be the so crappy anymore. Boxes look like they've been dropped kicked to the front door, terrible."
"You can't submit a claim?! Everytime i tried to submit a claim for my package that is apparently ""lost"" it says an error occured. Then when you try to contact customer support you get a robot and if you say ""report a problem"" it tells you to check online on ups website, then hangs up the phone. If you try a different option on the phone it says that a representative can't submit a claim for you. How the hell do you submit a claim then??!!"
Sevice is garbage. You'll leave all your info. And still won't get your parcel. They shouldn't even charge for They service. It seems they don't even make a attempt to deliver. That's why I prefer FedEx. And I wouldn't gave them a star but I couldn't give a review.
"UPS has no customer service agents available by phone, and their web site does not permit the customer to update claims information on the web site. Since UPS has no customer service agents available by phone and their system does not permit updates to claims - they never know the status of the claim reported by the customer.

UPS is without question, the most screwed up shipping company there is! DO NOT USE UPS - YOU WILL REGRET IT! IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH YOUR SHIPMENT!!!"
They never call or deliver my product. and they say I refuse for delivery. And now I again have to pay for delete very fee...and this can happen again...it's a scam guys never trust UPS
"Booked a parcel online for delivery to my cousins in Australia, hand knitted, (by my wife), woollen toys.
Completed all the requested details on line and payment taken. Firstly, when dropping of at local shop, parcel not accepted!!! No “Commercial Invoice”???
Phone call to UPS Customer Service, all details of contents repeated, new shipment number given and assured all ok. Parcel “On the Way”
Next day, email from UPS local depot, stating parcel held “Clearance Information Required”!!!!!
Phone call again, “Commercial Invoice” required!
What is a “Commercial Invoice” to do with home made items??? And why does the on-line booking not make any mention of it???
Appalling service, we have never had any problems sending gifts to Australia before with other couriers.
We asked for parcel to be returned to use and a refund, we will see what happens. I will update review after."
"Thanks for ruining Halloween UPS. You had a month to deliver our costumes. You are now my son and my daughters mortal enemy. I vow to teach them the skills of pettyness and spitefulness, to forever be a thorn in your side. Be warned, one day they will be coming for your unprofessional, incompetent behinds."
"The level of disrespect I've recently had to endure from UPS is something I promise I'll never forget, but UPS sure will because they don't even care to make logs when you have an open, unresolved case with them.
They literally don't care about you as a client. They have nothing to lose by not delivering on the one function they have in society. They already stole your money, why did you think they would do the decent thing and refund it? Do you not know how a scam works???
How many times do I need to have the same conversation with an employee of theirs before I randomly meet someone who is willing to make the tiniest effort to resolve my issue? At least make a log?

Oh we beg the, billion dollar company, help a poor peasant in need. We are obviously not worthy."
I DON'T LIVE IN THE BLOODY US I NEED TO CHANGE ME DELIVERY IN THE UK WHAT A JOKE OF A PORTAL SYSTEM YOU HAVE PLEASE PUT UK ON YOUR ADDRESS LIST
"Delivery attempt was not made! Usually other carriers use the call box so they can enter the building!
Called customer service they said that the carrier’s never uses the apt. call box that is not part of their job!
That’s so bs becauseI see other ups carriers using the call box to enter the building!! So unacceptable excuse!"
"Wish I could rate zero. Had issues with the UPS store near me because the owner wouldn’t print me a tracking receipt for my package. You know.. to kind of prove that my package has been received and that they will handle it?? Instead, the guy spends the next 5 mins arguing with me, telling me to put the package next to the counter and leave - no receipt, nothing. There’s no one even at the store so it’s not like they’re busy; I just want my damn receipt!! Contacting head office does nothing. They’ll always pass the blame to anyone but themselves, saying their locations are franchised and that they have no control over malpractice. Sheesh.. what a company."
"The issue I've been having is a previous homeowner still using my home address for their packages. UPS is good at delivering but there is no way to attach a note regarding my address to auto-return to sender any name not associated with the current address. Do they not have a way to attach notes whenever a package gets scanned for delivery that uses an incorrect address? I've had these previous mail and packages that just won't stop being delivered! Then UPS needs to come and get the package later which is repetitious and redundant for them. Why can't I associate a message for the delivery scanners that when they see a name not authorized for an address that it goes into the return to sender bin?! They don't have to deliver it, I don't have to wait on hold for lengthy wait times for pickup and the stooges who don't know how to change their address get to wait as their package stays in limbo.

That's my gripe. Something needs to be done here. This is mail fraud and I'm tired of sending it back. It's MY address ffs! Not theirs!!

UPS needs to up their game with other people using addresses they have no permission to use!! That's bogus!!

Other than this boring and repetitious issue, they delivered the stuff I ordered pretty well. Things showed up fast.

I don't like their new delivery shenanigans with people using their own vehicles. Anybody can do that and that opens up people's properties to potential issues. I saw the ad for that temp job. I don't want double the amount of people traipsing on my property for a seasonal gig. I don't mind the brown trucks because they seem more likely to stick with their jobs longer. I had 2 young men parked in my driveway today visiting and taking their time. Neither were wearing UPS clothing. In the ad, it said drivers would be required to do that. It's not the same professionalism that I've experienced with the guys in the brown outfits with the brown trucks. I want the brown trucks only at my residence! Can I request that?

Lose the temp drivers please! It's not the high quality experience I've gotten to know your company for."
"Place is a piece of s***- made me drop a college course, and come up here twice only to say I am not on the list! Complete chaos, unprofessionalism, and lack of structure"
Kahli was very professional and he helped us in no time. I’ve had troubles at other ups stores but now I know where to come for great service.
"I'd give this delivery service zero stars if that we're an option. I've already lost $250 within a couple of months with UPS. GOOD LUCK trying to get in touch with someone at their corporate office or any assistance at their office pick-up/drop-off locations! They shipped my package off somewhere in California and cannot get in touch with anyone there either. I requested ""no signature"" for drop offs and they did not drop it off, shipped it back to warehouse in CA and now i've lost out on $250. I will not be ordering from any sites that use UPS as their delivery service, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Horrible service. I recently had to send my drone in for repairs. The drone was repaired and I received an e mail from the company stating the drone had been shipped out 2 day air. On the third day, I get a call from UPS wanting an address verification because the driver stated, no such address. We have a small business and we get deliveries CONSTANTLY from UPS, so instantly I knew something was up. 3 days after that I get an e mail from UPS and the repair facility stating the package was delivered. I live in the middle of the country on an acre of ground with no neighbors, my wife was home and outside working all day. She went in the house 5 minutes before the time UPS said the package was delivered. I searched the entire property, twice. It is an expensive item and it was drizzling. No package was there anywhere. I contacted UPS and the repair facility and both told me the package was delivered. The next morning, UPS delivers around 4pm normally, my wife hears a strange noise and goes to the window. There is no vehicle in sight but laying along side the road out by the mailbox is the package with the drone."
Missed my package by an hour because you can’t get any relevant info of what time it’s coming. So they said they were sending it to a hub which i did not approve all the way across town. If it was overnight shipping why is why send it to a hub then the next day it’s still not at the hub. Don’t use them they suck
"Poor customer service is an understatement.

These people have no idea what they are doing. I spelled out the address 4 times, and they still got it wrong. The automated system is awful, and hangs up on me 3 out of 4 times. The ""international department"" phone number, is not the international department. Reps have no information on what is actually going on, and every rep has a different reason for every question you ask."
"So apparently my previous review was removed for being harmful. Well let me be perfectly clear, I will exercise my right to speak free and if that causes harm then so be it. But under no circumstances will UPS continue to “lose”, steal nor waste my day because they refuse to follow directions and deliver my packages after I signed a release package form. There is absolutely no reason I should have to track my own package down because so moron over at ups is refusing to follow instructions. So let’s recap if I have to wait outside my home and inflect harm on a driver I WILL. I pay you dusty, dirty asoles to deliver to me. Not the other way around and if you’re unable to do the job at hand leave it the real one like FEDEX who get the job done every single time! Sick baztards up at UPS should be ashamed of yourselves."
"Total screw up didn't deliver package to my 97 year old mother, my 75 year old sister spent 60 dollars for a taxi to pick the package up, finally phoned me at 7 o'clock in the morning and woke up the whole family to say there sorry. I'll never use them again"
"Terrible! The worst experience ever! No customer service at all. They send an email about the delivery and then they don't show up. (I have lost day off, benzine, highway fee and 7h of my life). Last minute they change the delivery day and h in the system (so of course I can't leave everything and run the same day), than they leave it somewhere, when you call them if the point is open next day - they say yes - and you drive for nothing because it's closed. This company is a joke. I hope not to be forced to use their 'service' ever again"
"UPS has lost my most important packages over and over in the last year. Twice on my trade show items that I need to have. Their claims process is horrible. They lost my expensive package, then make it difficult to file a claim. Absolutely miserable customer support - especially for a company like mine that uses them daily. I hope to make a switch to Fed Ex."
"Well ,again ,3rd horrible review, different issue same company.
So why can any other company delivery my packages but ups never can. Worst for western service. They send a person with such a thick accent that nobody at home ,when the parcel came ,could understand what he was saying. I hate you with such passion you can't believe it !"
"Awful experience sending a parcel abroad. Due to Morrocco Customs; They refused to deliver, asked the recipient to travel 1500 miles to collect. When he couldn't they threatened to destroy the parcel worth £650, without giving me the option to have it back. Now one month on i physically had to visit the Casablanca office to get ups Casablanca to talk to ups Europe. Customs completely ruined my suprize gift and made it an Absolute nightmare. Still no sign of the parcel being returned (I think someone in customs liked it too much, as they won’t let it go, they want to keep my property).they never given a total for the charges even after 30 days of holding the parcel."
I SENT A PACKAGE OUT ON 10/22/2022 AND THE PERSON DIDN'T RECEIVE IT UNTIL 10/31/2022..UPS IS THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE PLUS THEY NEVER UPDATE THE TRACKING SO YOU ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHEN YOUR GETTING YOUR PACKAGE... COMPLETE JOKE🥴
"MY HUSBAND HAD HEART MEDICINE DELIVERED VALUED AT OVER $1500. THE DRIVER SCANNED THAT IT WAS DELIVERED TO OUR FRONT PORCH BUT HE TUCKED IT BEHIND A WOOD FENCE 300 FT NE OF OUR HOUSE BECAUSE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO DELIVER IT TO THE FRONT PORCH. AFTER 9 DAYS OF THE RUN AROUND, THE DRIVER RETURNED TO SHOW ME WHERE HE PUT THE PACKAGE. WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE SCANNED IT DELIVERED TO THE FRONT PORCH - HE SAID THE FENCE WAS NOT AN OPTION. I HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR FOR SAMPLES IN THE MEANTME AND SPENT 9 DAYS SEARCHING 20 ACRES AND ASKING NEIGHBORS FOR MY PACKAGE. HE DELIVERED OUR NEIGHBORS IN A CEDAR TREE ACRES FROM THEIR HOUSE. NEXT TIME I WILL PAY THE $10 FOR FED-EX TO DELIVER TO MY HOUSE. THEY DO AN EXCELLANT JOB!! IF USPS WAS AN OPTION I WOULD USE THEM. UPS HAD NO COMMENT AFTER THE PACKAGE WAS FOUND. IF I WAITED ON THEM MY HUSBAND WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF MEDICINE AND HAD A HEART ATTACH. HOPE THEY LOOSE THE CONTRACRT WITH TOI PHARMACY - THEY DON'T DESERVE IT. USPS WOULD DO A BETTER JOB AND WOULD BE CHEAPER."
The ladies there were Very professional and so friendly and helpful!! When I got there the line was pretty long but I was in and out within 10 mins and so very satisfied!! Now that’s customer service!! Thank you!!
"If I could give stars in Minus I would that for UPS. I sent a pakage they deliver it and I asked please go on specific date so someone is available at home but they do the delivery two time before that when I did not even ask for and said 3 delivery attempts are made. The I scdule a deliver for october 3 and they told me yes it will get deliver on the oct 3 I give them call the whole day they just kept giving me wrong info every time. I asked them to pass on to the supervisor they DID NOT AT ALL LIKE I AM GETTING DIFFERENT ANSWERS FROM EVERY ONE. At last after 3 hours of hold supervisor tells me parcel is in the truck and will deliver by 8:00pm. I call them at 8:00 and they tells me no delivery are made after 7:00. WORST EXPEREIENCE EVERR IN MY LIFE. I ASKED FOR REFUND COZ I DID NOT PAY 60$ TO GET MY PARCEL BACK TO ME AND BE ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR COMPANY WHOLE 3 DAYS. I call them after i recieve my pacakge and they tell me call after 15 days refund is under review and I call after a month they have not even apply for a refund.

My second delivery the driver comes to my home does not even ring a bell coz and I was at home after 5 min I go out there is a notice of no one was available. LIKE UPS GET YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND DRIVERS STRAIGHT.

IF YOU GUYS CANNOT WORK OUT STRAIGHT JUST CLOSE MANN FEDEX IS WAY BETTER."
"Don’t use UPS never again! UPS is totally rubbish from the delivery, customer service etc."
"My package was due to arrive Thursday, then changed to Friday, tracking showed it went from Illinois to the destination (Colorado Springs) on Friday, then went back to Illinois and said delivery date would be Saturday. Now says package is in Monument Colorado and no delivery date available. Customer service is of no help, and the ""chat"" is useless as well. I finally got a live person after many tries and she said it is scheduled to be delivered today, yet tracking says no date available. Conflicting information of where it will be delivered (residence which I requested) or an access point possibly to have to pick up. This is the absolute worst carrier I have ever used!!!!!"
"Their customer service is horrible, they don’t have direct answers, UPS likes to point the finger to others besides themselves. They don’t update their tracking service and worst of all when you ask them a legitimate question they yell at you and hang up on you."
If I could leave a zero I would. The worst!
"This is the third case of wine that just vanished. Had a delivery window, someone at the house the entire time, never arrived. The shipper now says ""UPS has no idea where your wine is."" Good shippers, all squared away. But UPS just SUCKS!"
"This has been the worst service every, No return calls at all, I had to keep reaching out to them. When my 23 boxes were delivered the guy delivering them did not take them down from the truck, refused to bring them down lucky I had help.
And out 24 boxes they lost one, 4 boxes were destroy everything in them was broken. It has taken 2 months for them to pay out and not close to what was broken or lost. No apologies I spoke to someone that stated workers don’t care about how they place them they just throw them no matter what happens. I will let everyone I know about my experience."
Package was never received suppose to receive on 10/26 today is 10/29 still don't receive anything and never contact me about it also they never put any update. Very Bad experience this company is not responsible.
"This company use to deliver packages now i have to pick up my package since ""they didnt find anyone home"" first of all i live right by the entrance i was outside around the time of the ""attempted"" delivery the driver just didnt want to deliver the package because there is a gate .First fed ex continuously pulls this bs now ups im just glad amazon makes on time DELIVERIES yes deliveries as in i do not need to pick it up thats how its done ups/fed ex take notes."
"I ordered a package from Amazon that got sent through UPS. Instead of UPS saying that my package is undeliverable to my address and the sender telling me to update my shipping address, UPS accepted my package. My package made it all the way Tennessee when UPS sent me an email saying there was an issue in delivering my package. When I called UPS I was informed that they would not deliver my package to my address. They also told me that they were unable to reroute my package. They gave me two options. One.. I could either drive over an hour away to go pick it up at the UPS store or they would have to send the package back. I work a full-time job and I don't have the time to drive an hour and half away. I ended up having to leave work early to go pick up my package. The UPS lady who helped me was very nice. When I told her what happened she asked why they wouldn't reroute my package. She said they should have done that. I'm very mad at UPS. They are not helpful at all. I never use UPS again!!!"
"Yesterday I stayed home all day to receive my wife's iPhone. At 523 p.m. UPS sent a text saying the delivery was attempted and was headed back to fort worth. I was here, my wife was here the kids were here and the dogs didn't bark. I ran to the door and there was no note.

I called ups and almost the entire call the rep took a hard line. I want b there for v deliver y , period. Until I said, isn't there supposed to be a note? And aren't they supposed to take a picture of it. All of a sudden she flipped like b the first part of the call never happened. She said I am contacting the dispatcher because delivery was not attempted. She told me I would get a call back within the hour. An hour and a half later I call back. By now I have gotten a text saying I also refused delivery. I have to tell the story over and this rep apologized and said I would get a call from the facility manager first thing in the morning, she promises. She v also b says that delivery was not attempted and I didn't b refuse delivery. No call this morning.

I stayed home all day Friday. Now I'll spend Monday morning getting this straight with T-Mobile and then have to spend another day at home. The idea I have to fix this after UPS never delivered it and sent it back to Fort Worth is ridiculous. This is between UPS and TMobile.

UPS admitted twice on the phone it did not attempt delivery and I did not refuse delivery. Yet a multi-billion company doesn't take responsibility or accountability for delivering the phone and sends it to Fort Worth.

I would drag a donkey's dead body across the desert and die from heat exhaustion myself trying to deliver a package before I would pay UPS to do it. It should be pointed out that other Trust Pilot reviewers have said they experienced the same thing. My wife said there have been posts in our neighborhood group page about UPS doing this."
Package sent from east coast to Hawaii..took 3 days to get to California where it sat for another 2 days..today's tracking has it in Kentucky going the opposite direction and delivery date is in 2 days....160.00 was cost of shipping....what a waste.such a loser company...i asked the shipper not to use them bu he did anyway......update..it flew to Hawaii back to California and back to Hawaii..took 10 days and traveled almost 10000 miles to get to its destination which was 3100 miles if it sent and not messed with....
"If I could give them a ZERO stars, I would. I paid an exorbitant amount of money for 3 day select, hoping it would arrive to its destination by the 3rd day. Had I gone to USPS and used priority mail instead, I would've likely paid 1/2 the cost and the package would've arrived on the 3rd day as promised. But because I was unsure as to whether I could mail frozen baked good through USPS, I chose to mail via UPS. HUGE MISTAKE! One that I will NEVER make again. Here we are on day 4 and they can't even give me updated tracking - which by the way hasn't been updated since the day I shipped the package. I'm pretty sure by the time my recipient receives the package, the products will be inedible. A huge BOOO to UPS. Your service is sub-standard at best. SMH"
I have a local UPS store but the company says they can’t leave the package at that location and instead I have to drive an hour out of my way to pick it up plus to allow me to pick up my own package they are telling me it’s an additional $7 fee I have to pay. This makes no sense. Also the driver said they attempted delivery however nothing was left on my porch indicating they actually did. Had a similar instance with FedEx 2 weeks ago. These postal services aren’t worth 2 cents these days.
"I had an awful experience with a company from Washington State concerning a scooter my wife needed for our vacation in Pigeon Forge. Without going into great detail, the UPS facility in this area, store #2234, made my return of the scooter very simple. They went over the top to help me. The associates were Cameo, Carmela, Desi and Nick. I can't ever remember a group of folks being so willing to help me with anything. Thanks to you all.....you are masters of your craft!!"
"Failed to even attempt to deliver a package to me, blamed a new driver on not being able to locate the property despite the post code taking you right to the front door and then said that it would be delivered the next day and ,again not even attempted, on contact told the depot would phone within the hour and nothing was hear from them either."
First attempt at rug delivery failed even though we were at home. Difficult to get a clear answer from customer service hotline. Was told would be called by driver in advance of second delivery attempt but didn't happen.
"I have a package I’ve been waiting for, that I paid expedited shipping for. I bought my items for work on Saturday 10/22/22, my items were shipped Monday 10/24/22. I was supposed to receive my items Thursday 10/27/22, UPS messed up so my delivery date changed to today Friday 10/18/22. My items are not anything that need to be signed for, I live in a house with a fence, so why the driver did NOT drop my items off, I am clueless. The tracking says, “delivery attempted at 8:43am”, but again there should have been no excuse why they couldn’t drop off my package. Later in the day I call to talk to customer service, the lady says they will try to deliver my package by the end of the day, but if they cannot they will deliver on Monday. Are you kidding me? I needed this item for work and I paid extra for shipment, now it’s your companies fault and I have to wait longer. I’m very unhappy with the company’s customer service."
"My last 4 deliveries have been terrible.
They keep getting worse.
UPS sends text/emails stating a delivery date but off by average of 3 days. Getting as bad as USPS.
Each delivery will send me a text/email stating the package is out for delivery then no package and no text/email explaining why. Tracking online says delayed. How can a package be out for delivery with a given expected time even and then not be delivered.....horrible. UPS My Choice is useless as well, waste of money. 1ZA5T3520350548144 is the latest tracking number, now scheduled to come on 10/31/22...Monday. Ridiculous."
"Trustpilot, Please introduce 0 stars for this company"
"UPS was supposed to be delivering my sons birthday present next day. Guess what, they were late getting the package to their facility and blamed it on a sorting problem, I see the time stamp of when it arrived, do you think people are stupid? If I had a choice i would have gone with fed-ex, but i didn't have a choice. Its Friday and now it wont be delivered until monday, and i only have my son for this weekend and wont be able to give him his present for 2 more weeks. Thanks for ruining my sons birthday. I would never use UPS if I had a choice."
"UPS is the worse don't trust them with expensive items. Driver lied about dropping it off at the front desk , I don't have a front desk. they never responded to my claim.
I never received my iPad"
"Moved here from WA last year. The UPS service in Reno vs Vancouver are night and day. In Reno, every single pkg delivered has not followed the simple instructions on address label. ""Put in lockbox: code ____"". It would take 10 seconds! In Vancouver I received all packages without one single hiccup in 6 yrs. Here in Reno for less than one year and it has become almost like a tragic comedy. I installed a lockbox because when I first moved here, pkgs were getting stolen. I have taken all their steps and jumped through their hoops in trying to fix this. Now I'm working with the company that uses UPS to use someone else. It's medicine for my dog and so it's VERY important that I get these. I even spoke with a driver that was here delivering, and told him the code and he wrote it in a notepad... Before every delivery, I've talked to customer service reps via chat, email, (and tried calling the phone # which was hilariously inefficient!). They all promised this would not happen again. And yet..."
"I was home all day, waiting for my package and yet somehow they missed me. The next day, I waited at home, again all day, because the items being delivered are very important. Here it is 5:15 pm and I STILL don't have my package. I signed up for a premium account for better tracking but no additional estimation was provided. Refusal to provide tracking / delivery estimates ARE a form of poor service."
Overnight package was delivered almost a week late. The package was ripped open and contents removed prior to delivery. Customer Service is giving me the run around.
"The first day, I was at home ALL DAY, the delivery man didn't knock or ring the doorbell, but he did have the time to leave a note, saying ""Sorry, we missed you"". My family doesn't live outside of our front door. ""We'll redeliver tomorrow and you can sign the back of this note."" So I signed the back of the note and taped it on the door, the next day around 10 am, I got an email stating my package will be delivered to my address before 7 pm, then 2 hours after, two more emails stating my package is ready to be picked up at the local UPS store. I drove to the store, and I was told the package wasn't there... How is this company in business?! I'm amazed."
"Unprofessional, dishonest, corruptive business. No descent business should be dealing with UPS. Everyone should be aware of their tactics, and no one should be using this service. If people speak up then this business should close down for real. Enough is enough. Claimed they came but they never did. Charged an absurd fee. Lied in my face."
"I made an international shipment, since August and it did not reach the hands of the receiver , I was communicating with customer support and they were bouncing me from one person to another and nobody solved anything. My package never arrived, I did not recover my package or my money. I do not recommend anyone to use this service, they are irresponsible."
"I wish I could give a zero star rate , they stole my package and claimed they delivered it. First they said it was delivered to my address then they said it was left at a pickup point I went to go pick the package up at the pick up point and guess what they never delivered it there, mind you this is my medication and I haven’t received my package till date, bunch of thieves and liars."
Every turn with this company is awful. Customer service is a joke. Automated phone system will hang up on you. Call representative cant help with anything. Not open on weekends when you pay for overnight delivery. Distribution center only open 9am-1230pm for pickups. Rates are outrageous.
UPS delivered to the wrong address and it wasn`t signed for. I have had a previous problem with UPS. I will never use UPS ever again
"Website stated package was in my city early afternoon to arrive by 7 pm same night. Package never arrived. Called costumer service at 8:30pm. Rep said package to arrive next day. Spoke to local facility the next day and was told the truck leaves everyday at 9 am so my package would not have been on the truck and “driver can’t go crack to the office to pick up one package!” This is understandable, however, if they know this, then make the website reflect the correct delivery date!!!!"
"Delivery, return and customer service all terrible for anything that requires a signature. The web site gives a time for delivery and it could be a day earlier or day later and then “failed” because you’re not home to sign. Packages that don’t require signature seem to work. Anything that weighs over a 100 pounds is sure to be damage after it’s dropped (4 times so far)."
"UPS is TRASH.

One of the questions that were asked was, what went wrong this time when it should have been what went wrong every time? And had UPS itself answer. Well, my answer is, they are LAZY and LIARS. They had us wait for about THREE WEEKS before my husband CAUGHT one quickly sneaking out after delivery so he wouldn't have to pick up the box that was seating right there on the steps, and when my husband caught up with him, he had the NERVES to tell him another driver was going to come later one to take it. My husband said, hell, no, you need to take that box with you and was serious about it. Guess what? He asked my husband for the mailing label, and when my husband asked what label, he said, oh the one UNDER the package I delivered. My husband was SHOCKED, and when he looked it was there, meaning the driver PURPOSELY hid and attached it under the package he had just delivered so he would not pick it up. I realized it was because the box I was returning to Wayfair was heavy and they all did not want to take it. He's so lucky I wasn't there, I’d have given him a piece of my mind and recorded the whole thing. Now, we're going through the same thing with a small package I have to return to Amazon. That's my experience with them. My daughter who had just given birth was in her kitchen when one came, rang the bell once, and tried to leave within 30 seconds, and when she caught up with him, his excuse was, oh, I didn't think anyone was home, that's when my daughter said, well, maybe if you had waited more than 30 seconds you would have known that someone was home. The second time, when she had a package to be picked up by another driver, all he did was stuck the “Sorry we missed you” note at her door, without even bothering to ring the bell, and when she caught up with him and confronted him about it, he was standing there, stuck on stupid, looking at her and not knowing what to say. I use to complain to Amazon about NOT wanting its company, Amzel Logistics to deliver my packages because they are ALWAYS late, sometimes days late, I guess I’ll take my chances with them from now on. UPS is simply TRASH."
"Next day letter not delivered. Current status shows delivery a full day late. Actions to follow-up, request updates on delays, etc, all to no avail.

Will never use again. Use FedEx."
Prompt delivery. Great communication on arrival time. Great sevice
"Good day,
pardon my words but what a bad service UPS provides. First, I need to register/ open an UPS online account to change the way of delivery. I do not want an account, seems totally unneccessary, as it works just fine without for most other delivery services. Second, after logging in, it is said that I can't change the delivery date/form immediately, oh cool, then the deliverer will not meet me at home and bring it to a shop. Since I literally got an UPS store in my house, guess what I expected. Of course, my 20kg parcel was brought to another shop and it was said that I can pick it up the day after. So I went the next day to find that the parcel was not in the shop. Nice one."
"The package was delivered elsewhere but they argued that we received it. We had to go through Amazon where we purchased the items to get a refund. We then opened an investigation through UPS to find out where our items were actually sent. This investigation is ongoing. I really don’t understand why any company or business continues yes to use UPS, they suck!!!"
"The signature in person sucks, I waited for hours one day, four or five notices later I finally ran into the ups driver and just got my package yesterday"
Horrible service. Did not deliver my package twice in a row. Extremely difficult to get a hold of as well as providing claims that are basically not possible to submit so that they do not have to do with their problem. Disgusted with their service.
"Had several bad experiences with UPS: didn't deliver at the correct location, didn't deliver the package, damage the package, and also one pickup guy is very rude, banging on the door instead of ringing the bell and yelling in front of the house! They should get proper training for this such big company!"
"Sorry to say, but ups just live the items even though if you are there. They should use another technique. On this days I can't believe that they could find a house. Amazon or other companies should think before use UPS"
"Would give zero stars if I could. They don't actually deliver packages, they pretend to, put a sticker on your door that they had 3 unsuccessful delivery attempts (despite never actually calling you because the drivers don't carry cell phones) and that you have to go all the way to them to get the package now. Basically, off-loading the entire concept of ""delivery"" to the customer. They should just be transparent that they are an inconvenient drop-off service, not a delivery service."
"The driver started to pass my house, then proceeded to deliver my package to the neighbor's house. I have it all on our security cameras. That caused a huge mess with our neighbor because by the time we got our package in our possession, he had opened it and didn't bother to bring it to us until we asked him about it and he said he left it in our mailbox instead of bringing it to our door. He was probably afraid we'd say something about it being opened. I'm sure if it had been something he wanted to keep, he would've lied and said he didn't have it. UPS delivers to us on a pretty frequent basis especially during the holidays, so I don't understand why he didn't know where he was supposed to deliver our package today. I even put a permanent message in my UPS profile stating the color of the house because it's the only one in our whole neighborhood that color."
"I used this service three times: the first time was without any problem, the second the driver didn’t call us but insisted that he did. When we proved that he didn’t, UPS delivered our parcel. Today it was the most awful case - without calling us they wrote that the customer wasn’t available during delivery time and put our parcel into self pick up point. I was trying to solve my problem, but I was only transferred from one operator to another. So, it was last time when I used this service."
"My Iphone 14 was supposed to be in my hand October 26th. I watched the UPS truck on the tracking app ride right pass my house and deliver up the road to 5 West apartments. Something is fishy about this especially since they delivered my phone case but not my phone. Today still no package plus now I can't track my package and there isn't no update. Don't order any electronics and have them shipped through UPS. I'm filing a police report first thing in the morning.

I went to the facility today (October 27th) where my phone was processed (5201 Eagle Trail Dr). They tried to give me the call the customer service phone number run around until I told them that my phone case was delivered but not my phone. Then when I mention getting law enforcement involved, the manager comes out the back to see which driver delivered my phone case when I was told that they have no way of knowing which truck my phone was loaded on. Then the manager send the person that was at the counter to tell me that my iphone is missing instead of coming to tell me himself. I called the customer service number. I was told they were going to contact the shipping manager then call me back. That was a lie. No one called me back. I'm going to post this ordeal on social media. I'm willing to bet that I'm not the only person that had my package taken by one of their employees.


Update: 11-10-22
Haven't received an updates or phone calls from UPS even though I filed a claim. I guess corporate doesn’t care their company conducts business. I urge people to use other carriers especially during the holidays. Do not trust UPS unless you want your stuff stolen. UPS knows they have sticky finger bandits working in their organization."
"Not sure how anyone could use this, after one week parcel didn't even leave the pick-up location and the status stayed the same ""label created"". Now the investigation is ongoing because they have no idea where it is... This was my first and last time using UPS services in UK."
"Wow such a negative rating is hard for me to believe because I've NEVER encountered a problem with UPS! Now FEDEX actually STOLE my grandsons PS 5 and put a jumbo roll of FEDEX PLASTIC in the box to weigh it down. I especially want to give a SHOUT OUT to the UPS Store #6847 the employees MAJESTY and NIKO!!! They made my 7yr old grandsons day. They went out of their way to give him encouragement, told him he could be anything he wanted to be, giving him high fives, and asking him about his grades in school. WOW!!! it is so imperative we give the children of today encouragement in such a world that seems to be spiralling out of control at an unprecedented rate."
"Stop using UPS. Earlier this month I was harassed by a UPS driver on the road. As I drove at the speed limit toward my home, he flew up the road behind me well over the limit. He then began tailgating me at a very unsafe distance. When I slowed behind a turning car in front of me, he attempted to pass us by driving on the shoulder but did not have enough room. That led to him blasting his horn at me. He then continued tailgating me until I turned on my directional indicating a turn into my driveway. He then crossed a double-solid line to pass me illegally on the left, nearly side-swiping my car. I decided to follow him to get his license but was unable to catch him even though I was driving 10 miles over this speed limit of 25 mph because he was driving so fast. Luckily, I caught up with him at a traffic light and got his license plate number. I approached his truck and told him I was filing a complaint against him. He bragged, “You won’t be the first or the last.” That’s how confident he was he would not be held accountable for his reckless driving. He was right. I immediately filed a complaint through the UPS website. Within a day I received a message stating, “Thank you for contacting UPS back, I have successfully sent an urgent message to the UPS center, and we can take action as soon as possible for this inconvenience. I see you will be contacted by the UPS center via email for additional action, and commitments related to this incident.” Since then, I have heard nothing. Repeated emails have also been ignored. Now I am seeing ads encouraging people to become “Hero UPS Drivers.” UPS clearly cares more about cowering to their union and drivers than they do about public safety and customer complaints. Boycott UPS. Use DHL, FedEx or the USPS. Do not do business with this company."
"Log in problems, problems with changing deliveries, they seem to have consistently technical issues on their homepage"
"Worst shippment company ever!!! I placed an online order which was supposed to be delivered with UPS. The order was splitted in two. One order was delivered to the neighbors but they said it was delivered to me so it took me 3 days to find where it was and the second package never arrived. Same story, they said it was delivered to the address. When I called the customer service they said it was delivered to me and they can’t do anything. As a friendly advice, never use this company if you want to receive your packages!!"
I received a delivery from UPS A hour ago. The box was smashed. Inside was a cast iron pot that was broken. This was a birthday gift for my daughter. We was both so angry. She had planned on using it tonight. Can’t use with the whole side gone. I think UPS needs to replace this and give me my money back. This is total crap. The only way to bust cast iron is throwing it hard.
"UPS lost packages four times over the past year, and they never offered refund or contacted me. I have no idea how they keep losing my packages!!! Terrible customer services! I am not gonna use it again. F UPS!!!!!!!!!!!! Go to hell!!!!!! Go bankrupt soon!!!!!!"
"I would like to know if ups management is encouraged to stay at hilton based hotels. Especially since one of their married, district managers in Cincinnati used one in louisville and one in Cincinnati to meet my wife and at least one other woman for sexual affairs."
"Customer service - like everyone else has said - is terrible. Constant ""Were Experiencing Technical Issues"" messages when trying to do anything with their website (Which the virtual assistant constantly refers you to)
The virtual assistant hangs up on you after saying they will get you to a representative. If you're lucky enough to get an actual representative, they are less than helpful. Seeming like they have no care in the world about looking into whatever problem it is.
I come from the service industry and am always calm, polite, and supportive when interacting with customer service representatives and that usually goes a long way in making the experience helpful - not with UPS they want you off the phone the second it starts and treat you like the problem. Will never use UPS for personal use and dread when I have an item shipping from them that I dont have a say in.
This many 1 star reviews without any action on their end says something about a company. And its not good."
Was waiting all day Saturday 10/22/22 for a pick up that never happened. Was home all day. Never received a call or knock at the door. Instead they approached quietly to not having to bother with me. Second was said to be made 10/24/22 at 6:15 pm except no call no show. I wasted my time and money for services I didn't receive and the best part was that they left the slips outside in the rain where they could blow away. There needs to be accountability for your drivers. I was promised a free pickup from Amazon but haven't heard any yet on that either. You used to be a good company. Start acting like it again.
"UPS is a joke, packages still haven’t arrived days after the estimated delivery date. The website is nearly impossible to navigate and the customer service is pathetic. If you have a choice, pick anything except for ups."
"This was my first experience with this company. I was tracking my package that was showing expected delivery by the end of the day. I heard a light knock on the main door of my apartment. I rechecked the update showing delivery failed. My roommate came handed me the missed delivery slip by Ups.
What did you guys expect from us to wait for our deliveries while sitting outside our houses or apartments and waiting for you to hand out our packages??
Why don't you prefer calling or texting once if the customer provided a contact number to reach out or text instead just knocking at door once and leave a notice on door???
My recommendation just stop faking the delivery thing as you guys never deliver and we have to pick up the package from the drop-off locations whatever provided because this is the only thing I figured out after reading all the reviews about the delivery that this is not only me who missed the package because of the delivery driver who is not either provided correct instructions or not following the instructions properly.
Please make sure to call instead knocking the door that would be of great help."
"UPS its the worst company shipping. If your gonna order something make sure its not UPS delivery your package. I bought something and I even paid extra or rush delivery cause I need the package 10/26/2022 and I was tracking my package. when I went down stairs, they left a paper saying ""Sorry we missed you"". they did not rung the door bell. also I called customer service, and you want to know what's the crazy part, she told me I need to pay more money to pickup my package. I HATE THIS COMPANY.
If I could give you 0 stars, trust me I would."
"It is rare these days to see such appalling customer service. They cannot communicate across bodies of water or with each other. At best they are inept, at worst deliberately obstructive. My parcel was sent 6 weeks ago and has made it across town to their warehouse where they keep saying it will be sent on, but it hasn’t been. Soon the excuse will be they can’t because of Christmas."
"Somehow the package I sent was damaged or deliberately opened. The receiver said there was clear tape wrapped around it. The contents were not inside the envelope. I tried to file a report to UPS. The chat after telling them everything said they were sending the information and that someone would call me back. When I was called back, it was from a foreign country and the phone connection was terrible! I couldn't hear the rep for all the background noise. He said an email would be sent to me to complete and return. I never received the email so I tried to call in again. The number said I could NOT speak to a representative and closed connection. I then went on line to file the report (5th attempt!) and it said my tracking number was not valid. I'm looking right at the tracking number on my online account.

This company has become a pathetic joke."
"This is the third Time in a row the UPS guy didn’t deliver my package. He didn’t even come down my street. I was time all day the last two days raking leaves and moving stuff in the yard before winter and he was never there. They dropped my package off at an access point. Out of three packages this year they have not delivered one to me. Use USPS or fed ex.

Update… tracking says my package is at the pickup point. Went to pick it up and nobody knows where it is. It’s lost or stolen. This is unbelievable!!!!!"
"Polite, efficient, on time, perfect."
"If I could give a zero I would actually negative numbers would apply here. I started calling Saturday when my package appeared to stuck in the same location for several days. I was assured my package. That was supposed to be delivered on Friday, would be here by 11AM on Monday. Well it wasn't I called several times mo day afternoon and got a different story from everyone I talked to. Was finally informed my package had been sorted incorrectly and was now in Illinois. I am in Texas and the package had be in Texas about 4 hours from me. Anyway I was told I would have my package on Tuesday well that didn't happen. I noticed Tuesday it had been stuck for a long period again. Then all the sudden it said damaged. I called ups only to be told they don't know what happened but that they had contacted the shipper not bothering to contact me the one that had called and who's name was all over the shipment and that I would need to call the shipper for a resolution. Why would they be responsible for the resolution they didn't screw up my shipment. WORST CUSTOMER SERVIVE AWARD GOES TO.....UPS"
"On Oct 13 of this year u was sent a package with ups it arrived to destination was supposed to be turned over to usps there where thing get confusing. USPS never received package or they say they never received.I want to say I trust USPS,FedEx and UPS.This is not common probably the third time this happens .Did it get misplaced,sidetracked or maybe stolen .I tried getting in touch with UPS ,They washed there hand say they delivered package to USPS.Hopefully it turn up if it does then I will Apologize.Will be waiting."
they never bring it to your house you have to go and pick it up yourself the whole point of at-home delivery is the convenience of it arriving on your doorstep. really annoying
"Multiple times a package is marked as out for delivery, doesn't get delivered until next day. Customer service is useless because they have to read from a script to appease customers like we're all cookie cutter situations. Just expect all packages to be late by at least a day and consider it a miracle if it's actually on time."
"Mi experiencia con UPS fue la mejor sobrepasó mis expectativas envié el paquete que debía mantener el frío y fue entregado antes de la hora programada, estoy súper satisfecha con el servicio de UPS desde la señorita Stefaní que me recibió una de las oficinas de Ocala Fl. Muy profesional y luego el rastreo y la entrega del paquete en Austin Texas. Gracias UPS exelente servicio.


My experience with UPS was the best, it exceeded my expectations, I sent the package that had to be kept cold and it was delivered before the scheduled time, I am super satisfied with the UPS service from Miss Stefaní who received me at one of the offices in Ocala Fl. Very professional and then the tracking and delivery of the package in Austin Texas. Thank you UPS excellent service."
Absolutely the worst damn shipping company out there!! ABSOLUTE F****** JOKE!!
This company is a joke! You call the customer service number and never get to talk to an actual person. They dont deliver packages like they are supposed to. You call the access point and they say they don't have ups deliveries there even tho the tracking app says it's being delivered to that address plus the people there are super rude and disrespectful. How is this company still in business?
"A Great BIG 0 is what they deserve.
You call the customer service line and you get a complete run around with no resolution. The drivers can't read and don't deliver the packages to the correct address. God forbid if there is more than one complex together or even if you live in an apartment. You may never get your package. I am sure they are somewhat aware, that is why they hide behind an automated system which they have no intention on answering. I would never choose them nor would I refer them to the dump because that is the type of service they have reduced to."
"There are too many bad things about UPS customer service to list. But I'll hit the major ones:
- as a business, we have packages that go out almost daily. At least once a month the driver fails to come by and pick up for some unknown reason.
- when you call the 800# for support, it's difficult to reach a human. When you do, they are not familiar with your area of the country and often don't have the ability to fix things from the phone.
- when I call for help ordering supplies from their website, I get a recording saying ""go to our website to order supplies"" and then I get hung up on.
- did I say it was difficult to reach a human when you call? And if you don't have a tracking number, forget it - you're not talking to a human."
UPS is renowned for not caring. Do not trust this carrier with ANYTHING of importance. I had a package containing paycheck and after my employer sent overnight UPS dropped the ball and left the package in Louisville Kentucky. No explanation or efforts to make it right by shipping on next flight out. I will spend ample time to make certain I find a reputable carrier for packages of importance. DO NOT TRUST UPS EVER!!!!!!
"Worst app (incorrect app guidance, not user friendly), terrible experience- recurring “misplacement” overall negative experience!"
Received package which was crushed on one corner. Like it was thrown out of the truck.
"My order from Amazon never left the facility it came thru, although they sent messages saying there were delivery attempts, and it’s at a pick up place not near my home or where it was suppose to be delivered. It never moved from the city it came from in the tracking. No log of it making it to my city. It doesn’t look like any attempts were actually made at all. I don’t have my package after weeks of going around & round with false promises from UPS and false attempts to deliver by UPS."
"I got notified that a label had been printed, no ETA
Today, while in the rest room I heard the door bell (rare) when I got to the door I saw an old white pick up truck driving away and a note left on my door from UPS saying they will try again. No text notice no nothing!
UPS spells OOP's never, repeat never had a good experience from UPS they need to just let Fedx or USPS (never thought USPS would be better) handle this type of work. Sorry share holders, UPS is going down!!"
If I could give a zero I would. I have been trying to get in touch with a rep for 5 days. I have been hit with unexplained charges directly to my cc. And the package has been returned with no explanation. I have the app. It says someone has tried to contact me and no one has. The email and phone number is correct. Abhorrent. I’ve never been so disgusted or felt so helpless for a service I’ve paid over $1000 for.
"What a useless service! They never deliver to the address specified but always to an pickup point on the other side of town. Just today I was home with a view of the only road they can take for home delivery. Not a single UPS car all day have passed! Yet they have the gall to put a status that the customer wasn't available!
When I called customer service they had all kinds of excuses, none valid! The worst was possibly that they cant call because the drivers doesn't have a phone. As if I as a customer should care. In my view this is a a company that should not exist at all. They simply does not deliver on the service the customers pay for."
"It happened several times already. Either I'm at home or not to pick up my package, courier will never deliver it to home address but at the UPS access point.

What is the point then of entering street address and all the other relevant information so UPS can deliver a package when they always choose not to deliver to your home address?!

Very bad attitude towards customers, they do not even try to do their work.

Very dissapointed. If there was 0 they would get a big 0 for their ""effort""!!!"
"Rubbish company !!!
They keep re schedule the package 3 times and some of my deliver has been postponed like 2 weeks . Impossible to contact them as they employ bunch of muppets !!!
Ridiculous!!!"
"Lazy. Just pure lazy.

I order items from Amazon and they were to be delivered by UPS on Friday the 21st.

I went outside to check my mail and there was an UPS delivery tag on my front door. It stated that I missed the delivery and they will return for a 2nd attempt on Monday the 24th. WHAT?!! The driver never rang the bell, knocked, or just left the package.

Monday came and it would be delivered between 2pm- 6pm. Yeah about an hour after 6pm again, no knock, no bell ring, but at least they had the decency to leave the package this time.

Oh and by the way I have 2 large dogs that bark at a leaf blowing across the driveway. Apparently they didn’t hear the stealth and laziness of this driver approaching he door.

If this was the first time I might be more forgiving, however this is EVERY single time something being delivered by UPS issues occur.

I NEVER had a problem with USPS, FedEx, DHL, or Amazon deliveries…ever!

In the future when ordering items I will have to verify what delivery service they use and not to buy from businesses that use UPS."
"When you decide that you're going to become a delivery person you really have to have 2 skills. The 1st one of course is to drive. Driving is part of the deal and the other part, which is just as important is to deliver the package to the door which is ON the package itself. Well it sounds easy enough doesn't it? The driver just dropped it at a random door on my street. I had to hunt it down by going through customer service and they saw that the address that it was delivered to was not my address. So today we'll just drop it anywhere we please and consider it a job done. Absolutely ridiculous"
"They lost a 2 packages out of 10 boxes that I’ve sent, a total value of both being €8512.
They don’t answer your emails and open fictitious “investigations” to find your package and never find them and not reimburse.
I will file a legal claim through court directly."
"I use UPS to ship parcels for my company.

From May '22 till now I have had 279 separate issues regarding deliveries alone. I have been more than happy to share this with them and mentioned it at every phone call - all the agents just want to get you off the phone and do not care about your issues.

Even if you opt to have your calls recorded, if you call back they will say that there is no previous correspondence."
Sloooowww! USPS is even faster!!
"The courier decided not to call me and just delivered the package to UPS point where I need to go to take it by my own.
I paid for the delivery to bring it to my door, coz it`s up to 20kg, quite heavy...
Call center can`t help me in this case...
People, NEVER AGAIN!!!!
Don`t use this company!!!"
Order never arrived and was just droped at a UPS Point.
"I'd put 0 stars if possible. The worst delivery service there is. I have no clue why they charge for shipping if they never deliver anything to where it is supposed to go. Every single time I have to go pick up my package from a post office because they ""attempted delivery"" yet I am physically waiting by or near my door waiting to hear a knock or anything that would indicate I'm receiving a delivery. Never hear anything and out of nowhere I get a notification that my package is taken to the post office. This most recent package did not even require a signature and was never out for delivery ALL DAY. Then at 4 pm they said they attempted to deliver nearly 4 hours prior?!?! Then dropped it off at the post office on a Sunday! Now I have to wait a whole day to go and get it myself when they could just do the job they're supposed to do. If I have to wait on UPS ever again I'll cancel and reorder from literally any other service. Please shut down, you worthless money grabbing company."
I'm a wedding host and I order something and just my luck the sender used ups i tried to get him to use FedEx but she couldn't. Well I been trying to get my package for three days straight and nobody could help me. I called them four times and the wedding was Saturday night and its now Monday Sunday morning and still have not received my package still have not gonna a phone call back from anyone and when you call the customer service the agent keeps telling me that someone will call me but yet I'm fours in and still waiting. Ups always lets me down thats why I only deal with FedEx or Amazon.
"Indiguinated!! I'm waiting for a package from the SHEIN online store and my order will take a while to arrive because they say 'my apartment number is wrong or non-existent' and the amazing thing is that I already made a purchase and it arrived normally. I hope my order is delivered and that no one has stolen it (I've heard cases) because if something happens UPS will have to return the amount. I went to an in-person shop and told what happened, but they said I couldn't see much because the system wasn't working properly."
Didn't receive package. The too stupid on regular basis to deliver packages. Either I get neighbors or don't get mine. Incompetent morons..
"I gave it a one due to nothing lower, I was to have a package delivered today, I paid for delivery. I kept checking delivery, my husband was outside working. UPS took it to an Auto parts store on the other side of town and I now have to drive to pick it up. I should get the delivery fee refunded. They are to deliver to the home NOT SOME PLACE ELSE- AND NOT SOME PLACE ACROSS TOWN!!"
If i could give ups 0 stars that’s what they would get from me. UPS is horrible the workers that works in houston texas not good!!!! They are bad business they don’t deliver when they say they would . They don’t even knock at the door at all i stayed home all day waiting for my package for my niece Birthday paid 2 days air delivery so i can have it on time ! These worthless jokers said they made a attempt to deliver both day i stayed home waiting i even called 6am in the morning telling them how important this package is . it’s so important i have to sign for it that’s why i stay waiting where i live there’s one way in and one way out not once did an ups truck came threw i even called to verify my address make sure it was correct they told me everything was good so i told them how they saying they made an attempt to deliver when no one came to the door i ever went out side waiting . they told me they will call me in a hour so they can’t make attempt to deliver again that’s was almost four hours ago heard nothing back . When you Finally get an human on the phone they are worthless as well they can’t do little to nothing i ask can i have or get transferred to the person who i am waiting to give me a callback ! I was told they don’t have the ability to do that so i’m confused on why they even customers services when no one getting any help these people getting paid to do nothing i will never deal with ups again every time i do it’s always an horrible experience . at least with Fedex they will leave a slip it wouldn’t be an Hassle or lies
"I had very expensive speakers coming from Washington State that were supposed to be delivered on 10/21 by 7:00 at night. Was notified by email at 5:30 stating that the delivery had been delayed and was not given any time in which to receive shipment. Tried contacting UPS to reschedule delivery for Monday because of work schedule. Spent over 3 hours trying to reschedule through app. Trying to get a customer service rep to no avail. Went to local UPS store and could not reschedule or get any living human being from UPS to give me any idea of when delivery was going to be rescheduled. On Saturday the 22nd received update while at work. That delivery was going to be made immediately. Had somebody come over and wait at my house for the last 4 hours. Again, no delivery again. Not able to get a hold of customer service or anybody to find out what the status was. For such a large company to have zero customer service in this day and age is totally unacceptable. As far as my drivers are concerned for UPS, they are wonderful salt of the Earth. As far as getting a living human being that works for customer service from UPS. Again, totally unacceptable. In other words, a day and a half of being idle for delivery which is money out of my pocket but is okay but for UPS it's no big deal. I hope in the future somebody can come along and start a new business to be in competition with UPS because that's exactly what they need to get back to where their roots were. If there was such a thing as negative five they would get it."
"There is no customer service. Logged into ""My Choices"" to delay receipt of a shipment. Pressed on the button to delay the shipment. The ""Virtual Assistant"" told me to contact the shipper. The shipper told me to contact UPS. There is no option to speak to a person on the UPS website. The phone number given just connects to the useless ""Virtual Assistant."
"They never knock on your door when they deliver. Their operators are all automated robots. They don’t advise help or suggest anything. Very narrow in their customer service abilities. All they do is repeat themselves no matter what question you have and rush you through so the can get to the next call. All quantity no quality customer service, Count on computer generated operations at best. Robotic. No humans running this place thinking or improvising on anything in any way."
"UPS should be UPOS! They are useless. I ordered Sasaparilla from Amazon. It got dropped and 4 of 24 bottles weren't just broken, they were atomized. I got powdered glass in my fingers removing the bubble wrap. Trying to make a claim is damn near impossible, by design I am sure. I ordered another case last two weeks ago. It takes about a week to ship. I got the email that said it was delivered. No package arrived and my neighbors, who are home all day, didn't even see a truck pull up. Again, trying to do anything about it is nearly impossible. I will NEVER use UPS for personal shipping and I don't know why businesses continue to use them."
"As has happened countless times over the past 30 years UPS has kept me waiting at my home almost all day long with the promise that the parcel I was expecting was supposed to be delivered to me by a certain time. Today it was supposed to arrive between 1:30PM and 3:30PM. As usual the ETA was bumped up to 7PM. I waited until 8:30PM. It never arrived and I received no notification any which way telling me what was going on. You know how frustrating this is? Of course you do. If I sued this company for 30 consistent years of emotional damages brought about by their endless incompetency I would become a multimillionaire.

How to improve UPS? Get rid of your present CEO. Have professionally trained business personnel run this company. Hire people who are not inept and morally bankrupt. Provide your drivers as Amazon Prime does with the means to COMMUNICATE with their customers, supervisors, and staff so that your parcels are delivered on time to the place where they were intended to be delivered. A cell phone and GPS system would do nicely to let customers know when their parcels aee going to arrive. Develop an ethic that puts your customers and quality of service first. Get rid of ALL of your employees who drag your business down to anything less than what should be a professionally run parcel delivery service."
Worst service I have ever experienced. Completely unable to speak with an actual representative. Jumped through all hoops to get to the point of speaking with someone and there system disconnects. Meanwhile expensive item is floating out there somewhere with no way to get information. How is this company in business?
"So Bad.
Overnight package was to take 5 days.
I am on a job site with entire crew waiting for this package.

Called customer service several times. Every time takes about an hour of trying to reach a person. The people we reached lied to us just to get us off their back.
Spoke with a supervisor (Dave), and he told us that only the Center can help at 817 490 7304 and sent us there. We called and spoke with Ginger.
When I told Ginger at the center in Forthworth that the it costs us over $5,000/day of waiting for the UPS package, she told me ""I don't care"" . She said that I should call customer service again.

This will cost my company almost 30,000 in waiting

And this is only one package.

Want to take them to court to recover the losses they caused ."
"Do not buy from website uses UPS!! They supposed to delivery my package on the 13th Oct Thursday. Missed the delivery due to gate code was not provided. Called the driver and was told he will deliver again Friday the same time (gave him the code for gate and told him to leave at a save location) . Nothing was delivered on the Fridayand it was rescheduled to be delivered on Monday. No calls on Monday from the driver and did not received the package. After checking the tracking number, it shows the driver have 'attemped' the delivery.
Call UPS and was told best to leave it in the customers centre in Swords, so I agreed. Went to swords and was told the package is in Finglas.

Absolutely a joke. The staffs are nice to you on the phone. But they could not do the job right. Paid 15 euro for this delivery and yet I have to go to 2 places to collect it.

Never use UPS again."
"UPS used to be a highly respected company but now it is probably the worst delivery service available in the UK. Unfortunately they deliver for YOOX and because of this I will refrain from using that specific shopping site, I currently have items lost and have just received something that had to be arranged for redelivered three before it was sent and that was because it was sent to an access point 30 minutes away by car!!! The shop at the end of my road is an access point!!!
I'm also currently nervous to return some clothes that didn't fit. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE JOKE"
"Wow second time this week the terrible driver in my area can’t read address’s on a house. First they delivery to my neighbor and the neighbor cames over later that day tossing it on my porch, yesterday another neighbor down the street calls me and tells me the package has my address but was delivered to them. I notify UPS the first time They tell me I would get a call never did. Second time I told them there is something wrong with their driver not understanding how to read an address. Which is clearly on my house! They sent me an email telling me that I need to put correct address on file. Wth I took a pic of the label on both packages and clear as can be my address was correct. Who are they to tell me I don’t know my address. This driver who is doing a crap job needs to be spoken to. I have camera footage for the entire day. They can not tell me that there was a UPS truck at my house. It shows me walking over to another house to collect my large box carrying it to my house. And it shows another neighbor tossing the other one on my porch. So UPS before you call someone a liar. Check your facts first. Very disappointing. Curious which neighbor will get the next one I’m expecting. To bad Fed ex don’t deliver for the place I order from."
"I dashed into the ups store on Bijou in Colo springs to get help with a return. Talia was awesome , took care of it and I was back in my car in 10 mins!! Wtg Talia"
"store 2021 in Northville, standing in line to send out 2 packages (heavy!). After 10+ minutes finally got to the counter and the UPS lady said ""you need to go to that line (behind a gentleman who was having troubles sending out a package) because I'm doing drop offs now"". Really???And that kick is that drop-off lady took a lot more time than I did - she was looking up addresses, printing labels. Even after having to wait longer, I still got out of the store before drop-off lady. Very unprofessional. This store is unfriendly, not helpful, unprofessional."
"I put building buzz number, they still left the sticker rather bringing parcel to my apartment."
"They always double charge on brokerage fees, they’re never fast and their customer support is horrible. When ordering from the states -> Canada their brokerage fee is more than original shipping price and is almost always 4x what the duty charges are."
"UPS Expedited = Regular Air Mail

These guys simply let my package rot in custom detention even if I provided consent to use their own Custom Brokerage service for on-arrival clearance. Apparently they do not monitor customer facing mail boxes even! FedEx will outperform UPS hands down. Don't waste your time and money on this Regular Air Mail rebranded as UPS Expedited."
"That's what I would have given them if this site would allow it.
The drivers are liars. At least enough are for it to matter. I can't even count how many time they've left a ""sorry we missed you tag"" at the front door of our condo building! Every time I was there. All they had to do was use the intercom...All they had to do was try... just like Amazon, FedEx, DHL, USPS (when the need a signature.) They all make successful deliveries most of the time. The intercom for the building goes straight to my cel-phone. There is NO EXCUSE. Hell even middle-school kids selling candy know how to use the intercom.

I've been putting up with this for as long as I can remember. Does anyone know if we can start a Class-Action suit against them? They take are money with a promise of service and basically they are stealing it."
"Any time I’ve ordered something and they use ups I already know it’s going to be an issue. I literally just had a delivery driver come to my house without knocking leave a note and go. I mean seriously it’s not hard I even had my window open and was sitting near the front door and nothing. Other times, the drivers don’t pay attention to the addresses and have dropped off a $1200 iPhone to out neighbors house which is also an Air BnB so luckily Apple sent a delivery notification and we were able to go get it off the porch before someone stole it. Just terrible service and careless delivery drivers. Definitely always use usps if possible they at least get the right houses and mailboxes. I bet they’d knock too."
"I used THE UPS STORE at 14545 S. Military Trail Ste J
Delray Beach, FL 33484, to return ATT equipment consistent with ATT/UPS procedures. The quality of services provided was genuinely pleasant and helpful with the process. I HIGHLY recommend this store whenever the need arises for anyone who seeks competency, kindness and assistance.

Thank you SO MUCH!!!!"
"UPS ""damaged"" one of my packages in transit after I paid duty fees for it. Then they apparently ""fixed"" the issue and sent my package to me only for me to find it full of random junk that the vendor I purchased from doesn't even sell. Obviously my package was tampered with and possibly stolen and replaced with garbage. They also lost a package that was shipped from the same city... The service is deplorable"
"I would like to just rate cause this is the worst service ver they left the packages on the street and even don’t care to put in a safety place
Service is sucks"
had a 8k gaming pc and was sent out 2 weeks ago and come out to find it was destroyed it was like a Cooken and now i want a refund or 8k back but now there to scared to answer my emails
"Worst ever!!! 2 years ago, I shipped 6 packages (catalogues for a customer) from canada to US, 5 arrived, the 6th one was lost and they were all sent as 1 shipment. customer refused to pay of course and it took 6 weeks and tons of calls to ups to get reembursed. this week, I am waiting for heater parts which are desperately needed and I ordered from US instead of local dealer as I needed them FAST. they were supposed to delivered about a week ago. the package is about 15 minutes from me at ups station. there was an issue with the address label (house number missing) so I called a week ago to make sure they correct it in their system and they read it back to me correctly. it wasn't changed. package was supposed to be delivered 4 days ago as per tracker, then the next day, then the next day, then msg that address was incomplete so I arranged for pick-up point and was PROMISED it would be there yesterday which it says on their automated system as well, but wasn't. called again a moment ago and 'maybe end of day today' - unexceptable, no idea how ups stays in business. never had issues like this with any other currier. what a joke, minus not funny."
I wait of a package for 10 days from Netherlands to Greece and I have to wait from 8 in the morning till 18.30 to get my package and the rude ups employe on the phone told me that they can't tel me some exact time and I have to wait or the package will go back
"I tried to pay the customs duty fee for the shipment I received through an online UPS website, but I was getting a validation error in the payment form. then I called UPS customer service to pay the duty fee, they are asking me to share my card details to make the payment, but it's really doubtful to share the card details. Also, it's really hard to explain and make them understand the customer service people."
Professional delivery that was on time. Perfectly wrapped and the rug was beautifully protected. UPS were superb.
"The UPS driver left a note without knocking on my door or ringing my doorbell two days in a row. I called UPS three times went to access location, and then went to pick up from their warehouse until they said my $2k package was not there. Customer service sucks no one knows what they are doing. AMAZON SHOULD NOT WORK WITH THIS COMPANY."
I had my wife send my ID so I can fly to Toronto and UPS said it would be delivered on a Monday. I had to forfeit a plane ticket after the package was not delivered at which point they promised me an early Wednesday delivery. By end of day Wednesday the package had not been delivered and I lost my Wednesday evening plane ticket.
"As a natural consumer of products generally especially this day & age we as people have to get things shipped to us for a multitude of reasons. Not only that but we are subject to only a couple of delivery services/companies nationwide that ship nationwide and other then that we rely on our local delivery places. With that being said it really does make the customer experience horrendous when 80% of the time you order a package you can expect some type of issue which may have not been a result from yourself, but an issue none the less with places like UPS and or even FedEx. Recently with the last 2 packages I have had issue with delivery with UPS. I don't know if it is a competence thing after a pandemic and having to deal with high turn over and people not doing there job correctly. Either way I am now in a place where this error by UPS in not delivering my package today is now detrimental to my job seeing as I needed said package to work my job, went about what I was suppose to do to receive the package on time, and low and behold who screws the pooch once again. UPS."
"Worst company ever
If you want that your order be delivered DO NOT use this crap
All things suppose delivery to me by UPS have been lost
TODAY I have to a business warehouse To pick up my package left there!! horrible service horrible customer service !!!
The government has to do something and close this scam company"
"Absolutely unacceptable service! No attempt to deliver while claiming that you did. Spent all day at home knowing how terrible UPS is, and well, UPS exceeded my expectations. Take feedback seriously, the customer service brushed off my complaint. Absolutely awful!"
"Terrible. Has to the worst ran delivery service still operating. They have fumbled around a very expensive package of mine for 3 days now. If you can help it, never have a package ordered through here. This company needs to be out of business as soon as possible."
"I waited all day for the delivery and it never arrived, then they tried to deliver next day when I wasn't home and they left it at an access point 40 minute walk away (when I have at least 3 others that are within walking distance).

I called their customer support THREE (3) times over the last 3 weeks to try to get them to deliver my package to a closer access point and they always say (yes sure I will put a note, it will be done in 2 days) and it still has not been redelivered.

They are legitimately keeping my package hostage I don't understand."
"I will not use ups if there is any other option. Once I ordered lawn mower blades, all I got from ups was an empty box with a hole in the end, I filed a complaint but never heard back from anyone.
I ordered a replacement panel for my expensive grow light once, and when ups delivered it, it was mangled so badly it couldn't be used, contacted ups, and they laid the responsibility on to the light company, ups is careless, and irresponsible, and I don't see how they stay in business,"
"Avoid them at all cost. I've never had any problems with any shipping companies, but every time i have to deal with UPS, it is an absolute nightmare."
two weeks for air freight delivery! with no communication about delays! bad service
They delivered my package to a different location than what i had requested and they told me that they delivered it to that one. I went to the store and they told me it wasn’t there. I called UPS customer service and they told me to call 118877. I tried and it told me that the number could not be reached. I called UPS customer service back and told them that the phone number didn’t work and they hung up on me. I called back and they hung up on me again.
"The seller sent the packaged goods to UPS on October 5, today the status is ""sticking labels"". THEY LABEL FOR TWO WEEKS!!! And it's not the first time"
"UPS claimed they had tried to deliver and the customer was not available for delivery, i was at home at the time i got the message, called customer service to ask what the deal was, they told me i had to go pick up the packet 20 kilometers from where i lived my self because i was ""NOT HOME"" when they tried to deliver, which I WAS !! No one tried to deliver anything, since i was at home all day long. I simply refuse to pay again for me to go pickup a package that was ment to be delivered to my home!"
"Good products and prices but the sizing charts are not good enough. The Zhik jacket was too large. Luckily it fitted someone else. The Musto wetsuit trousers, too small but I am able to modify them.
You should have free returns to streamline and give customers more confidence in buying without seeing, holding or trying on such a diverse range of technical products."
Bunch of holes gathered as shareholders whipping morons to deliver and they all fail their job....
"If you ever want to deal with the most convoluted system that makes no sense, deal with UPS and still never get your package.

I had a package coming from a retailer and only after a few days did they tell me they were using UPS and that was after they already shipped the product. The problem is my address is a PO Box and UPS won't deliver to a PO Box. Realizing that, I immediately reached out to UPS to get the address changed to the closest UPS Distribution center. They said the only way to change address is set up account. Already had an account and you can't set up change of delivery address because you need an InfoNotice Number, which YOU NEVER GET, so you can't complete the change of address online. So, I called into the customer service department, got the automated system and chose the closest UPS Distribution Center so I could go to pick up my package. THEY CHARGE YOU $7.99 to drive to their location so they don't have to do their job and deliver it, but I thought, sure, I'll pay it. I called into the UPS Customer Service Department and a live agent confirmed the location, the one I chose that was closest to me, and she said that my package is ready for pick up. I went to the location during the open hours given to me by the system and the UPS agent and they closed early. I drove from another city! So I returned today and the UPS guy said that my package was at a different UPS Distribution Center 45 miles away. Why? I immediately called UPS Customer Service and asked them why did they have my package at the location I did not choose and not the one the UPS Agent said that where I could pick up my package. The only answer I kept getting is it's based on original address. He kept saying I have to go online and make a change of address request online in my account. I told him that wasn't possible (Remember, you need an InfoNotice Number that you never get.) and I had already made the request to have my package delivered to the closest UPS Distribution. I asked him to just deliver the package to the UPS Distribution I chose. He said he couldn't do that. So I said, ""You're just going to return my package to the sender because your company is **********"" (I can't post on this website.) I repeatedly asked him why send my package to a center 45 miles away. I asked him if he's going to reimburse me for my gas already spent going to the location I CHOSE and the one that the UPS AGENT said it was. Needless to say, I still don't have my package. I am not driving 45 miles. They already charged me $7.99. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST. HORRIBLE AUTOMATED SYSTEM. HORRIBLE COMPANY. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. No point in the doing a survey. They don't care."
"Palmyra mo

Drove 30 miles
Waited a half hour only to find out customer counter permanently closed
Northing on website!!!"
"Today I have received a notice that my package had been delivered so I looked out on our front steps and it wasn’t there. Long story short, I found it a quarter-mile down our driveway by a sign that had an arrow pointing towards our house with our address on it. Lazy people!"
UPS driver lied about delivering a package from a clothing company. I ordered several hundred dollars worth of fall clothing. I ordered the items on 9/4 and it was delivered to wrong address on 9/15/22. I found out that it was delivered to another address in another county. It took me a month trying to get UPS on the phone and they NEVER resolved the issue. These drivers are stealing items!!!! UPS is just as bad as FedEx.
"UPS delivers delivery notes and leave, not parcels. Very lazy people. They always make up some lame excuses. I asked UPS and they said they are aware of the problem but cannot do anything since the drivers are independent contractors."
"First it says it’s going to be delivered to my house, an hour after the time it has to be delivered it still isn’t there. Then i get a mail saying it’s delivered by some pick-up point, it isn’t there. Then I get another mail saying it was delayed but that it had arrived, so I go to the pick up point and guess what? It still isn’t there."
A number of times now they delivered my packages to other houses. And so many times they delivered other packages to my house. I think I’m close to a 700.00 loss now not to mention my childrens medical kits where amongst these packages so it moved their surgeries out that they needed. I have even went to the extent of painting a big ass rock with my house number on it outside ughhh so frustrating.
"If possible I would give no review, I received 4 emails, 4 days stating your order on route, rescheduled every day, then after chasing them numerous times told me my package was lost, customer service of this coy us crap, avoid if possible."
"After 2 attempts that were provided while you are at work, and they are not willing to have anyone else sign for packaging, took forever to even get an operator, got an operator and finally scheduled a delivery (my son's birthday gift!) they never even showed up, no updates on the site, no call, just no show, no information of any kind. Thier website is a disaster and so is their poor service. Still no information on a delivery of a birthday gift, which we never received. Very disappointed 😞"
"Absolutely horrid experience with UPS, don’t know where to start… Holding a package in a facility for multiple days with no updates. Shipping a package from a regional facility to a different regional facility and then back to the original one… and when asked if i could just come pick up the package, was told that it would take an entire business day to process? How could it possibly take a day to process a package that’s already in your facility."
the worst expereince ever. the customer service is terrible. NOT reccomended
"Would not respond via email and I had no idea how to get a hold of them.
When I took about an hour and finally was able to leave them a message to change delivery address UPS sent me a email confirming the change and yet the la mage was delivered for the original address.
Now even though UPS walked the package to the door 3 separate times it is still not here.
Seems asinine.
Again nowhere did it say nor have I ever had to sign for a package.
Kind of hard to sign for a package when you want me to be sitting around for up to 3 hours waiting for you when I too am At work.
Now I have to spend more time out of work to get my package. Again you walked it to its destination and didn’t drop it 3 separate times. Super frustrating especially after ever being informed of such delivery methods."
"I am so over UPS and their excuses. I delayed a shipment and they charged me $9.99. Then they no showed and the driver lied about attempting the delivery. I waited for 4 hours. When I called, I was told they would “escalate “ and have a supervisor call me within an hour. No call. I will not use them again."
Horrible!!! Package not delivered when notified. Called customer service. Was completely unable to understand the broken English of the rep as they were also unable to understand English and asked me to repeat myself several times. Kept telling me to check the website for updates even after I told him that the website was not giving me the update and stated it was being delivered today. So frustrating.
I purchase an item from America and they offered several different delivery options at different prices and I paid for the 7-14 business day delivery option. The goods left very quickly from the supplier and made it to the UPS depot in California - for delivery to Australia. The goods then went to Austria and spent over 9 days in the Austrian facility and then nothing. During this time I contacted UPS (given cut n paste replies from a script) and told only deal with the sender - sender got a slight amount of details. Then eventually find out it went to Austria Post (remember I'm in Australia) and find out that it is with destination postal service but nothing else. Also receive email from supplier stating goods haven't been delivered and UPS cannot provide any further details. I cannot believe UPS cannot or will not take responsibility for tracking (heaven forbid delivering what they charged for).
I wish they had an option for zero Stars. UPS has lost a huge important package for me. Then they tried to tell me they attempted to deliver when I have cameras proving that they were lying because they gave an exact time they were here and I have and saved footage of the hour before of and after the time frame they said they were here. They are horrible always have been and always will be. I hope that Amazon shuts them down and we won't have to deal with ups and their horrible service any longer.
"Trying to return a package and the sender chose UPS to pick it up. BE AWARE that UPS has a policy that if drivers have labels with them, they do not actually have to pick up the packages. They were supposed to pick up my package Oct 14. Going on 4 days now, I can't get an answer as to whether or not the package will ever be picked up. The original sender has paid TWICE for them to pick it up now. UPS is still giving me the runaround telling me to drop off the package, which I can't do because of limitations, or I can pay to schedule another pickup, AFTER THE SENDER HAS PAID THEM TO PICK IT UP TWICE ALREADY. 3 Agents, 2 supervisors, 2 dispatch people. 3 lies and 6 excuses. What a crappy company. They have really gone downhill."
"Absolutely awful, been out for delivery for 9 hours, I'm realistically 10 minutes down the street from the facility it left from. Much rather use fed ex or usps. Ups is garbage, coming from 21030.

Edit- 10 hours after it was sent out for delivery it finally arrived, 10 minutes down the street. Thanks yellow belt in sparks, Md."
Can’t speak with customer service just a computer I will never do business with them again.
UPS deserves less than zero stars. Absolutely terrible customer service. Very hard to speak to a person. The bot in transferring three calls hung up three times. What is the problem???
"UPS has now been awarded my #1 spot in the worst customer service list. I would rate zero stars if possible.

Full disclosure: I put the wrong address on a package, so I caused this whole issue.

However, trying to get this problem resolved has (so far) taken 5 or 6 phone calls and at least 2 hours on the phone with customer service (disservice). As of this moment, the issue is still not resolved.

Customer service which is in Singapore is very patient but completely unable to take any action to resolve the problem. All I get are excuses and no viable solutions.

There is not enough time, nor space to fully detail this complaint. However, this has been such a frustrating, time consuming, and eye opening experience that I will no longer utilize UPS services where I am the payor. I suggest you reconsider using them as your shipping partner."
"Unfriendly front clerk.. No personality, used her hands to motion next up in line... The other clerk pretending to be busy while people were out the door. I hope i don't have to return to the Massillon location"
"If you made it here please do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost. I read the previous reviews and I thought people were just unlucky but it was beyond my imagination I was going to have such a terrible service:

- Missing information in their website: you get an estimation in their website then they say that in the case of individuals you need to drop the shipment in their main warehouse in Mascot, they can't pick it up from your personal address
- Poor customer service: you get to their office in Mascot and they communicate it's in a different location. Once you get there, they say you have to be back to their office in Mascot
- Misleading quote: this was the main reason why I picked UPS, the quote I got online was cheaper than the rest of competitors. What a mistake. After dropping my stuff in the warehouse (19 boxes, 350kg) they said they would give me a call to confirm the price. This was my last week before relocating overseas. Finally the day before jumping on that plane I got that call saying the amount was ~$5,800 (in their website I got it for ~$3,400)
- Damaging the delivery: well, maybe they have a terrible website and customer service but when it comes to their business, shipping, they should know their stuff, right? Wrong. They water-damaged 6 out of 19 boxes, my personal belongings came in different boxes to the heavy-duty ones I supplied. Content was very damaged (I had to throw away around 20-30 books because they were all wet, had to run 5 or 6 laundries for the same reason, all my clothes in the boxes were wet). They also lost some small stuff, they didn't even care to nicely put it back all of it in a new box. The boxes they used were way subpar for an international delivery, they also arrived broken. Terrible.
- Extra charge: the icing on the cake. A few weeks after this nightmare service I got an SMS from a debt recovery company, Solved Collections Group, saying that I owe $440. By the looks of it they gave a wrong quote on the phone and now they're saying I have to pay that extra. Asking for the tax invoice there's no reference to that extra amount, it's just a new random figure they came up with. It could've been 66-million instead of 66-hundred. Needless to say I'm disputing that as they have to prove they provided with that quote beforehand or I agreed to be liable for any mishandling on their accounting.


All in all, please avoid."
"UPS IS THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE. THIRD WORLD CONTRY DELIVERS BETTER THEN THEY DO , AND IF YOU HAVE TO SEND IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE ; DEAD LINE PAPERS , BILLS , MEDICATIONS , ETC. , DO NOT TRUST THEM, I SPOKE WITH ABOUT 10 SUPERVISORS AND THEY ALL GAVE ME DIFERENT ANSWERS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND NOTHING WORKED. DO NOT USE ups ."
"UPS doesn't even have CUSTOMER SERVICE. Their chat is worthless and faulty, never giving you a link to accept a live agent, after telling you to click the link for an agent. NO call request ever goes through after submitting it and NOT ONE AGENT KNOWS A THING!"
Should have looked at this site before wasting money and time for nothing on various UPS shipments from Germany to Spain. Total chaos. Unhelpful service agents. Never again and if you are doing your research before doing business: don't do it!
"When you pay for a home delivery you shouldn't have to get a bus and travel 30 mintues to pick it up! There is a UPS drop off point literally at the end of my road but no, it was left at the one miles away.
The Saltdean drop-off is so useless that they won't even accept return parcels so now I have to travel 30 minutes again to the other depot. Livid."
It was supposed to come on friday and it was at the wear house right next to my house. It ended up not coming till the next tuesday and it took them 5 days just to drive 3 miles. Horrible service and can't hold up their bargain.
"unbelievably incompetent and unreliable. I will NEVER use UPS ever again. its a very greedy company that charges ridiculous high prices for shipping a small package, commits to deliver on a certain date, and then completely fails without any shame or sense of rsponsibility. Try calling customer service, they have call centers in countries where they pay miserable wages, because they are so greedy, so we really cant expect much help from these employees. I paid $300 to send a package from the US to Italy, which was extremely urgent. I dropped off on 10/8, was promised a delivery on 10/14. It didnt even leave the US until the 14th, when it should have been delivered already in Italy. Today it's th 16 and the package has not left Germany since the 14th. Now they say it will be delivered on the 18th. But when I called, the guy said to not expect on the 18th. Most likely 19 or 20!!! Outrageous. If I had used USPS priority, it takes 7 days and I would have paid about $45 instead of $300!
It's disgusting and this should be illegal. If they charge $300 for a commitment that thy deliver in 5 days, they should be obligated to comply or our money back! Greedy incompetent UPS> Do not use!"
"One star is a over rate. UPS used to be great, but now I dread to see my packages will be handled by Ups . Boxes end up at neighbors house, damaged or literally thrown in the BUSHES! That's when they show."
"I've had UPS drivers twice this week, neither of them rang the doorbell (Ring doorbell so I would know). As I was close to the door first time, I heard a knock. Second time didn't hear anything, so had to collect a heavy parcel from a shop, which is not a point for a home delivery."
For some reason UPS can never delivers anything on time. What is the point of an estimated delivery date when it is always wrong. I have had so many packages delivered late. Maybe companies should do business elsewhere to companies who can deliver on time.
"I ordered some shoes for a gift for my boyfriend a week ago. I received a notification stating that it was out for delivery… Literally 5 MINUTES LATER!… I receive a notification that my address is incorrect 🤔🤔. NOT POSSIBLE! I called customer service 3 TIMES, and no one could help me!! I continuously was given the run around.. They would take down my info. but I didn’t receive a call or an email. Smh… Birthday surprised ruined!!"
On October 13th I placed an order with a company and paid for 1 day air delivery. ($30). The company sent out the package from Thursday and due to mechanical reasons on UPS part my package was delayed. I contacted UPS that claimed that they will have my package delivered the next day. They finally updated the info at 6:43 am on 10/15/2022 stating that they will have the package delivered today. However the driver lied stating he could not deliver my package because no one was here. Really? Been waiting at my door for the past 3 hours and no UPS truck or driver came so I guess I was invisible. I decided to call UPS which I spoke to 3 different representatives who told me that they will escalate my call and have someone from the Deerfield Beach office give me a call which I never received. I finally called back and spoke with another representative who informed me that there was no way I would have gotten back a call from the Deerfield Beach office because that office is closed on the weekend. I then asked for a manager who when she came on the phone was very rude and would not admit that the policy clearly states if a driver attempts the package and no one was not home (WHICH I WAS) they should leave an info notice. No info notice was there because clearly the driver did not come. I just need for UPS to give the customer service that is of quality and not mediocre. I’m tired of their lack of urgency and incompetence.
I hate ups … Poor customer services and poor service
"Three packages in a row have been opened! ENOUGH!
One package of very expensive makeup didn’t even make it.. shipped to me from a gf. They said it was damaged and they threw it away!! Liars!!"
"ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT UPS IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN OR FIND DRIVERS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. I ORDERED MY MEDICAL EQUIPMENT $6,000.00 OF DURABLE MEDICAL. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THE DRIVER WAS SO LAZY HE LEFT IT OUTSIDE MY HOME ON THE SIDE WALK. YES, YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY. I HAVE TRIED CALLING WELL THAT'S A BIGGER JOKE. ALL I CAN SAY IS UPS YOU PEOPLE STINK, STINK, STINK. HOPE YOU GET SHUT DOWN SOME DAY. YOUR ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING PEOPLE."
"p*** poor service, absolutely a nightmare to deal with. Guaranteed I will be doing business somewhere else never again!
Overcharged
Always late
Never can guaranteed anything
even had packages damaged because the drivers don’t give two sh***!!"
Ups charge for next day service but don’t deliver then use bad weather as an excuse when there no bad weather at all I know times is hard for good workers but they should not offer this service if they can not commit
"UPS is a lost cause. When someone delivers to me anything from Amazon, I contact them to tell them that next time they should use the USPS. UPS delivers late, gets stuck in transit, may have your package stay in one place for 24 hours or more without any action, and when I call them, there is always a person there who cannot help with anything. With my last delivery, they dared to tell me that ""they don't deliver to my area on Saturdays"". Also, their online statement on the date of delivery has changed every day. At least with USPS the date of delivery that they give you when you ship your item is the accurate one! UPS is the proof of how we all become a 3rd world country unless we stop this process right away!"
"Delivery BOY decided to enter through my side yard and give my very frail pets- (who were deathly ill at the time we bought them but treated by our vet) toxic treats and then called animal cruelty stating that my animals were being abused/neglected. Animal cruelty came and said he had no basis for the claim he made because my animals were not as he described (they are skinny but not starved- as pets that were emaciated and full of worms can get) and are under a vets supervision and have been since the time of purchase. He should should stick to his job and keep his nose out of the customers lives. Maybe then he/UPS will have the ability to do a better job- driving and handing someone a package in tact and on time. I will be looking into what can be done legally, especially in the event that his toxic treats make my pets even sicker. *for some reason the ""date of experience"" date isn't stating the correct date- which is 10/14/22. It keeps changing it to 10/13 and 10/12."
"Spectacular service, I ordered a vital package from Germany. The UPS deliveryman, not wanting my package to be stolen, threw the package down on the ground loud enough so that I could hear that the package had arrived. He did so with such force that I heard it through a closed door, up a flight of stairs and down a hall. Thanks UPS! Always looking out for me. :D"
"I went to the UPS store here in Statesboro, one of the young Caucasian girls was giving me a very hard time, she proceeded to tell me my small package was gonna be over $60 to send it off and she had not weighed it or anything. I sent a package the same size a month ago and it was not near that much! She was picking in a sense and I making excuses to not help me with getting the package out. I could have really showed my butt, I wasn’t gonna allow this little girl to take me there. She was nasty and rude, I failed to get her name but I would like corporate to observe this review because now I’m looking at it sideways."
"First time I've had a bad experience. Paid for overnight shipping and instead my order was defaulted to 2 day shipping. This is a problem as it extends over a weekend and will be delivered via signature required when I am out of town. Unfortunately the representative who sounded like he didn't want to deal with my problem offered to hold it at an access point for 5 days but unfortunately it closes at 7pm, which is still during my working shift hours. This all could have been avoided if they just properly shipped my item with the correct shipping method. I'd rather have my items shipped with amazon prime and we already know how horribly packaged those are. But hey at least they arrive on time."
"They just constantly drop the ball. I'm literally going to have to avoid any website that uses UPS. Lost packages, packages sent to Texas when I'm in Colorado or Kansas.. over priced for crap delivery service"
They usually seem good. But their app sucks. Been trying to log in. Shows my picture and everything. But somehow not logged in. Try talking to support and sends me back to my orders. Seems like the only screen working. Not sure what the problem is. But driving me nuts.
They should deliver new iphone from Shipito. It was marked as delivered at the gate but the box never come.
Company is full of snobby a** low life’s who care less about their jobs and their customers satisfaction. I’ve had to reorder some custom glass THREE TIMES because it continues to come broken. The company who makes the glass has wrapped it literally 20 times in bubble wrap and other materials and it still arrives broken. Bunch of pr**ks UPS are.
"Hello, I do not recommend this company to the bottom. I am a business customer and I have enough, as UPS treats customers, I sent parcels twice a week and waited 45 minutes at the door until someone would pick them up, after being picked up by a UPS employee, the parcel stood for another four hours on the ground next to the door, I returned there and pointed out to a UPS employee he answered me for he does not have time, so I ask for these people working there, apropos, I paid for the parcel the next day, which the client did not receive on termini, they are ordinary scammers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"IF I COULD GIVE UPS A NEGITIVE 5, I WOULD! I ordered baking ingredients for my catering business and UPS lost my $600 package. Because the sender didn't give me the option to fully insure my package. As a buyer I am the one who had to eat the $600 loss. I'm a disabled woman in a wheelchair living on disability. Trying to make it by doing some side work to pay for my medical treatments. UPS didn't care. They refused to pay to order the product they lost. We spent hours on the phone waiting on hold just to finally get someone on the phone who I could hardly understand. The incompetence shown in this situation was stressful and I was so upset they cost me thousands that I could have made to pay for my medical care. UPS showed zero empathy for the situation. I was so frustrated that i began having minor seizures, and my fiancé had to take over the calls. A billion dollar company stole $600 from someone who lives on a measly disability check. They are ruthless and heartless, and I would NEVER ship through them again! There is a hot place in hell for heartless people like that. Because of their incompetence I can't afford my infusions and I will suffer pain from my health condition (RSD) the pain from my disease is the most painful condition known to man. My life literally depends on my infusions. Because of UPS, I won't be able to continue my treatments. The shipper is not willing to send me my order since it was not them that lost the package. I'm literally writing this looking through tears and in panic attacks since I know the intense suffering that is coming. I hate UPS for their heartless way they have handled this situation. I will NEVER ship UPS again! If you have anything your life depends on, I highly recommend that you use someone else!"
"I have never been so frustrated with a delivery company. Simple bunch of packages from a Home Depot order and they can't even deliver them. I spent 1-1/2 hours with ""support"" last night and another hour today. Each time you have to go through a painstaking menu. Even the supervisors don't care and actually argue with you. Charged me extra to have delivered on a specific date and they couldn't do"
"I have attempted to Live Chat with UPS representatives 3 times prior to this review today. All 3 times, I ask if I am speaking to a United States UPS Customer Service Representative. All 3 times they leave you sitting there and refuse to answer your question. Eventually they cut you off. UPS, you need to remember, we are your customers who, by the way, are the reason you are STILL in business. Treat your customers with respect and courtesy. Your overseas associates do not do that. They treat us like garbage. But you already know that and you allow it. Shame on you. Poor business ethics."
Does it really make a difference saying what happened? Nothing will change .. not the first time being let down by them and unfortunately it’s not my choice that they deliver.
Terrible. Lack common sense.
"The UPS serving the Riverdale, GA area is the worst. I also don’t like that the delivery service never has a solution that doesn’t require an automated response. The drivers are not held accountable for not delivering packages. They will claim to redeliver and never do. I wish businesses that work with them start holding drivers accountable. It’s gotten out of hand."
"Pathetic Service, Unreliable Customer Service.
They lost my first package. If a package needs a signature, they will just skip the delivery and send you the email, that they missed you, without any information notice. Now they ask to pick up my delivery from their nearby access point.
I have never felt so frustrated in my life this much over a simple delivery."
"I’m wish I could give zero stars. They never actually come to deliver the package, come late at night. UPS is lazy and doesn’t need to be handling anyones package. I sat home for two days waiting for an important package and got a notification saying a delivery was attempted when I can see my door and it was not. Terrible service."
If could give a zero I would I ordered my husband's halloween costume on Oct 1st. Here we are Oct 13 shipped from company on Oct 7th out of Minnesota ups managed to make it to Illinois Monday but lost the package after that. Then had the nerve to tell me to do their job and call the company I ordered from and have them file a claim. So I said so you want me to do ups job so is ups going to pay me. He said no . I was totally seriously. Do not ship with ups. They stuck
"I ALWAYS have problems with UPS! They were supposed to deliver a pkg today, it didn't come, BIG surprise! In the past, they have lost pkg, told me I could pick up pkg at their distribution ctr, drove 20 minutes to get there, waited til 8 pm, then was told I couldnt get it. I HATE dealing with these people!! I'm going to contact the consumer protection agency and At&t. I HOPE they switch to use or fedex!!!"
"I have been sitting by the door all day long waiting for a delivery, which was promised to be delivered by 9 pm. I just tracked it again because it was out for delivery but hadn’t arrived, and it says that an attempt was made at 5:30, which is bull!"
"Honestly, I would give zero stars if I could. We have a front porch and back porch and two huskies who always hang out on our back porch and our UPS drivers ALWAYS put our packages on the ground on the back porch right in front of my dogs so every one of our packages get chewed to pieces. The way our driveway is, the front and back porch are as easily accessible as the other yet they always lay it on the ground where my dogs are. It’s ridiculous and we have multiple places that packages can be laid where the dogs can’t get them."
They do not want to help or answer the phone. Took me 5 tires to get a hold of someone. She did not help and ended up hanging up the phone. I had a scheduled item pick up and driver missed the item. They said I had to drop off the DINNING TABLE myself and hung up.
"How is UPS still in business? It should be boycotted! The worst mailing service ever. They couldn't deliver my UPS package to my home so instead they said they would drop it off at a UPS location the next day. I went to the location, no package. I've spend hours of my time calling UPS to see when it will deliver. Everyday they tell me the next day. Then they don't deliver it. I'm so tired. Worst company ever."
"There is no ZERO star. That is why I gave you 1 star, even if you did not deserve 1 star. Never in my history have I gotten my package on time. Always send an email saying the delivery day is pushed back.  I had a check to get by today that is for my mortgage payment, and I paid the overnight delivery fee. But as usual, I get an email saying the delivery day has been pushed back. Thanks to UPS, I am going to pay a penalty fee for my mortgage. The funny answer I got from customer service is "" after you received your package, call us and we will defend your overnight delivery fee i.e $25. Do you think I worry about $25 more than my mortgage late payment fee and my bad history?"
"Terrible service. Fine when everything goes well, but if you have any sort of a problem, forget about customer service, it's totally useless, all they do is look at the same tracking screen as you do, but do nothing to resolve any issues. 5 phone calls later, including one where i was disconnected while on hold after 10 minutes, and i still cant find out what the issue their tracking service says ""needs to be resolved""They also have it marked as attempted delivery, COD charges refused which is not true"
"It baffles me why businesses still use UPS - they're late most of the time and it's not possible to speak to a human being when your parcel goes missing - which has happened to me multiple times with them.
I hope the business collapses and the CEOs burn in a horrible fire, they deserve nothing less."
"They call UPS ""Brown"" for reason, we all know what is brown and smells bad and that is a good description of UPS. Avoid them like the plague. At every level UPS service is HORRIBLE! Pay extra if necessary, but avoid this terrible company."
"Terrible experience. They brought a damaged package where you can easily understand that something heavy was put on it. I called for 10 days, and they told me for 10 days: ""tomorrow someone will take the package for inspection in order to refund my money"" No one never came and never paid the compensation. I called every day twice and they kept saying:"" within two hours Lorain Manager will call you"". She never called. Visually it looks to me like someone who laughs in your face and doesn't care about damage made to you."
"Never saw such a sheer incompetence. I cant get my parcel for the last several days. the driver pops up whenever he feels like, drops notification into my mailbox that he came and there was no one at home (yes, because i work). They never bothered to call to request which time is suitable for me. just drop this parcel in my mailbox and stop wasting my time. They have all my contact details. When i try to change the delivery type on their website after a cumbersome registration, it ALWAYS returns me a blank page. when i try to call on the indicated numbers, the automated machine replies and they dont connect to any operators, all your questions are supposed to be replied by an automated machine. When i try to fill in the claim, the website returns""filling a claim for your parcel is not available at the moment"". never use the service if you have a chance to avoid. never"
"They lost a package, admitted it was lost. Agreed to pay the claim but never did. I asked if the package was ever found to return it to me because I shipped a replacement for customer. Package was found and shipped to customer and not back to me. I have 100% proof of everything in emails from them however they still won’t pay the claim. Shame on them, actually illegal. How can these spineless thugs get away with this????"
What a joke for service! Driver stated dropped off at Front Desk @ 9:45am on 10/11/22 and Credit signed for it! Lol credit is not a person and most banks have no front desk. So Driver kept overnight package to a bank no record of Driver on cameras as all banks have cameras!! File a claim they say absolutely zero accountable and nothing but excuses! Now I have to apply for a STOLEN TITLE! NOT LOST STOLEN! This a joke and have warned everyone on there no customer service and LACK OF CONCERN!! Never offered any refund on missing next day delivery or paying for stolen title! Filed a claim what a scam this business is weeks for an investigation really its called talking with employee in the real world guess not UPS world! They truly do not care about there customers..
"Genuinely trash. By far the worst delivery service available. They provide an option to provide written authorization to leave packages on doorstep but still don’t leave the package, even after multiple signatures of realize. When I went to go to pick it up from the local UPS location where I was informed it would be, they tell me UPS sent it back to the shipper. I’m sorry but do you hire actual humans or just bodies without brains. My goodness get it together!!!!"
"UPS sucks , how many of my packages can they lose,can't get in touch with them."
"Generally my experience with UPS is positive but like they say, it only takes 1 bad experience to ruin it. Well, that happened to me. Unfortunately, I missed a delivery on 10/11 that required a signature. The door tag said they would attempt delivery the next day but 10/12 delivery never happened. (Does UPS not attempt a 2nd delivery anymore?) Instead I find out, the attempted next day delivery was to one of their Access Points, and that delivery was unsuccessful as well! So now I get to wait until 10/13 and hope again that the delivery to this Access Point is successful. Like other reviewers have said, calling customer service is a waste of time. They have ZERO problem solving skills and all they can do is regurgitate what the tracking info says on their screen which is no different than the tracking info on their app or website that we all have access to. So the moral of the story...make darn sure you are home if you are expecting a package that requires a signature. Otherwise...god speed in getting your package in a timely manner."
"If I could put zero I would.
They were to pick up a package from my home today between 9-1 pm. Never showed, called to find out if it would be pick up the customer service told me they would put a urgent request for driver to come back before 5pm to pick up package but couldn't be sure it would be done. I took the day at home just for UPS to pick up package. Don't use UPS not reliable for pick up or deliveries. Save yourself a headache use someone else."
If I could give absolutely no star at all I would. This carrier has the worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with. I was supposed to get a package on the 10th of October which never came in. I called the same day after work to ask what the problem was and didn’t receive any type of information informing me of why my package isn’t here. All the dude said was it will be there tomorrow as an answer to each of my questions. Next day comes October 11th still no sign of my package. Called to ask why my package is saying it got rescheduled now to be further out on the 17th of October and had zero of my questions answered. Not to mention how terrible their english is. I could barely understand what the person was saying due to english not being their first language. Sounds rude but it’s the honest truth. Save your time!
Very bad service my package lost 3 weeks ago and I keep calling the UPS every time they say something but never works .
"Not impressed with this carrier. Tracked my package one day and it stated it was basically at a local branch less than 10 miles from my residence, due to be delivered the next day. Checked the status that day and now the package is 500+ miles away in another state? Not very efficient. Unbelievable."
"Worst service ever. This scammers' enterprise should be delegalised. Not only do they take MONTHS to deliver your parcel, in the end they might not do it at all! It really makes me hopeless to hear that ""my boxes could have been lost"". The customer service is useless, unable to tell me anything about my parcels! I wish it was possible to give zero stars, because it's precisely what they deserve. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
Fantastic service all round. Delivery free returns helpful customer service and beautiful carpets and prices !
Ordered 2 iPhones 14 which UPS never delivered. Customer service very unhelpful
"Wish I could do a no star! Zip zero NADDA! Something has seriously gotten wrong with UPS!
These past couple of months my package is been taken to another location and then the representative that I finally got in touch with said that I set up an account to have this option for my packages to be delivered to a completely different address at what they’re calling a points pick up….
No… no.. I did not create an account to have my packages delivered to a “point” pick up place.
Words cannot express how angry I am. It took me months with all these issues of not receiving my packages and having things have to be sent back and be refunded because my package never showed up when they never even try to deliver my package to my home.
So now the UPS drivers have become so lazy they don’t want to deliver the package to your home to your front porch they take it to another place were you have to pick it up and say that that’s what you wanted to do when you never even knew!

From here on out I will have Amazon either deliver my packages or I won’t get them at all I don’t want anything to do with UPS you suck your workers suck!
Very poor job at the delivering peoples packages!
I was told I wasn’t the first customer this angry with this problem. Very poor job UPS get some new drivers or this place is going to go south really fast! I see the BBB getting involved! Because I’m not stopping here!"
"Horrible service, eveytime I have a package delivered by them they claim I was not home or my last name is not on our building directory when in fact I've been home everytime and am 1 of 12 names that is on my building directory. They either can't read or don't even get out of the truck, my package has now been delayed for 12 days because their request a drop off location went on vacation 3 days after I made the change and decided not to inform me of this. Just complete bs with this company i will do whatever I can to never use them again!"
"This Succasunna location never seems to NOT disappoint. First of all dread taking packages there because if you get the older man he's bound to say something nasty. But this time I had a younger person. He scanned the package in, and then walked to the back wall, and literally dropped it. No bending over, no care given. Hey that's ok, it's only pottery for a customer. What's jerks run this place. They still rate one star until someone at this location changes my mind."
My package said it was delivered and was not. They are supposed to take pictures so I know it was the correct house. I wanted to actually talk to someone to file a claim and you cannot talk to anyone at this company. You will get a computer telling you no! To apply online to file a claim u have to jump through many many hoops. Do not let ups deliver your items¡!!!!!!
"The worst courier service ever by far, customer service doesn’t exists , all they can do track a package, I called several numbers to file a complaint, asked for head office number, no one has it, basically complaint department doesn’t exist, very frustrating, my package was hold in the ups wear house, and can not do anything. Do not use their service, horrible service, useless customer service."
"With UPS over night MEANS over night!!! I’m so impressed with their delivery!! I got my desperately needed package by 11:00 am the next day. They are life savers!!! I’ve had things overnighted before with other companies, like USPS and FedEx and didn’t get it till the second day…. I can’t thank UPS enough!!!!"
"To tell you all that is wrong with UPS would take far to long. But they are consistently the worst of all delivery companies. Customer support, customer services, warehouse/handling, delivery, tracking.. All fail at they're jobs.
I highly recommend that.. They absolutely are the 1 company you should avoid using, do not send via UPS, when ordering online, check with the seller, if they use UPS as for the to send wirh a different company or buy the item from else where. If delivery is to be with UPS you can expect it to go wrong and highly unlikely to not receive it."
By far the worst shipping company out there will never use them again I hope they close their doors and give all the business to FedEx
"They are not honest and package didn't arrive on time at all and was important official documents that got damaged


Don't user this company for important documents"
"That is the standard text for this Parcel ""SERVICE"", ""The status of your parcel has changed.
Exception Reason: Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer coll.""

I'm puzzled WHY a company this BAD and USELESS is being hired altogether. Just why??"
"They not actually a delivery service, to be called that, you actually, have to deliver the parcels, UPS don't seem to understand that. UPS, actually stands for useless parcel service, it's really best to use a company that looks after its parcels and customers"
"Goods received on time but received by someone who is on holiday. Called customer services to complain and they simply don't understand. Driver was just plain lazy, customer services didn't think this blatant lie was a problem!"
"On Saturday, 10/01/2022, I arranged for delivery to Medfield, Ma. Store location sent from: 1000 N Green Valley Pkwy, Ste. 400, Henderson, Nv. 85074. I chose a delivery date from 10/7/10 to 10/10/22. Today it is now 10/10/22 & no delivery. The store was busy, the person entering the delivery info had to be instructed by another employee on how to enter delivery info and someone was nosily vacuuming the store at the same time. The printed receipt I was given is so faint that it cannot be read. Never again will I use UPS; Federal Express or USPS only."
"I called twice today because my package was send since the 10.04.22 today is 10.10.22 i called customer service i wait to be connected after i go my time twice two different lady told me my package will be deliver today she sees it on route i said on app its not showing, one said she is tell me what she see it should be here the latest seven pm. i wait and wait nothing. you all need to stop lying to customers because when we call its your word we're depending on because your on the same system to know. STOP LYING TO CUSTOMER I NEED MY PACKAGE."
By far the worst courier company available. I wish I could rate this company zero Stars. They don't deliver on time nor do they accept responsibility packages for being delivered weeks late if at all
I made an order on Thursday October 6th I paid for 2nd day delivery this is my diabetic pump supplies so it’s very important medical reasons. I’ve gotten 2 emails stating that package is out for delivery on Monday October 10th and I was suppose to get by no later than 7:45 pm now it’s almost 8 pm and it looks as though if you follow the driver he or she is at the distribution center!!!! No calls no emails nothing if I could a negative star I would this unacceptable especially when I paid an extra 40-50 bucks for this delivery also I’ve tried calling multiple times and you can’t talk to no one very very very upset I might have to go to the hospital for this but of course corporations could care less
"Ups is the WORST! They never even call you, they take all day giving real time updates!!! Very inconvenient as hell"
If I could do a zero I would. Waited in the house all day to sign for a package. Left a note on the front door could not delivere due to us not be here. My husband and I were both here. Back door wide open. We burned pine straw in the yard today all smoldering. But no one here. How stupid. We were and here. Called within 15 minutes of the note left and he was already out of the area supposedly. Never use UPS. Go with fed x or even the postal service. Now my husband and I have to stay home tomorrow because of him. It is our 48th wedding anniversary but he couldn’t be bothered to knock on the door..
If I could leave negative stars I would. UPS delivered a shattered fish tank this morning. Like what the hell?! This isn't the first incident I've had with UPS damaging or loosing a package.
UPS destroyed my parcel with no warning nor explanation. It contained lots of clothing and documents as I was moving countries. Absolutely do not recommend.
"Rude staff… kept getting transferred & hung up on! Problem not solved! They don’t care what your talking about! Takes forever to even talk to a “live” person & then you get tossed around like a hot potato! Everytime I use UPS, I have an issue! Makes me appreciate FedEx!"
"The delivery person did not call me, which is mandatory, before leaving the package at a store. So I had to find out for myself where it was."
Company and their website is a complete and total joke and has been for decades. You would think of company this big could simplify and get it right. A four-letter word describes them the best which I will not mention here because they may not put the review up. Use FedEx
"Can't give UPS a zero star, so one must do !!
UPS claim they delivered my international parcel at my backdoor at 13:33. They didn't. My video surveillance from the day shows NO activity on my entrance & driveway that day. NO parcel is to be found anyware.
Call customer service the next day, they tell me that they open a complaint file, and will e-mail me a form to fill for the lost parcel. E-mail with form never arrived - year no spam either - and call again the following day to ask it the e-mail is as slow as most physical deliveries .... just to lean, that my case is now just +48 hrs old, and their system don't allow them (UPS) to do anything further. Asked to talk to the manger. Ho would call back. After 4½ days I gave up waiting.
UPS sucks big time. Will never do business private nor company wise with UPS no more !!"
"I’m absolutely fuming, my parcel was meant to be delivered today at 12.45, I be waited in all morning and nothing, no parcel, I’ve checked the tracking number, only for them to tell me the address was wrong, but they gave the correct postcode surely they can go by post code? I gave the correct details, they said the sender printed the details wrong. I’ve been promised a call in a hour to see if my delivery can be re delivered, I smell a rat, and after reading these reviews there is definitely something dodgy about this company."
"On Friday UPS should of collected a parcel and the day before the man on the phone said I had to
Pay £4 cash to the driver as he wouldn’t be able to collect it ..I said reluctantly ok
But I want a receipt No delivery Friday but I took it to a UpS shop with no charges!!!"
"I had a package that was never delivered. I went through the claims process and had supporting photos and video that it was never delivered. Without hesitation they closed the claim ""Parcel found delivered"". They will not investigate this more. Why even have a claims department. Stick with USPS or FedEx if you need speed, but UPS has gone to poop. Othe records are inappropriate."
Easy to track. Delivered on time
STORE 6659 IN SARASOTA- I HAD THE PLEASURE WORKING WITH TAMMICA. SHE WAS KIND AND QUICKLY HELPED ME SEND OUT NUMEROUS PACKAGES. WONDERFUL SERVICE AND BEAUTIFUL ATTITUDE.
"UPS IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! I live in an apartment and I ordered an expensive item on 10/4/22. It was estimated to arrive on 10/7/22. On that day, the UPS driver couldn't even figure out how to enter the apartment EVEN THOUGH THE CODE WAS SPECIFICALLY GIVEN. The next day was just the same and there was only one delivery attempt left. I thought this would be just the same, but it was actually worse. THE PACKAGE WAS LOST AND THEY HADN'T INFORMED ME UNTIL 14 HOURS LATER!!! I FILED A CLAIM AND THE AVERAGE TIME TO BE APPROVED IS 10 WHOLE DAYS. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND UPS. It hadn't just happened to me since almost all the reviews online of Ups is lower than two stars. I hope this is informative to you."
"UPS Sucks. How is it that you will not let anyone speak to a human? Your website has glitches, I spent my entire Saturday morning trying to re-direct a package to a later date. After you robbed me of an extra $8, the package got delivered a day before expected. Worst customer service ever."
"Can’t even describe their service as disappointing. It down right sucks. It started with a merchant sending an expensive item to me which requires me to sign for it with picture ID. I get that! I missed the delivery on Friday. I called customer service for an alternative such as arranging for me to pick it up at a UPS store. They bounce me around to different Depts and finally told me no because the package was insured. Rather I sign at a UPS store or my house, I still have to sign and show picture ID. 😳 Anyway, I specifically ask the customer service agent who sounds like she works 2000 miles away with broken English if UPS will deliver on Saturday. She told me NO. On Saturday I stepped out to the store and back.I find out I missed another delivery. 😡 My dilemma now is that I will have to postpone my air travel on Monday or risk having my delivery sent back. This company really deteriorated."
If I could give a 0 I would. The worse company by far man. Been waiting for a package I was supposed to get on 10/7 the ups driver never left it took it back mind you never needed a signature so I don’t understand why he /she never left my package so now the freaking package is no where to be found unbelievable. That was part of my birthday outfit THANK YOU UPS you ruined that for me.
"Minus zero stars with this UPS company. Aka= you people suck. The delivery driver in my area is a liar and I will not take it lightly. I will single handedly start a petion to close this company down. I will take it state and federal wide. Ups has gotten away with to many bad things for one company. People pay money for their stuff being delivered to have the driver lie over and over again and get away with saying they lost the package when in reality it is in their possession. 2000 reviews and only 5 are in favor of UPS the rest are bad. This company should not be in business. Now, I am going on the better business bureau to write a review and a claim against you there."
"Absurd policies, broken software not fixed for extended period, poor customer service. Go anyplace else. Due to broken software they wanted me to sign a clearly incorrect address record by promising that ""the label will print correctly"" No thanks."
"If I have a choice to give negative rating. I would give -99. They picked up wrong item from my door steps, I called to intercept the package after 30 minutes they picked it, I called them continuously 4 days and each time I got different answer and eventually they delivered the wrong item to the address which is not meant to deliver."
"This is without a doubt the worst courier service I’ve ever come across.

Every delivery that I’ve had (or not) hasn’t arrived. They just leave it with a local shop. At first I thought it was because they couldn’t find my house but this has happened five times now. Also, the shop keeper tells me that they get around ten a day from UPS. This is clearly the driver not bothering to deliver. Much quicker than doing him job I guess."
"incompetent crooks says it all. Ordering items from the U.S. to be delivered to Canada, UPS is the only courier to charge me insane additional brokerage fees for what? For they courier to sign one piece of paper at the boarder. Get your nonsense out of here. Worst shipping company ever, in the history of the planet."
"May I say I hate UPS worst service ever. I've been waiting for my package for 5 days and they just keep sending me a message saying ""sorry we missed you "" when I've been home waiting, and I call customer service asking if they can just leave my package at a ups location and her answer is "" ma'am you would have to pay 7.99 if you want us to leave your package at a ups store""waited for 2 more days and still same thing no package I call UPS again and they still can't help me they still want to charge me. Why do I have to pay for their mistakes, unfair unprofessional. If I could I would give 0 stars, don't use UPS..."
Package is about to finally be here after placing it on the 30th and it having a mechanical error I placed orders that usps and Amazon deliver before this package came and I place this one first slow service at its finest exactly why I don’t use ups my Amazon order actually came in a day early so that’s what i call good delivery service ups needs to step up and actually care about their customers
"Dreadful… I ordered a package from eBay. Within 4 hours I received a text message to say they have my parcel and will deliver on the 7th. I received an email whilst I was at work to say they had delivered. I got back, no parcel, no calling card, I checked my ring cameras and UPS hadn’t even been to drop the package off. I rang UPS and was told they will send an email explaining the claim procedure. To fill a claim form you need to create an account to login. I thought the guy on the phone will be filing the complaint, I have no wishes to open an account with such a dishonest company. I didn’t ask for my package to be sent through UPS so why should I open an account with them???? They have clearly lied and I can prove this why should I go to the trouble toooen an account, their customer service need now to do the keg work, not me. I contact the company I purchased the item from in the hole that they won’t use UPS again."
"I only wrote a review on here a week ago due to the incredibly bad service from this company….. I actually can’t believe looking at the many , many complaints- that this delivery service is still operating?!
Words fail me to describe the lack of customer service, the incompetence of the drivers - I never want to be associated with UPS again"
"Terrible terrible company. Import tax payment gateway online doesn't work and the amount for 'government fees' doesn't add up when discussed with customer service. Paying on the phone doesn't update the depot, so drivers still refuse to deliver to address. Multiple 'failed delivery' attempts made that were never actually made, and the depots are useless / make no attempt to get in touch with you. Never buying anything with UPS delivery ever again."
"Shameless company, they charge you A LOT to give you a REALLY BAD service. I hired a pick-up and international delivery service, they told me that they would be picking up from 9am to 18pm of a wednesday and it is friday and they didn't come. I had to call customer service to reschedule a pick-up date and I'm still waiting... DO NOT USE IT IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY because you will pay for 48h delivery but they take their time, it is always more than 48h.
ADVICE: do not hire UPS"
They delivered on time. Charged lots of money. But my coat came covered in wrinkles.destroyed on the way to me by ups Inept transport care
"If I was able to give 0 stars I would. They do not work with people at all. People have jobs I had called multiple times to get a reasonable time drop of. In afternoon between 4pm to 7pm or be able to leave at ups store so I can grab it and on all occasions they were rude and said absolutely not and that I need to just stay home. Use anyone but them avoid them at all cost. Because if you are even lucky enough to get your shipment 90 percent of the time your product damaged /broken.
Worst delivery company out there"
I was meant to receive my delivery yesterday from 11:30am to 15:30pm UK Time but guess what…. it’s the next day and I’m still waiting.!!?
Worst delivery service! My package was supposed to be delivered 10/5 between 10 and 2. At 3 I check and it was changed to by 7pm. The next morning (which is today) we get the same messages as the day before. At 9:30pm my husband got a text update that our package was delayed due to weather. So now UPS can’t deliver because it was sunny and 80 degrees all day with absolutely no rain. I will NEVER use UPS or buy from any company that uses UPS to deliver my packages.
"The driver i felt was rude and asked her not be rude. She didn't want to bring my package up cause she is a ""5'1 woman"". She then tells me she can bring it up but if it breaks I would have to go return it. My dad couldn't help cause he is disabled. I couldn't because I'm a high risk pregnancy. So I tell her to leave it down stairs then. She then calls someone and starts talking crap about my dad and me while we are outside. I tell her we can hear her and she says ""who are you to me?"" She then tries to go past me with my package and I tell her to remove it from her dolly and put it on the ground. She then had the audacity to say ""no wonder you are a high risk pregnancy you are crazy."" All while she is STILL on the phone. I yelled at her as my heart broke at what she said to my face. She then tells whoever she is talking to on the phone that it's a ghetto apartment complex and gives my address to them. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE WITH THIS DRIVER."
"Support is horrible, the representive was short and sharp with me... I will never ship with UPS (United Parcel Snail). The Voice tracking is useless and the representive was even worse... I will never use them again for ordering anything.... How is this crap company still in business. I fully understand why their planes and trucks are BROWN!"
"Absolutely horrible customer service. All automated and can't speak to a live person about a problem with the parcel shipped. Tried various times on various extensions to get a hold of an ""agent"" but with no luck."
They lose packages and calls/emails go into a black hole. Worst company ever.
If I could give negative stars I would. UPS is worthless and shouldn't be allowed to deliver anyone's packages! All the drivers have the option to not deliver your package at their discretion! This cannot be changed and you can never count on getting your package at all! It will most likely be delivered to an access point rather than your door. This is what has been happening to me. I can not ever get my packages delivered to my door like I paid them to do! UPS is worthless!!!
"Sadley, the worst delivery company out there. I say sadley, because they were one of the original top three. Nevertheless, they do not care about on time, nor do they care if your package was football punted at the warehouse. Horrible service. If you care about your merchandise or your recipricant’s merchandise…..do not use!!!!"
"Never ship with UPS, had problems every single time!!!! They don't even know why.."
"Absolute worst customer service experience of my adult life. I needed a REAL human, not a bot. The service actually hung up on me 3x in a row and I never had the chance to speak to anyone at all. What a joke."
"Absolute nightmare experience. Extremely confusing process for international shipping, unhelpful and not knowledgeable customer service representatives, when they finally picked up my stuff half of it got returned to my home due to ‘invoice issues’ which makes no sense because all the invoices were the same!!! I try to reschedule the pickup, nobody shows up. I’m told over the phone I have to REPURCHASE THE ENTIRE SHIPPING ORDER. I do this and the rest of the packages are finally picked up. The delivery is rescheduled twice and three of the boxes completely lose tracking updates and show up randomly throughout the week after the whole shipment should have been delivered. Then I open one of the boxes and all of my perfumes have been removed, there is a note saying UPS won’t ship perfumes and I have to pick them up from their warehouse IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. I LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. Obviously I am never getting my perfumes back, and I’m sure that no matter who I contact at ups I will not be getting reimbursed. I will NEVER EVER be using UPS again, I am happy to pay far more money to never experience this again. Save yourself and DO NOT USE UPS."
"Had a package sent that needed a signature. I missed being home on the first day, so tried to follow the directions on the tracking webpage. Totally contradictory information. On the second morning it said it was out for delivery, so I made sure I was home all day. Turns out that it was delivery to the Access Point where I can pick it up. I called the Access Point, and the person there said to give them my name so they could be sure they had it. The reason being that the tracking webpage was not always correct that customers had come prior to arrival!"
"This is the worst delivery company in the world , first my package was reported lost and stolen but one of the works now they’ve been giving me the run around all day about giving me my stuff don’t recommend"
If I could give a 0 I would. This company is horrible. I used to think fedex was but no. I have a package sitting in a warehouse in the UK due to stupidity. They say it didn't have a complete label yet I have proof my label was complete. The shipper and I have gotten the runaround. We have no idea if the package is actually in the warehouse or where it is. For all we know someone has opened it has gone through it. Bc that is the only way the label would be missing hence the proof the label was not incomplete. These are the most incompetent people om the planet. I will officially go back to using fedex which I think are stupid in their own right if that says anything.
"Giving them two stars is me being gracious. I have had several packages that have been delayed for reasons like they “couldn’t find” the address, or the number in the address was incorrect when in reality they didn’t want to go down my drive way. I have the house number posted in three locations. Each time I have doubled checked the address and it was correct the drivers just didn’t want to go down my drive way."
This is the worst delivery company I have ever seen. I have lost multiple packages with them. Not sure where they keep delivering all my packages but there is no prove or picture or anything to indicate that package is at the right place. Don't ever use this horrible company
"There doesn't look to be a way to give nil stars.
One is one more than they deserve.

Complete lack of customer support.

See chat below for good example of how poor this company is.

Jenylin A: Hi, My name is Jenylin. I am reviewing your information and I will be with you in a moment.

Me:
So what is the email address for customer complaints in Australia?Jenylin A: Thank you for chatting and for giving me the chance to assist you. I am sorry if you got disconnected. please bear with me while reviewing the previous chat.
Me:
Federico D just passed the chat to a closed department after taking the xxxx out of me by telling me the parcel I was enquiring about had not been delivered.
Me:
Just please give me the email address of customer complaints in Australia.
Me:
That or contact details of UPS legal to take action against UPS now.Jenylin A: I do understand that you want a email address of customer complaint in Australia I wish I can be of assistance, however, this is considered as an International shipment. My area of expertise is with packages shipped within the 48 contiguous US states. Another options is to send an email using this link https : // www. ups . com/upsemail/input?loc=en_US
Me:
That is not helpful
Me:
what is the contact email address for ups complaints
Me:
Dear god it's a simple enough question.
Me:
It should be on the contacts page of your website.
Me:
Well?Jenylin A: I am really sorry unfortunately that is the only information we can provide to you since my are of expertise is with packages shipped within the 48 contiguous US states.
Me:
Are you deliberately trying to antagonise me?
Me:
in very simple terms WHAT IS THE EMAIL ADDRESS FOR CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS
Me:
if you refuse to provide that in the next response there will be 2 complaints. One about this chat session.
Me:
That link does not send an email.Jenylin A: The link I provide above that is the link where you can send a email you need to log in to UPS.com before you can sent an email
Me:
see above
Me:
and the correct email address (before I complain about your belligerence as well) is what?
Me:
so it should look something like xxxxxxxxx
Me:
we are clear?
Me:
I WANT THE EMAIL ADDRESS FOR COMPLAINTS
Me:
not a faulty link to a web page
Me:
and email address
Me:
an email address
Me:
not excuses.Jenylin A: I hope you understand that we can just also do so much. Unfortunately we don't have direct email address. I double checked the link I provided above and it is working. You need to log in hit next then provide the tracking number and hit next again then you will be rerouted to the send email
Me:
Then one for your legal team
Me:
Clearly UPS would prefer to be sued than to communicate with customers.
Me:
You had better find a manager if your next reply is not an email addressJenylin A: I am really sorry we don't have direct email address. If you are looking for manager unfortunately since we are only expertise packages within the 48 contiguous US states and our supervisor unable to make outbound call outside the US, I need to connect you to our international department. May I connect you now?
Me:
no.
Me:
The last person tried that
Me:
that was 3 hours ago and it is still waiting to connect"
Ups is absolutely the worst company in the history of the United States. They absolutely do not have any public relations and could care less if you receive your packages they were paid to deliver. Not only will I not use ups but I will no longer use any company that continues to use ups to deliver packages
"I sent a suitcase from Australia to Italy which was received on Monday 19/09 with an extra import tax of 55 euros, which was settled on the spot. On Wednesday 21/09 the same driver came back, with the same invoice, and requested further 55 euros, which was paid by an employee who was unaware of the previous payment. As this is a business, the transaction was caught on camera, so we sent the details to UPS right away, including the evidence of the payment on Wednesday (with screenshots of their driver).

I sent an email to UPS which was clearly ignored, as the only replied I got was ""Dear Client, the payment is settled"". Sure, settled twice on two different days - isn't this worth a thorough investigation? Apparently not.

No refund, no investigation on the driver, no reply or apology. This company doesn't care about their reputation, its clients or their service standards at all."
"A parcel was sent to me some weeks ago from England (I am in Chile). The parcel is still at a UPS office in England, and it is impossible to find out what has happened to it. The Virtual Assistant provides no information, and if one waits about one hour to speak to someone in Customer Service in England, they do not know what to do and do not care. An investigation was opened and closed with no result and without informing anyone. A complaint has been made, but no response has been received."
"I won't lie this is probably the worst delivery company I have dealt with. Package has not arrived on time the first time because ""the driver could not find the address"" while the correct information was provided all along. Next day some mysterious ""technical issues"" without further info. Secondly, customer service agents should know the language of the country in which they live in. This would avoid misunderstandings."
"WORTHLESS carrier.
UPS lost my car title, yet logged a time/date of delivery. I have a home video and delivery did not occur. Claims and ""support"" all exist online only. They allegedly tried to locate the package containing the title and couldn't. End of story. End of claim. No compensation, no apology, no communication, no responsibility taken.
They charged the car dealer I purchased from over $50 to overnight the title, then said they delivered it 5 days later, yet they have no idea where it really went. Again, WORTHLESS and IRRESPONSIBLE."
Terrible experience. Neither did they ring my doorbell nor did they call me . They just left a confidential package with someone I doesn’t even know and left me a mail stating that “left at office” It took me hours to find out the person and receive my package.
"Customs clearance were terrible. I was expecting a shipment came from Europe bound for the UK. All the information was provided, but they claimed they needed more information. The information that they requested transpired to be the information that they already had!! For some unknown reason, they assumed the package was arriving from outside Europe despite paperwork saying otherwise. the whole situation left me without goods for a month and then they tried to charge me for the service. I am still over a month into this with no goods...."
"Worst logistics/shipping company. Do NOT use. You are better off with FEDEX or DHL. Package took over 2 months to arrive. Only two items arrived unbroken. Was it used as a chock? Package was fragile, labelled as such and insurance paid. Tried to make a claim and it will not allow the claim!!! Regarding 2 month delivery. Called several times, they could not figure the address. I stayed home to recieved pacakge and they never stopped by, just tagged package as delivered online. When I called, they stated they didnt know where the address was so just marked as delivered. Next day they arrived at the address, no issues. If I could rate a negative I would. I will never use them again."
"They are by far the worse shipping company ever! I even paid for them to re-route my package to an access point and what do you know. They can't even deliver my package there on time. They literally wait until it passes the time they said they would deliver it by to update my shipment to show that it is delayed. What the actual crap. They said it would get delivered by 7pm and the access point closes at 7pm. They couldn't even try to deliver it before then. Mind you, I was following the delivery all day and they indeed were in the area, literally hovering over the access point 4 times today and still didn't deliver it. I'm so freaking upset."
"Awful, I paid overnight shipping for some animals they lost the package I’m assuming the animals are dead by now I would never use UPS when I buy something on Amazon I can track the package and they tell me how many stops until it comes to my house UPS is god awful and needs to update their technology"
"Bad customer service and delivery process is just unbelievably poor. Instead of delivering it to the address that was provided on the package, the delivery person assumed and decided that it’s ok to deliver it to the apartment complex office. At least leave a not on my door or something to let me know."
"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! How can you call this a “tracking” system? There is Noway to track your package and the window of delivery is between 7am - 7 pm SERIOUSLY
I had to take the whole day off work, it’s 6pm and still no package! Also customer service SUCKS!!!"
"Their tracking consists of when your package leaves the depot. No other info. 5 days later no update. The next update will probably be when it's on my doorstep. That's not tracking, those are departure & arrival notices.

And just try to contact them or speak with a human. They have no remote customer service that I can see. How are they still in business? Why do people still ship with them?"
"UPS has always been awful. They said my package was supposed to be delivered last week, and it wasn't. Then it was ""Out For Delivery"" yesterday and never showed up. Today it was also ""Out For Delivery"" and this time a notice was left on my door that a delivery was attempted. I was in my house on the same floor as my front door and they never knocked or rang a doorbell. Best part is this package isn't even a signature required package so there was zero point to putting a sticker on my door when they could have just left the package. Customer Service has no idea what they're doing and try to transfer me all over the place. Awful awful company and service."
"I was one day at home. No one ringed the bell, they just left me slip we missed you. Can't talk to a human, because their auto robot will not connect with someone to help. Worse service ever"
"I’m only giving them one star because I can’t pick zero stars. They have the absolute worst customer service and delivery service. Customer service lied to me twice and then told me my local depot would call me within the hour about my missing package, but again they failed to provide accurate info because I never received a call back or my package.
I will make sure from today forward that I will never order from another company that uses UPS as their delivery service. There’s an issue every single time! They have zero, ZERO 📣 respect for customers and for other peoples property.
I honestly think they have employees who steal parcels from people. Mine for example was an expensive electronic item that required a signature, and they still lost it ?!?
Just seems sketchy to me.
Don’t use this carrier if you don’t have to. They are the worst!"
"The most worthless f*ing shipping service I have EVER used. Every. Single. Time. I use UPS they have lost my package, claimed it has been delivered and are then impossible to reach and take no responsibility. Happenings again today. I am fuming.

HOW CAN A USELESS COMPANY LIKE THIS EXIST STILL?!?!!"
"Wish I could give UPS less than 1 star. Sent a package to return an item for refund which despite being tracked was never received by the retailer. I've been trying to raise a claim between UPS and the retailer and am getting passed from pillar to post. Just been told that as my claim is over 60 days old, I can no longer submit a claim. Absolutely disgusting service especially as ups are the ones who lost my returned package in the first place. Customer service aren't very customer centric or helpful and have told me there's no way I can get the money back as it's over 60 days. As they lost the package and aren't compensating me for that loss, I consider this theft. I will never recommend these thieves to anyone or use their service ever again. Absolutely disgusted and furious that I've lost money because of them."
"Worst company I ever used. I receive packages very often for my business. AVOID them at all costs. Not reliable, not responsible and horrible customer service. And from all the horrible reviews, one can see they don't care about anything but our money. They only way we could fight back is to not support them."
If I could give UPS zero stars I would. What terrible service. I just went on a trip and forgot all my meds. My husband went to UPS store to see about sending it to me as I was going to be gone for 8 days. It was a Saturday. They told him they could get it to me by Tuesday for $102.00. Are you kidding me. He went down the street to a Goin postal and sent it thru FedEx for $50.00 and I got it Monday at 1000. I will never use UPS to ship anything ever again. FedEx for the win!!!!!
"Terrible service, parcel going from Uk to Spain. Stuck at Madrid but no one asks you to fill out the POA for customs at Spain until you have chased and chased. Never use them such a shocking service"
"I have a horrible experience with them. The website is not work properly. I ordered a phone. I tried to make an account with them. The site is useless. They ""delivered"" my order yesterday. I was not home. I can not change anything on the site. I can not create an account in the uk.
So they delivered when I was not home. They sent me an email that they left a paper with further information. I've never got any paper from it. I can not check what did happen with my package now, because I did not have ""info notice number"" because I do not have any paper.
Good for nothing company."
I asked for revocation twice and received an assurance that the package would be returned to the sender. After which the parcel was delivered to the fraudster anyway. The customer service is misleading and the company's communication system is hopeless. I am very disappointed and will never use this shipping company again.
"If I'd give them a 0 I would. Ordered, paid extra for overnight on a Thursday, it is now Monday and still don't have it. Keep getting emails will be delivered next day.
Found out after I called Tuesday they said it was ""lost"" and investigate this. It was found a day later in Kentucky (I'm in PA). Got the package a week later."
They helped above and beyond with a pick up at my home. The driver was kind and extremely friendly and helpful! Thank you!
"I mailed a UPS package from Los Angeles to Clearwater,FL on 09/12/22. I was informed by the local shipper( The Mail Store) that UPS ground service would deliver it to Clearwater, FL by 09/17/22. The package was held at the Clearwater distribution center all day on 09/17/22. I spoke with the center mgr who stated that I could not pick up the package that day. The package was rescheduled for delivery on 09/26/22.UPS stated they attempted to deliver the package on that day..they did not.The receiver was at home at the time that UPS said they attempted to delivery the package. The call box was not used.The next day hurricane Ian impacted the area.The package was recovered on 10/03/22 at the Clearwater customer center, after a 2 hr wait. I will never use UPS again. Epic failure !!!!!"
They deliver our package at wrong address although it was correct address on the package. They said to file a claim which we did and from last 20 days they are running us around. . They said someone will call us soon or send us the email but from last 20 days no one did . I have all the proof and paperwork. I file a claim on September 21st and still waiting. Worst experience ever.
"Every time I have had a package delivered or planned to be delivered by UPS it is always a burden. My first package was incorrectly sent to a wrong state and then sent to the wrong city. My second package has been late on the estimated delivery date 3 times in a row. Both failing to meet estimated delivery date times put on their tracking website. Mind you, these packages are expensive and I live alone therefore I don't want to leave them exposed in my front porch so I had to call off work to be there on the volatile and incorrect delivery dates and time. Meanwhile, when I order with Amazon Prime I not only get fast delivery but I get a delivery on the exact date they estimated too. I have never had an issue with Amazon Prime delivery only with UPS."
"Worst shipping company around. They email u telling u a package has been re-scheduled and then an hr later send another email saying ""sorry we missed u"". No other company does this."
"Pros
Ordered items from Amazon
I called UPS Saturday October 1

Cons
I couldn’t choose my carrier
I couldn't give 0-star rating
My order was delayed Thursday 29 September due to delivery driver not being able to locate my address.

The order was rescheduled for UPS delivery 2nd time Friday 30 September

Saturday October 2nd package was supposed to be delivered but somehow the driver forgot to put it on his truck."
"Had to get some documents notarized for a house sale. Went to get notary services at UPS. They charged me $10.00 per page that they notarized. What a rip off. I had 7 pages and it took less than 7 minutes for them to notarize my 91 year old mom's signature for a house sale. This is unacceptable. If I could give a zero rating I would. Sadly my credit union did not have those services otherwise I would have gone there.for free. There are mobile notaries and I would recommend that you use those services because I can't imagine that they'll charge you $10 per page. Don't know if FedEx has this service but I will check them out. Regardless, I did not make copies there and took my business elsewhere."
"So I stayed home today because UPS said my package would be delivered between 9:15 and 13:15. It's 18:10 and their page still says that, but, alas no package. It's taken me 30 minutes of jumping through hoops and fire rings to actually speak to a human, who explained that my package is in fact still crossing the border somewhere in Germany. She promised to send me a link that _actually_ contains the status of my package for real, but, alas once more, no such email arrived yet.

I have a few questions to UPS:
- why bother making a fancy website if it contains lies? Who benefits from that?
- after you went through the effort of making a fancy website, why not to actually show something useful there, since, as it turns out, you have that information
- you subject your customers to this humiliating ATM quest just so they can speak to a human. Why do you hate us so much?"
"They hold you package and blame it on weather and the storm been gone, I see why they have very low ratings"
"UPS has some of the kindest delivery people but… that does NOT make up for the corporations complete lack of customer service. Need help? Here. Talk to some non-English person based on India who can’t help you. Delivery late? You’ll never know why and they won’t give you reasons. We got a late payment notice in our mail box for a shipment we received but there was a $0 fee listed on our UPS payment profile. Need that fixed? Just contact the non-existent customer service who will tell you they don’t know why you were charged until 12 months later when you get a call from COLLECTIONS and they tell you you now owe hundreds to UPS. Call UPS again and their response? “We don’t have any record of this.”

Seriously a mess of a company. We need more indépendant shipment companies so we don’t have to rely on the big bad three: UPS, USPS, and FedEx."
"I ordered a product that gave me 3-5 days delivery, sadly when I found out they were using UPS my heart sank! As suspected I was right, after the first so called attempted delivery where they used the excused the the recipient refused the order I called them, they were going to re-try. That happened 2 days later, same thing happened, they had my mobile, nobody called, I did not refuse the package. I explained that next attempt they needed to call me so I could give them info on how to get to my location. Today they told me it was delivered and received by a concierge, I did not receive it and it has been left at the incorrect address, this is a total nightmare! I am now waiting for a callback to get details, the package weighs 11kg so I can't just go and collect it! My next step will be to make a claim to PayPal to get a refund from the company I bought it from and re-purchase the product from another company who don't use this truly awful company!!!"
Worst experience ever. Customer service is non existent. The delivery said it would take 48 hours. I have been waiting 1 week and a half already. The box is sitting in their center because they refuse to send it to the relay point. Perfect.
"Amateurish and failed. Expected delivery on a Friday so stayed at home near front door, but got a 'failed delivery' email, although the driver had clearly not been to my house. Spoke to UPS customer service who twice promised that the local depot would contact me to explain and/or resolve the issue, but neither call happened. On the Monday I stayed at home again expecting a reattempt at delivery, and got a 'delivered' email although no package had been delivered to my house. To make matters worse, UPS would not tell me where the package had been delivered. Thankfully a neighbour suggested a street halfway across town with a similar name, which was in fact where the parcel had been left. A complete failure in every aspect."
Useless Peices of S**t.
"The courier knocked on my door however I was not able to answer as I was seeing to one of my children. By the time I answered the door, the courier had gone (understandably!). I phoned UPs to explain the situation. The call handler was understanding and said he will see if the courier will redeliver within the hour. The courier indeed came back with the parcel in less than an hour. I apologised to him however he was calm, sweet and professional. I wish all delivery/courier services were like UPs. I have never had a bad experience with UPs! Keep it UP!"
"Another ""woke"" upper management with the newly designed ""supply Chain"" that has ruined the logistics of what was great service. We now deal with stupidness that have no clue how to operate a delivery system and rely solely on a computer programmers idea of efficiency. Back tracking the deliveries all day creates frustration for the employee and if you haven't notice most don't care about the job and no interest in the company they represent, they could careless if it succeds now or not...Wake Up look around at what it was and what has been destroyed by the greed of the so called leaders."
"Unfortunate UPS,

I ordered my phone on T-Mobile

Waited for almost a month then kept delaying. And now the package went MISSING means got stolen.

Unfortunate"
"Package from Nashville, TN to Memphis, TN normally 1 day via USPS. Took 4 (four) days with freaking UPS."
"I give 1 star infact it should be -* ,terrible service, won't be using these or purchasing with anyone who does use them, customer care none at all,absolutely crap.."
"I am extremely disappointed and more than a little angry. My employer regularly sends packages to me from PA to CA. I understand that UPS Ground is not a guaranteed delivery date, but UPS consistently fails to deliver anywhere near the initially estimated date. I do not understand why UPS takes 8 - 10 days to deliver a small package 3600 miles over one of the most advanced highway systems in the world. My 20K pounds of household goods were shipped half that distance in two days.

Up to this point I have at least had tracking scans to give me some idea where my package is, but this time the fabled UPS tracking system has completely derailed. My package doesn't show a scan since being processed at origin in Horsham PA on the 23rd. When I called on the morning of the 30th, I was told the package had been in Oakland, CA, for over 24 hours. When I called later to see if it had left Oakland, I was told it was in Marysville, CA - not Oakland, and 150 miles from Oakland. Anyone who lives in Northern California knows that a trip originating from the Bay Area takes three times as long as from anywhere else on the planet, so there is little chance the package travelled those 150 miles in three hours. The customer service representative tried telling me I needed to contact my shipper, which defies logic. If the package was in fact in Marysville - 40 miles away from me at that point - what was my shipper going to do from PA? The supervisor told me I couldn't go pick it up, but that it would be delivered on Saturday the 1st. There were still no scans on the tracking past PA, so I had no proof that the package was even really in CA.

As I sit here tonight swearing I will never use UPS again, I receive a notification from UPS. I go to the app and one screen tells me the delivery will be scheduled as soon as possible, and the other is informing me that I will have my package Monday afternoon, which will be 10 days. The scans still show it in Horsham, PA. So, basically, the call center is incompetent, they can't deliver a one pound package of documents across the country within a reasonable period of time, the state of the art tracking system thinks the package is still in PA (where I am half afraid it actually is), and it is even odds whether the obviously outsourced and undertrained and having difficulty speaking English customer service representatives are outright lying to me. I am perfectly willing to pick the package up at its alleged location in Marysville, but I have discovered that location does not open on Saturday, so I am denied the joy of driving 40 miles to be told my package is in Timbuktu. I am over a barrel and completely powerless, except that I can put this story on every social media outlet. I'm sure nothing will be done - all I can do is hope that the package isn't lost or stuck in a truck wheel well or accidentally sent to NASA or inadvertently shredded or oops floating down the Colorado River somewhere, and that I will have the opportunity to work extremely late on Monday to process the documents in that package that should have been processed today.

Even moving the package 500 miles a day, which I could do in a 2012 Toyota Yaris while only driving during the day and regularly stopping to eat, get gas, walk the dog, and stretch my legs, should have resulted in delivery today. UPS really should be able to outdeliver a 56 year old woman in a 10 year old subcompact."
"UPS is the worst of the shipping companies. It doesn't matter if your package is at your local UPS 3 days before delivery date, they will sit on it for those three days.

If they delay on your package that is meant to deliver on a Friday, they will hold it till the next week. if you ask why they will say not scheduled for a Saturday delivery.

Horrible customer service and I dread any time someone ships with them."
I called to reschedule a delivery and was told it was changed after waiting on the phone for over 2 hours. Just to find out they didn’t reschedule the delivery and end up sending my package back to the manufacture.
"Ordered a large package and driver refused to leave at my door because it was up stairs so my package was left at the front entrance of the building, if package handling and delivery is what u are paid for, I don't see why it is an issue for it to be left at the correct place, the driver told me that yes it went upstairs but he would not be taking it there, was not his responsibility. I paid for the delivery!!!! Poor poor service and quality will be using FedEx in the future"
No way to ensure package gets delivered while you're not at home. Customer service doesn't speak English. Tracking page UI is horrible
"The customer support hang up on me, after repeating the tracking number, for the 3rd time, where she still didn’t got it right."
awful service and customer service even worst
"Honestly, I wish there was a ""minus"" star option. This company, how is it still existing? We ""cancel"" people for saying wrong stuff, how is this company not ""cancelled""? Deliveries are late. All items I have ever expected delivered by you are ""incorrectly sorted"". At this point, I am not sure I get my package overall! How hard is it to send an update at least? Moreover, you always say I was not at home when you attempted to deliver. Well I work from home, so why you show me that bull**** ? If you can't operate your business, why you exist? Sell the company to someone, who'll bring order and will focus on Customer Experience or hire an agency to fix it for you. At this point I won't even purchase in my fav store until they break a deal with you. Seriously, pigeon post is more reliable than you..."
"If I could rate them zero stars I would!!! They said my address didn’t exist. I call customer service and they tell me there’re sorry the driver couldn’t find my address, and that I can have the package held at their facility so I can pick it up but for a fee. They said they will be charging me $7.99 to pick up MY package that they couldn’t deliver at their warehouse. So in essence they are charging me to pick up my own package. I go online they tell me I can change the pick up location myself and after I signed up they charged me $5.99 to give them information on how to fine my house. This has been the worst experience I’ve ever had with a delivery company!"
I was expecting a very important package today. Got notified it was delivered I was home and I went to retrieve it and it wasn’t there.Tried for several hours to get a live person but was directed to their terrible website. After struggling and finally get a message to them. They sent an attachment that I could not open. Asked in several emails to resend and no response. So I know this was not delivered.
"UPS is trash!!! FedEx is so much better than this joke of a company. I would prefer for the USPS (post office) to deliver my orders.
UPS always lies and says they attempted delivery. Lying fools. I have been home for days and there are several of us here, one of us would have heard anyone making a delivery, but 2 days in a row they said ""we missed you"" No one even needs to be at home for delivery to be made anyway!
UPS IS USELESS, DO NOT USE THEM!"
Absolute garbage courier. I order a package with tracking. It tells me that the package is being delivered. Shortly after they said the package delivery attempt was made but wasnt delivered. Three people sitting at home and no door bell ring or notice of delivery. Shortly after they claim that the brokerage fee wasnt paid thats why it wasnt delivered. I payed the fee online with email confirmation it was paid. I call customer service they tell me the package will be delivered the next day between 11-3. Next day arrives and no package. I get notice saying delay till the following day. Next day arrives and no package. Still waiting on the package as we speak after being told by 2 different customer service reps its coming.What the hell is going on with this courier? Ive had things come across the globe from other couriers faster then this. This is an embarassment in this day and age for a company to be this incompetant and disorganized. My package has been in transit for 3 days in my area.
"UPS truck driver leaves a sticker stating I was not home and knocks my door , when I opened the door, driver was in his car and left . No intention to leave my package."
"We are supposed to receive a package 9/27/22. UPS says “we missed you and taking your package to a local UPS Access Point” without even actually trying to deliver it? Me and my wife waited the WHOLE Day for the package and this is what we got. No phonecall, no miss call, no message, no doorbell, they just posted a letter to a wall thats not even our wall maybe to say “oh we attempted to deliver it”. My god is this how you guys work? Very very disappointing. Who ever the delivery guy is, is so lazy, needs to get fired does not deserve his job. They told us that our package will be delivered to the designated UPs Access Point the next day which is 9/28/22. guess what, it is already 9/29/22 and our package is still NOT in the UPs access point. Seriously, they don’t really care about you or your item. Never had issues with Fedex or Amazon prime deliveries. We ended up processing a refund/cancellation with TMobile. Next time we are receiving a very important package, need to make sure it wont be UPS. Period!"
"A $7000 check from my mortgage company, another incompetent outfit, was entrusted to these clods only to have it disappear the day of delivery. Of course their useless tracking system said it was delivered but of course without a shred of proof, no signature, no photo showing envelope on properly, nothing. Nothing except that it was delivered to Greensboro NC. So it was delivered to the city. Brilliant! Worthless, lying thieves"
"The worst crap I've ever used. First, they delayed it a day and told me it'd be delayed by a day, fine that's ok, then the day that the package was actually supposed to come on it didn't.
It has been in the same place for more than 10 hours since the message at 6.00 am that they sent (On the way). The package was supposed to come at the latest 2:00 pm and now it's soon going to be 8:00 pm...
Where is my damn package UPS?!"
"My parcel was shipped from Canada to the US. I paid for the next day delivery service. The next day I tracked and it said delivery attempted because they didn't receive the payment. I called their number. The machine asked for the tracking number and then responded that the number did not exist. I tried to do research online and figured it could be the customs clearance fee. I used different avenues and got their contact number that I could talk to someone there. They said it's the US customs and I need to pay with the US UPS. They transferred me to the US side. And I talked to a machine that again didn't recognize the tracking number. I called them again. They said oh no we will transfer you to the US brokerage number for support. The guy who answered my call said oh we haven't received your payment. In order to deliver the parcel, you must pay $$$. I told him I paid the fee yesterday to get my parcel shipped. He said I had to contact Canada UPS to get my fee updated on the system. I called the Canada UPS again and they said I had to fill in the form so that I could pay the customs clearance. I asked then when my parcel will be shipped. She said it will be on Monday. And that's what they called next day delivery. No one at UPS mentioned with me when I shipped my parcel that next day delivery means it would take 5 days to be delivered. Noone asked me if the sender or the receiver would pay for the customs clearance. If you can, please don't be like me. Please choose another courier that you can TRUST. Please choose another courier that you won't be as frustrated as I am right now. I shipped my parcel yesterday (September 29) and I just ended up conversations literally 5 minutes ago before I jumped on here for this review. I am the person who never left any review even if the service is really bad. But this experience outnumbers all other horrible experience. So UPS deserves a review for their extremely bad service. I wish there's a -10 star rating that I can rate."
They don't deserve one star....their workers are lazy...pure freaking lazy!!!! And their management lies to cover the workers butts and their own....bunch of lazy freaking people...no wonder they can't keep workers...at least loyal trustworthy workers!!!! If ya can't do your job then find a different one that will put up with lazy people!!!!
The driver I’ve had has truly made me and my dogs happy. They leave bones for my dogs and I truly wish I could be home when they’re there to thank them. They’re sweet and great with my deliveries. I believe it is 120-TAYMARK.
"LIARS & UNRELIABLE
I would rate -5. I have never had a positive experience with UPS ever. I can never speak to someone competent. Delivery drivers lie about delivering packages either saying they delivered it and no one was there to sign or saying they delivered it while still in route. On September. 28th 2022. We wasted the whole day waiting on a machine we needed for our business. After 7:30/8:00pm the delivery driver leaves a “Sorry we missed you” note. No knock, no ringing of the doorbell, no nothing but a dang note. So the next day we go to the pick up location and they didn’t receive it or has yet to receive it at the time. Even though UPS tracking updates stated, it was at pick up location. The pick up location was at a random Tobacco shop. Overall, I would not recommend UPS at all to anyone. I would even go as far as not purchasing from places that use them a the only form of delivery. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE IF YOU CAN!"
"always same bullsh*t with UPS!!! don't ring the bell don't ever wait, and don't leave the note to pick up point!!
AMAZON PLEASE GET RIDE OF THEM!!"
"I have 2 emails from UPS one stating delivery from 08:30 to 12:00 and the other stating delivery 08:30 to 12:30.It is now 16:10, nothing delivered. I have been in all day waiting for the delivery. When I use the UPS tracking system, it is exactly the same as early this morning. It is a disgrace."
"AWFUL! Never use UPS. Looks cheaper then other companies price wise but there are so many issues with the service: I tried to create a shipping label online following their procedure twice, and two times they took the money but no label. No one could help in the customer service center, they are kind and want to, but their system does not allow them to find your shipment details unless you have your tracking number. Their solution to the problem is to create an account. After losing time and money the last thing I would do is create an account. Lost trust in them, completely not serious. I hope they refund me. Spent half a day trying to sort it out only to lose time and money and the shipment still did not depart. Choose a better company."
"Everytime I order a parcel that is delivered by Ups it is not delivered and they say nobody was in. They are lazy liars, we live on a farm that has 2 full time men on the yard, myself, my husband and daughter all work from home, my au pair is in the house all day long and I have 40 horses on the yard on a DIY basis so one of the owners is always on the yard. I would no longer buy from a firm that uses Ups for their deliveries."
"Had to deliver a carry on suitcase with clothes and personal items from Brussels to Lisbon, paid extra to do the fastest delivery possible. I've never received my suitcase, after 2 months of trying to contact them and doing many claims, they informed me that they had lost my luggage. I had to fill many documents to ask for a refund, when the process was completed they just refunded me 200 euros because that's the value I put in the initial form for the delivery (i'd never imagined they would lose my luggage, just made a quick calculation) but the total costs are around 400 euros and they refused to refund that. Worst customer service and experience ever, I think they've stolen my luggage for sure"
"I'd give UPS zero star if I could. Absolutely horrible customer service. I called Sept 27th and was assured my packed would be delivered. I stayed home for this reason as the shipment couldn't be left outside due to it's contents and the weather. It wasn't delivered and so I called back and was told it would be delivered the following day. I requested a specific time for delivery for said reason the package couldn't be left outside. I was told I'd be contacted which didn't happen.
I called the day of the new expected delivery date and the lady I spoke with was extremely rude speaking over me whenever I started speaking.Telling me ""I MUST be understanding"" and also telling me ""I will not transfer you to a supervisor"" after I requested one. She then had the audacity to transfer me a Spanish department.
I eventually spoke with another agent and was told a supervisor would call me. I am not surprised that this also did not happen.
This is the service I received after spending $102.77 CAD for shipping. NEVER AGAIN!"
I was sent a package by my cellphone company and the driver shows up at 3 p.m. wanting a signature! what normal working person is at home to sign for a damn package. I called the sender and they said that is not their requirement and had never heard of it. I have had many many packages phones included delivered and left with NO problem. There was no address to go pick it up or anything. So I tried calling the 1800 number. it did everything it could to keep from having to connect me with someone. when I got someone online they spoke little english. This company is garbage and I hope amazon wipes them off the map
They are the worse. They just drop your boxes on the ground and in the open for anyone to steal. THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!
I beg you UPS please for the love of god stop out sourcing your support calls internationally!!!
"A UPS driver sped past my house in excess speeds doing 20km over the speed limit. I called to report a “dangerous driver” to which the dummy replied “Why are you reporting a dangerous driver?” Verbatim. After a serious language barrier(or ignorance) I asked to speak to a supervisor. He put me on hold three times comeing back after a minute to tell me the supervisor was busy. So he asked to transfer me to a complaint department. I say of course. He transferred me to employee checking for UPS in the states!? I’m in Canada. This confused me and the guy who answered. I got transferred back to the same department. They asked why I called “I’m calling to report a dangerous driver” response? “Why do you want to report a dangerous driver?” Safety is low on their importance. Given this call took me 45 minutes to ask them to be safer for their drivers and our neighborhoods, you’d think they would respect my time more. Now I sit and wait for another call to report the dangerous driver. What a joke!"
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. UPS continues to deliver much later than said and offers no explanation or way of making the situation better. Terrible!"
"Deliveries get delayed ... I get that.

But seriously EVERY SINGLE TIME ???

What drives me up the wall, is every single time it arrives a day late, and every single time its an 'exception .. '

Status: Exception

A UPS thing that is excluded from a general statement of normality or does not follow a rule example next day delivery always takes two days ..."
"I have never, in my four years at my current address, had a positive experience with UPS. They mark shipments as delivered, when they were stolen at the distribution center. Or they deliver a shipment several hours after saying it was delivered. Or they get their tracking numbers crossed, so that my incoming shipments vanish into the ether and something completely unrelated shows up on my account (but not my doorstep), making it impossible to resolve with the sender. How the #$%^&* do these incompetent jackholes stay in business?"
THE WORST EVER!! They make you pay lots of money and they don’t even pick up your package… and then it takes an hour to get a hold of customer service which says it will take 3 days for my package to arrive even though I PAID EXPRESS PLUS which says on the website that it arrives the next day early morning. Absolutely horrible company! You should shut it immediately!!
UPS package requiring a signature cannot be rerouted to a UPS pick-up station for reasons unknown. Live chat dropped after more than 30 min. No response to email.
They only reason I'm rating it one star is because no star isn't an option. They lost my package. I can't even talk to someone competent. And the people who handle my package can't even help. So I guess the 600 dollars I spent on my item was wasted. If you gotta ship something go through FedEx at least they are competent.
"I worked with both UPS and FedEx from 1988 to 1995 as an independent shipping center. We had complaints and threats of law suits due to UPS on a weekly basis, but did not have such issues with FedEx except for cost of shipping with FedEx. For the last two weeks, I have been attempting to get my packages delivered to a local UPS access point through UPS My Choice after I set this option up in the application and UPS continues to deliver my packages to my residence which are being destroyed by my dogs, which is the reason to have them delivered to the UPS access point. Amazon provides an option within their delivery instructions in their site to make special instructions, which they do and I am able to avoid this problem. I know, put the dogs away so they can't get to the packages, but that won't work for me in this case. Why is it that UPS is the only shipper that I have this issue with and my stuff gets damaged, I know the reason but it wouldn't be gentlemanly of me to say so for all to read. With a customer rating of 1.2 stars and thousands of reviews, how is it that UPS stays in business."
"I wish l can give 0 stars but the system doesn’t allow. Yesterday l was told from Stafford UPS processing center to stay home from morning until 7:00pm because a package was going to be delivered and needed my signature. I was seating next to a window that faces my entrance door until 4:03pm when l checked my phone and l saw the notification that started a series of lies.
—First lie “attempted delivery 4:01pm, we are sorry we missed you”. At 4:05pm I called the Stafford again and the same employee named Jeanette responded. I was very frustrated and explained to her that the driver was not telling the truth . I didn’t see anybody coming to my door, my 8 cameras didn’t show anybody and my Ring didn’t show anybody coming from UPS. I offered to send the footage to them but l was told they believe in me so no need for the footage.
— Second lie. Also she told me to stay home unti 8:00pm because the driver was coming back to deliver the package and the supervisor was notified. At 6:55pm l called back Stafford and l was told the package was not coming because the driver finished his job at 6:00pm.
I called UPS and created a case and l was told that the day after a supervisor will call me.
—Third lie. The day after nobody called me and the excuse was that the employee didn’t put it like Emergency. So l was told that now it is signed like Emergency and somebody will call in two hours.
—Fourth lie. Nobody called. I called them and was told to wait home until 4:30. I missed another day of work. Called Stafford again and was told to wait until 7:30pm
It is passed 6:30 pm and no delivery yet.
I used UPS for my business for two decades. But that’s not the way to do business. They don’t care about their customers.Horrible service."
"If I can do minus 5 stars I would. The worst courier experience I’ve ever had. They shouldn’t exist. End of the story. At the end of the day I paid the VAT to them 2 times and not 23% but almost 45% Doesn’t make sense - I know. Welcome I the UPS world.
Ps: courier left parcel at the door nearly outside and run away."
"They have repeatedly lied about delivering packages to my home and business. They had even said that they attempted to deliver to my workplace a few times (different deliveries), stating that we were closed during lunchtime. Our front door NEVER closes. It’s our policy. I’ve had to call and complain to UPS about their drivers lying, on multiple occasions. The drivers eventually show and give me the package with an attitude. I wish I didn’t have to use this company for my orders. We use FedEx for all of our products because UPS is so unreliable."
"Awful, awful customer service. Constantly being cut off phone when calling.
I am being charged VAT on a non VAT item (Helmet) and even after supplying UPS with the details from HMRC Gov website they still do nothing. I suspect it is a scam and they are making a fortune from these fake charges.
Please use another company for your deliveries"
UPS lied several times about where my package was!!!!! So Frustrating! Do NOT use them!
Ups are hopeless times and contact nightmare avoid at all costs if you can
"ups in netherlands NOT REACHABLE BY PHONE!!
if package is lost or delayed there is no way to contact ups about this.
VERY BAD SERVICE, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
paying for express delivery and did not get the service and was not able to reach ups"
"I ordered fruits from Cali to Nola, paid $53 for over night but it got delayed and came 5 days later. All the fruits in the box got rotten because of the heat. I paid so much for the fruits and delivery but Ups refused to take responsibility and said that as long as it was delivered, they were not responsible for what in it. Absolutely horrible. Sorry! I would give -0000000000 stars if I could. Please close down and disappear!"
"UPS delivering packages at 8:30pm is a f***ing joke. All the lights off in the house and the dumbass driver drops the package and rings the doorbell. Dog starts barking, baby wakes up. Give your f***ing a head a shake. Very unimpressed"
"UPS BD asked me a 5X higher import duty than the online retailer's estimation, the support staff have no knowledge beyond few generic process.
I had to cancel the order for a loss."
"UPS is a disappointing company. They give you a delivery date but it never fails that they'll push delivery back by a day or two. Who's worst Fedex, UPS or DHL. They're all horrible and never deliver when they say they will."
Packages sometimes arrives
Terrible. They said attempted delivery but I WFH and work by the door. Why dont they just leave the package?
"My package was delivered today after being delayed. It was left in the middle of my long driveway, halfway between the mailbox and the house. The driver must have slowed down and just tossed the package into the driveway.
All of this despite my request on their website that all packages, which usually contain medical supples, be placed on the front porch.
I have complained about this each time a package is delivered. It has done no good so far.
When given the opportunity, I always request any other delivery services instead of UPS. FedEx is the best. They place my packages on the front porch as requested."
"I shipped a package via UPS overseas in May 2022
Brand new Samsung 43 inch TV from Best Buy straight to UPS. They charged me $696.99 to ship it to the Caribbean. When my husband went to pick up the TV at UPS the entire screen was cracked upon delivery. The Ups rep filled a claim with UPS due to damage. It is now September 26, 2022 and I have been calling UPS only to be told to call the UPS I shipped it from, transferred all over the place from person to person
I dont have a thousand dollars to give UPS
Most horrible customer service ever and I still cant get my refund!
Going to write a letter to corporate since no one reads the notes on the account from my calls since May"
"I am on disability so i order most items i need online. Amazon delivery is good, Fed Ex is good, USPS is good, UPS, awful! I have a UPS package sitting in Cheyenne, one hour away from me, for two full days now. This one is their ""Smartpost"", where they give it to the USPS for final delivery. Most of my deliveries from them are just UPS alone. Either way, they are always the slowest of any of my deliveries."
"Never once had a good experience with them, they always either lose my mail or damage it. This most recent time, my tracking hadn’t been updated in 3 weeks so I figured it was lost, only for it to show up in my mailbox half open and the items inside super damaged."
UPS are all thieves do not trust them. I got a package delivered for my birthday and the average package was only $40 and everything had been payed for the delivery. UPS won’t let me receive my package unless I pay $40 and for two weeks they are holding my package from me. Why should I pay $40 when it’s already paid for as a gift for me? Whenever I call them they won’t let me talk to any supervisor or manager. What a scam this is just stealing peoples money.
Very Good customer service with Reekia from the Fayetteville NC store great overall.
"Want everything handed to them, then lose the packages, or take 4 days to deliver a priority overnight package. They're getting as bad as FedEx!"
Package was addressed to deliver to my exact home address. Checked track shipment and it stated it was delivered to a neighboring city only about 10mins away from me. Track shipment only stated the city and state it was delivered to. It took me all day to finally get in contact with someone that was able to find exactly where my package had been delivered to. She made it seem as if it was my fault not allowing me to speak and stated I must update my address in the UPS app as it was delivered to my “old address”. I mentioned I have never lived at that address nor in that city and I DO NOT have the UPS app or a UPS account. She then stated it will be picked up from the location it was wrongly delivered to the following day and it will be delivered to my home address the day after that. I am currently still waiting on delivery as I can not even follow up as they are not answering my calls
Paid for 2 day delivery and it’s on day 4 now I call for refund on the shipping and the customer service agent gets really defensive and says in his system it shows the driver tried to deliver it when it was suppose to arrive but didn’t. I have cameras there was never once a ups truck in my driveway and I ask if he came by why didn’t he leave the package and he said sometimes they don’t feel safe to leave packages that it’s up to him and refuse to refund my shipping. Ups are bold face liars and I’ll never use them again.
"One of the worst customer service experiences I’ve had. Spoke to managers that lies about what they were doing just to get me off the phone. Bella and Sherika. Sherika was rude and loud, and Bella told me she would call me back and let me know the status of my package being shipped, 4 TIMES. No calls back at all. This has happened twice. Will do everything in my power to never use UPS again."
Literally 80% of the time a package shows up it's either completely destroyed or the contents inside are laying on the step by the front door. UPS does not even care if a package even shows up in good condition or not and when you go to file complaint all you get is I'm sorry you feel that way. This place is turning just as evil as what Amazon is.
"Never rang the doorbell, just left and claimed there was no-one to give a signature. Unacceptable."
"UPS is a horrible company bordering on scam. Just a list of recent issues I have had with them: 1. They delivered the package to wrong address and lied that they have delivered it to my house. I only found out later when my neighbor from a street over came by and gave me the package. 2. They show an estimated date of delivery and not deliver then reset the estimate without any explanation or apology. 3. They require an account to email customer service to follow up on issues and when I tried to use my account it was not working and the reset functionality was broken just saying ""there was an error"" and there was no way to follow up.

I am not sure why people still use their services. They are absolutely terrible and I would never willingly make use of their services."
"92% of UPS reviews are 1 star… do I really need to say more? No real people to call for customer service. When they miss a delivery you have to pay for alternative options. Missed deliveries happen, but to have zero valid options for customer service is obnoxious. If you have any other options for shipping, do not use UPS."
"Sitting here waiting for a package that was shipped ""one day air"" that should have been here no later than yesterday. According to their so called ""tracking"" it sat at the hub where it was dropped off almost 24 hours before it was scanned to be shipped out. Of course their ""tracking"" has already scrubbed this information, but I have made screenshots of everything. Basically I will have paid the exorbitant price for one day delivery, but got delivery in 3 days. I will make every effort possible to never use UPS again. They are disgraceful. Will use FedEx from now on. This had occurred on 9-24-22 not 9-23-22 as recorded as date by Trustpilot."
"Just adding myself to the horrible reviews, customer service starts talking to each other when you try to explain the issue, they just check the info you already have through the app and answer you based on that.
Most of the drivers are even WORST. I noticed they took out the live tracking, one Saturday I saw a driver staying in the SAME PLACE for more than 4 hours. and then I got a notification that they attempted delivery but no tag was left/. Recently got 2 phones on separate orders, one was delivered to reception (got lucky there) the second one with the SAME ADDRESS was not delivered because of missing info. (I added the missing info through the shipper and after 3MINUTES they were added they notified me that I REFUSED THE PACKAGE). Nowadays a lot of companies don't care and suck, but UPS definitely beats them all."
"Literally the worse company you could possibly think of.

Sent 2 packages to Spain for moving reasons. After 2 weeks of sending countless documentation and calling customer service on a daily basis I had to return both packages to the UK because they were both charging me for having the package waiting for clearance and not giving me any alternatives.

If you are moving somewhere else like me. Just pay for an extra bag and bring it with you in your flight. Avoid at all costs, you’ll thank me later."
"Broke my stuff and then claimed my packaging did not meet their standards. I paid for the insurance but they insist the packaging wasn't up to standards.
They never inspected the packaging...
They asked for the phone number of the parcel receiver but never called them. They refused to look at photos of the packaging before it was sent or photos provided by the receiver of the damaged packaging and the damaged goods.

In other news, they failed to collect the items on the specified day, returned the following day and they are currently trying to bill me for two collections. The failed one and the late one.

The worst experience you could imagine from a courier, a string of failures and refusal to take responsibility."
"Basically, they said they delivered a package but they didn't. They suggested it was stolen and then suggested I walk through the apartment complex to see if it had been delivered to a similar address. I tried to file an on-line claim which didn't work because the claim site didn't accept the tracking number UPS gave me to track the package. Throw in 3+ hours of calling, re-entering information and AI masquerading as a human on their chat. Business people! Don't use UPS. The lack of customer service rubs off on you!"
"First, they shipped my package in the wrong direction, which delayed the delivery. Then the driver claimed that they ""attempted delivery"", but I've been at home all day waiting specifically for this package, and no one came to my door. I called them and they responded that the driver was ""too busy"" to attempt a 2nd delivery. I told them multiple times that the driver had NEVER attempted, and they told me to just go pick up my package from my local UPS store in 3 DAYS!"
"Always late, tracking never works, and drivers lie about no one being home. Given a choice, I NEVER choose UPS for a delivery service."
"They force you to register to get detailed tracking status. Which upset me. Also, they continually give an estimated delivery and even show a map with the truck nearby even as close as a football field away only to go right passed the house and go further away. To top it off after an hour past their initial delivery estimate elapsed they take the map away and update the estimate to the end of the day"
"Absolutely the WORST! UPS picked up 12 boxes from me scheduled to be delivered by 1030 the next day to my office. They lost 9. Eventually I received all but one, the most important part. The troubling part was the complete indifference and lack of follow thru. I called at least 8 times and spoke with one bad agent after the other. UPS is horrible for reliable delivery. I cancelled my account. Im going with FEDEX. Never again UPS!!"
"This service is an insult to dignity.
The deliveries are fake, I took tenths of permissions from work to stay home for UPS deliveries and never got the packages, but once. Causing stress with work and frustration, and having to do the job I paid for already.

Delivery personnel does not even pass by, in fact no notes are left in the mailbox other than the obvious missed bell opportunity they had, since guess what – they-d have found out I was actually home every singletime. Plus the automated customer service informs me that the company will attempt 3 times before parking item in the UPS station which is a lie, since 10 minutes after expected delivery time I get already a confirmation that items can be picked up 1.3 KM away from my place, which for large boxes is a total pain!

Feedback to the management: change your business entirely and sell JOKES instead.

I will never EVER order products by companies that deliver with UPS. End of frustration."
Never get your parcell on time costermer service rude not helpfull
Ups marked my package as delivered! The driver never came to my house! They got it where you can only email them which is ridiculous because they agents say different stuff! They haven’t refunded me! FedEx where never act like they have! I wish I didn’t have to get any packages through them! They drivers are marking packages as delivered so they can steal them! They are condone this! They need to make them take a pic of it like most places! They customer service is horrible!
I hate ups and this is not the first time that I ordered a package paid 15.00 rushing fee then I get a message from them saying my package was delayed. I spoke with customer service she wasn’t helpful at all. What y’all need to do ups is give me my money back for my delayed package and my rush fee. I’m tired of y’all with this Same mess. Hire more people do something this is not acceptable.
As a business we do have opening hours and UPS drivers keep coming while we are closed leaving no notes in the mail box no emails from ups mentioning that they have attempted a delivery. From there all our parcels are sent back to our suppliers. And of course they do have excuses when calling them the funny thing is that they have different excuses for each call :) UPS compared to DHL and DPD it's actually not comparable.
"Perfect for my little one, the delivery was quick, all was intact and of course unbeatable prices."
Terrible company! This is the second time this company has lost my package! I called to figure out where my item was and needless to say no one was helpful! They told me there was nothing they can do and I need to request for a refund. They didn't even look for for it. They brushed me off. I hate UPS
"I ordered a few dresses from Shein. The package actually came alittle early, the only thing is… it got delivered to the wrong address. I called UPS spoke to a representative and she tracked down the driver. I explained to her if she could get the driver to describe the house he dropped it off to and he did and it was not my house. He drove back to the house,l. Thankfully the owners were not home, but still anyone seen it walking by or driving would have snatched it. He collected the package and brought it to me. My suggestion would be to do what Amazon does and have the drivers take pictures of the package when it gets delivered. I live by a school and I thought one of the kids that walk home seen it and grabbed it. I wasn’t mad, I was happy to get it back"
I had been waiting for My Family Olive Oil for the Past 3 Months . This Is how long It took to get here from the time my family dropped It off at the Delivery station In Greece . There were two Boxes They came Overseas with No problem . UPS Double packed both boxes and shipped them to my house .In Florida . The driver left only one box. Didn't ring the doorbell to tell me that the other box has a problem or anything ! A few minutes later I get a text that the box was bent and it was leaking and it was discarded . Nobody has communicated from UPS about this matter . I never prefer ups I don't know how this company brought my products here . And MESSED UP my order. My order which has MONETARY value and EMOTIONAL VALUE . And UPS messed it up . UPS sucks In simple words and I Wil Not prefer them ever
absolutely abysmal. absolutely the worst experience ever... don't even try
Didn't buy a package but over here at the Crofton United Methodist Church UPS driver Pulls in park and lot and I guess he went in the back and peed In a bottle and then dumps it out in the church park and lot.If you had to pee there's gas stations right there in town hucks and ideal market who has bathrooms.
UPS is the worst I am so mad that companies trust them with delivering equipment it is so upsetting that something so simple would cause them to postpone delivery so now it’s another day my job duties is delayed I mean it is asked that a number be provided so if you are in the area why not make a courtesy call if problems occur you do not know how significant that package is please do better
"Good effing grief this service sucks donkey balls. Packages are ""missed"" half the time and they always end up having to be picked up at an access point. I don't even go outside so there's no reason anybody should be missing me. Are y'all even trying? Absolutely incompetent, useless service. USPS would never do me like this."
I bought my college supplies and paid $10 for UPS to ship it to me. I just received a notice that I missed them and I was home all day. Now I have to pick it up at o e of their locations. If this was the case I could have picked up my package at my college for free. This is unbelievable!
"Almost impossible to get through to their customer service. When I finally did after several days, I was met with arrogant and lying personel who refused to help. The whole experience with them has been terrible. The delivery, their customer service, their website... never use UPS"
"They lost the parcel the first time, late delivery the second time."
"You need to urgently start facilitating customs payments online through your website, it is unacceptable for you to expect us to hand over cash/cheques to the delivery driver - this is the 21st century. Or you could just send an email with customs charge invoice and bank transfer details."
On time and carried out special last minute delivery request
Efficient and helpful service. Thanks.
"My delivery came 2 days early, which is rare because I live in a remote rural area. Rather a lot of emails telling me updates that all seemed to say the same thing - but that's ok."
"This is the worst courier service with a lying customer service centre and the worst tracking details. The delivery people do not even attempt to deliver at people's residence and they want all couriers to be collected at the depot. Luckily i saw the ups truck standing close to my residence, i knocked on the door and asked the delivery person to give my package which i was in follow up with them for above 14 days. If i had not done the needful, the delivery person would have escaped with the package. I am not sure but this can be further investigated if they have a true intent of delivering people's packages or they have an intent of keeping the packages for themselves."
"I have never dealt with poorer customer service than UPS. From their voice guided menu trying at all opportunities to not let you speak to anyone, to their foreign customer service with terribly hard to understand broken English, they are the worst customer service I've ever dealt with by a long shot! Don't even get me started on their archaic website to try get anything done. They really need to tighten up their customer service game! It is downright pitiful!!!"
"Package with signature confirmation was to be delivered, driver never came and said he made a 1st attempt. We have security cameras and he never attempted a delivery and no notice was left.

Next day driver claimed a 2nd attempt was made. I was out side waiting for the delivery when I got a text saying they made a 2nd attempt. He never showed up and cameras show he never came. Of course no notices were left.

Called UPS and explained the problem operator said he would have dispatch call me within an hour. Call never came.

Next day called UPS again and explained the reoccurring problem of driver lying about making delivery attempts. Operator says he will have a supervisor call me, I told him that was suppose to happen yesterday and I have no faith in that. He says he sees they tried to contact me but could not and states ""that strange you were waiting for that call"" I told him they are just lying and I need that package and want it delivered to a UPS store, So UPS charges $7.99 to have it delivered to a drop off location. So I had to pay extra because they are to lazy to do their jobs.

So, today the driver actually did his job and the package arrived. Now let see if they are going to refund the $7.99 to me or just rip me off."
"This place only got on star because 0 was not an option. Absolutely the worst shipping company, not only are they over priced but like to change up the expected date. I paid the 2 day shipping and they pushed it out but did not refund the money charged, absolute trash of a company."
Awful website. Worst I've seen.
"Useless. Newer buy anyting where ups ships your packages...
This company is scam.."
"VERYYY horrible service. They lost my package and could not tell me where it is. The workers don’t know how to help. They are very unorganized and I’ve asked about 4 times where my package is, they could not/ did not answer my question. They just told me that they’ll have someone get back to me. UPS is a horrible delivery company and they lose your packages. Now I have to wait 2 weeks to get a refund due to them delivering my package to the wrong address."
"I can't count how many problems I've had with UPS, so many that I made a point never to use them again. Alas, my wife, not knowing it was UPS, ordered something for $150 which then came COD for $42.25 for ""brokerage fees and duty"". Ok, excessive, but I paid it. We returned the item to exchange it for something of exactly the same value and UPS charged another $42.25. I called to explain we'd already paid at least the duty and we told the shipper to clearly mark that it was an exchange and so had a net value of $0. But UPS said, ""sorry, we can't tell you what the shipper marked on the package"" (why the hell not?) and that it didn't matter anyway and that we had to pay again or they wouldn't release the package. So, $80.50 fees on $150 item. I've told my wife to never, ever, use UPS again and I'd give the same advice to anyone else thinking about ordering anything online. And, as I said, not the first issue I've had with them, only the last in a long string...."
"For the last few months, my UPS deliveries are scheduled late in the evening (8pm) and either don’t get delivered or are rescheduled for the next day. But even when rescheduled, I’m waiting till late in the day for delivery. While the senders claim 2 day delivery, it never happens. I never thought I’d say this, but I’m going with USPS or FedEx when I have a choice."
"Absolute garbage service
Nobody will help you when u need call in an its 2 days at 6 hrs on hold"
"Yet another delivery “re-scheduled” so far 48 hours beyond the promised time. Unfortunately we, the recipients, have little chance to persuade the shipping companies to NOT use them as they keep offering incentives. Speaking to the customer service they just read a script saying “it will be delivered by xx time” it never is! Fraud, lies and broken contracts with the shippers"
"BLOODY JOKE! NOT A COMPANY! DO NOT USE THEM!!! I left some stuff by accident in hotel in spain and created a pick up OVER A MONTH AGO there to be sent to switzerland. The guy did come the first time but seems some papers were missing... I re-scheduled a pick up date 3 times!!! NO ONE EVER CAME AGAIN! I CALLED, they said its picked up or that pick up and evliery is same address... but I have all emails with confirmation of correct address and scheduled pick up time. I also NEVER received any updates that someone came... etc... customer service just writes me some stupid nice emails not properly answering my question or scheduling pick up. HORROR, USELESS! DO NOT USE THEM. I def. will get my money back as paid with cc... reporting this as freud to my bank!"
"the package was shipped on the 9th and I paid for express shipping and here it is the 21st and I still have not received the package. When I try to track it, it says on the way every day but does not say any more info."
"Never again ups. Ugly over import charges with UPS WORLDWIDE EXPEDITED. On top of the prepaid shipping charge, they charged me $34.51 for ""import charges"" for a little item of $50 value. While its say no charge on ups site and canada custom as well."
"I ordered an item on a Thursday for next-day delivery. The tracking said that UPS had tried to deliver the item twice (Monday and Tuesday) yet no missed delivery tickets were at the address.
The tracking then said that I had selected for it to be sent to the local drop-off point, which I had not and it took over 48hrs to get to the drop-off point. It took over 1 week for me not to receive the item. The vendor then sent a replacement parcel next day via royal mail and it was with me by 9am the next day"
"Order an iPhone 14 pro max and was stolen by the Delivery driver. My address was suddenly removed from UPS website and didn't allow me to file a claim to get my package. I've lost 1,300.00. My package needs ID and signature to receive it...It's not possible for someone else to have my address, my picture ID, and signature."
"This should be a negative 10. For the 2nd time, UPS delivered a meat order that they had left unrefrigerated over the weekend. $90 worth of rotten chicken, pork and beef. I know they had to have smelled it and seen the chicken juice leaking from the box, and still left it on my porch for me to dispose of. Yes, I got a refund. BUT the reason I ordered when I did was because everything I wanted was actually in stock. Otherwise I would have to wait on certain items and then order a $35 minimum . Did I mention I had to dispose of all the rotten meat? I'm afraid to place another order for fear of the same thing happening again, so UPS probably caused WildFork Foods to lose another customer. Yes, I say another because I'm certain I'm not the only one."
Couldn’t receive package due to everyone in the house being at work and I could not depend customer service to change delivery times when everyone is actually home.
Driver left a note that he knocked before not leaving the package. That was a lie. He never knocked.
This company is a f*ckin joke! They attempted to deliver a package while I was at work. I tried to change the delivery method online and it would not let me. I called customer care and she was reading from a script and would not even let me speak! Now they are charging me $8 to go and pick my package up because I will not be home whenever they deliver it since I work! Talk about inconvenience! She kept reading the same lines over and over again while I was trying to figure out what to do about my package. Sickening!
The delivery date has changed five times in three days. Just give me an accurate delivery date and stick to it.
They are not user friendly if you are trying to track a package. Fedex and the post office are far superior in my humble opinion. I hate buying from companies that use ups for this reason.
The system won’t allow me to give 1/2 a star - but I guess 1 vs 5 says it all - I have had many bad experiences with those vendors using UPS - even locally it takes for packages to be delivered in two days - and the times they provide are never correct - a delivery time of 19:00 really means 20:00 or 21:00 if you are lucky - if not it will be the next day or the day after next - the information you get from their customer service reps is contradicting - and the fact that you cannot call a customer service center just baffles me - I had set up pick up at a customer center and was advised someone from that center would call me to let ms know package was ready for pick- well that never happened - so I tried to reroute package to the original delivery address - the ups rep said we had sent a message and asked for the package rerouting tomorrow you will see the update that the package will be delivered- no system update and when I called for the 5th time they tell me the customer center reps declined the delivery to the original delivery address and that package had to be picked up - so there is zero customer service resolution. Btw they charged me $7.50 to hold the package at the customer center - not sure how that works but I feel I’m saving them time and gas to deliver at my original destination- so why do I have to pay them just to hold a package.
"This company is infamous. On August 23, I went to pick up a package from the United Kingdom, containing photos, at a Mail Boxes office in Santiago de Compostela. It was a prepaid package. They asked me 32.93 euros for customs expenses. I hadn't heard of it even when Monsieur Trogneux's husband blocked the Channel. According to the Mail Boxes employee, it was claimed by DHL. It was impossible to tell if the package was being shipped by DHL or UPS. Despite everything, because of the sentimental value of the photos, I paid for it. Days later, I received an invoice from UPS Spain, dated August 7, declaring the amount of 32.94 euros pending payment. Today I just received another invoice from UPS Spain dated September 13 for 2.65 euros for ""Delayed payment (out of VAT range)"". The UPS customer service office tells me that due to the current circumstances, they only work from 9:00 to 12:00. Of course, I do not intend to pay that amount. Please, do not contract the services of UPS."
UPS loves unloading packages at the entrance of driveway or at homes that have no resistance! So lazy
"I now have 2 different packages that UPS just won’t deliver. They apparently tried to deliver one a few days ago, but it says they need to get the code to have access to my building. This is not a new system, that’s always been the case and every delivery person has had the code to get in forever. Now my packages just say they will be delivered at some point, but there’s no actual update. Every day I check and every day it’s the same. This first package was supposed to be delivered 5 days ago. UPS is worthless now, it’s time for them to go out of business entirely if they’re this inept."
"👎👎 I purchased an auto part and was shipped with UPS service on Sep 14th. The only information it provides is package dropped off and nothing after that, and today is September 20th. Denver to Des Moines Iowa that big of a problem. Anyway, I understant they busy, but update the freaking proces so your customers can have an idea where the package is or when it will arrive approximately. It shows on the website, the package should have been delivered 3 days ago, but again there is no information whatsoever. Can't email anyone except you sign up creating an account with all my personal info, which I shouldn't have to do in order to track a package with a tracking number. No one ever answers any calls, so customers are pretty much scammed with the service. Like I said, worst service ever. On top of all this, they don't give a damn about anything. 👎👎"
"I had horrible experience with UPS and I'm still having it... Avoid them, there is no service from them given. THEY NEVER DELIVER THE PARCELS.

I bough some clothing online the the parcel was sent trough UPS. They say was delivering on friday between 11:15 - 15:15... At 12 more or less it was a message on the taking details saying no access to the premises due to a missing code, like I'm living in private area... there is a bus stop just in front of my door, just one day before I've got an argos delivery, I'm getting deliveries from different delivery companies and no problem. Also there are passing luton vans and lorries passing by all day long... But the are not able to complete the delivery. At the end after one week calling them and making complaints I had to go from Acton to Kentish town to pick it up myself to the depot...

Now second round coming and seams the same problem... I had to get it delivery on friday last week and again same problem. But now I'm not able to go an pick it up myself and as is a heavy parcel, and I do not have car to go and pick it up myself. I don't know what do I'm going to do, as call them it does not change anything, is just a big waste of time and nerves.

If you don't get your mental health down trying to get your parcel delivered, avoid this company under any circumstances. I couldn't as was the seller who was choosing the delivery company, but I defenetly will contact those two sellers they sent me the parcel through UPS to let them know how is the no service they are not providing."
Don't use UPS! It's a nightmare. Ordered something. Never got my package. Returned to sender which is in New York. It's been sitting in Kansas for days? Tried customer service. What a joke! They basically did not accommodate my requests and said the driver's gonna do what they want. It's cool you guys get to wear shorts but do try to deliver as you are paid to do! Fed Ex please!
Wish I could give them negative review. As per their website the parcel was expected to arrive on 20 September. Now when I check the date has been changed to 3 October.
"One star is alot for ups they don't deserve that one star I will give them -100 start the wors delivery system in the planet they should never be on market at all. The system tells me they will deliver from 1 pm to 430pm they dont even come close to my building. There's no attempt and they send email saying oh we missed u. How did u missed it when u didn't even deliver it. We try next time second attempt same thing again. What is this joke, just close that stupid office when u can't provide service. Ups is teribile."
Worst company in existence says Address Information Required when i use the same address for all my shipments not once but 10 times same message Address Information Required must be lazy ass people working there
"They lost a package with rare books by Jane Austen, let's hope I get a refund."
"Literally the worst... they sent me an email updating the delivery date for THE PREVIOUS DAY! How does a system allow for that? Attempted delivery while i was away, my house-sitter said ""he'll be back in 4 days, so come back friday"" - when does he return, the very next day. Website? Total con... tracking doesn't update, asks for feedback but only the 'no' button functions. UPS is utterly incompetent, and it makes EVERY VENDOR look careless... STOP SHIPPING WITH UPS."
"I have been waiting for a parcel since sept 16 2022. First delivery attempt we were not home notice said we owe shipping and Duty!!! However we don’t I prepaid online have a printout of paid in full!! Second attempt sept 17 again not home as they said it would be after 1pm in which I was home but said I owed a COD! Again their communication didn’t get to driver… I have called head office 4times all documented! They Promised me again sept 19 now on 3rd day I would get parcel!! Did leave my house once today!! UPS NEVER SHOWED!! I called head office only to get a SORRY!! I guess I’ll have to submit a claim online!!! I highly recommend to NEVER USE UPS , have not heard a good thing about them only horrible service!!
Also the two attempts on delivery indicates I owe a COD CHARGE BUT THE AMOUNT DOESNT MATCH WHAT I PAID IN ADVANCE!!! Brutal"
Because I don’t like being lied to. Tells me my package will be here on Saturday around 7pm doesn’t show then updates and says Tuesday by 7pm. It’s kinda sad that you lie to customers daily and aren’t held responsible when we pay for it.
"I live in Mesquite Nevada. UPS from Las Vegas, has delivered several packages to the wrong address here in Mesquite and they delivered one of my packages to the same address in Las Vegas, 100 miles away from my home. UPS has delivered 2 broken toilets so far. I have been waiting now for 2 months for a new one, it arrived today broken but the driver didn't have time to argue with me he says I will say that you refused the delivery. Now, another try with customer service to deliver yet another unbroken toilet. The employee would not take ownership of the broken toilet and said that he did not break it.it doesn't matter who broke it the fact still remains that UPS has delivered 2 destroyed parcels. Hire some smart caring personnel. One more thing. Amazon needs to quit using UPS . They just don't care."
"Waiting for a parcel that requires a signature? UPS will just mark you as not home even if there are multiple people there and leave your package at a distant access point without bothering to make another attempt.

Other times they will mis-deliver the parcel to your neighbor. Want to try fixing either issue? Good luck, their website is glich galore."
The worst courier service company ever. My package was signature required and the delivery person just left the package without coming to my door or taking my signature.
Horrible service said they were going to deliver my package on the 16 didn't same thing on the 17th didn't so I called them on sunday they told me they are going to deliver it on Monday and still no update on the tracker don't use ups they delay your package for no reason this is the third day that I've been told its coming and I'm wasting my time and others to wait so I can sign for the package and yet they never come honeslty dispointing use FedEx or Amazon they actually do their job
"One star is too much. Of all the times they have been responsible for the delivery they haven’t nailed it once, not even close. I doubt that they even try… n company should use their service. Complete waste of money."
"They clearly let you know who is paying them. The sender, not the receiver. So, delivery really isn't much of a priority for them. As long as the package somehow does (or does not) get to the receiver, works for them. So be prepared to pick up your package from some drop-off point miles and miles away after the driver ""attempted"" delivery."
"I am a Ukrainian currently living in Germany, so I've never had the displeasure to use UPS until a few months ago. So far, each of the three separate experiences have been vexing, to say the least -- just like my foreigner friends have always described them. Unfortunately, I had no choice, and UPS was forced upon me as a delivery agent.

So far, 3 out of 3: they are always late; they do not follow instructions; there's no customer support. Most recent fiasco, a story as old as time -- they ""attempted delivery"" and failed, allegedly, because I was ""unavailable"", despite me lying in wait at home all day long, waiting for it. No doorbell rang. No notifications arrived. No InfoNotice was left in the mailbox. NOTHING.
Now I have to head over to the drop point and somehow carry a 15 kg parcel home by myself.

Thanks, UPS."
"Do not use UPS Norge.
They are the most unreliable and kniving company you can possibly find in Norway.
The amount of aggravation they have caused over the years is not to be believed."
If I could give UPS a minus review I would they are the absolute worst shipping company. How they are still in business is beyond me. Me recommendation would be to never use them. They have no customer service!!
UPS is terrible the service is bad and they never ship my stuff on time this is the 3 time I ordered shoes through Goat and ups has been late shipping my package and when I ask where my package is through customer service they never have a answer.
"I got a notice at my door yesterday(Friday, Sep16) saying: we missed you. Ok, now I’m looking at the pick up location to see which UPS store can I go to pick up my package which is very important for me. NO LOCATION. Ok, now On Saturday, Sep 17 I’m trying to track my package online, and it is saying: second attempt today at 11:48am we missed you again. What the heck?!!!!!! I’m home all day today, and NO any second notice at my door! Why you are lying?? I’m calling UPS to talk to a representative(after having a hard time to connect myself to a live person, finally someone answers me( now, is 12 noon)saying: oh sorry for that. Someone will call you around 1:12 pm, and your package will deliver after that. Ok. I’m waiting till 2:40pm no one called me yet. I’m calling UPS again talking to another representative. He is listening to all that happened and saying: oh sorry for that. Someone will call you soon, and your package will deliver to you today. Don’t worry.
Now it is Sunday 1am and NO ONE did call me. NO PACKAGE has been delivered to me. NO UPS LOCATION I know to go and pick up my package! Stop lying to people. Do your job. You are getting paid for that."
"Well I can understand all the bad reviews now. There should be something in there online app to give you the option to have them leave it at the door. I requested a second delivery attempt online. Most people are working during the day just like they are. It says we'll deliver next day, of course it's Friday never showed up. Hopefully it will show up Monday? When you need something for business it's nice to get it. Says it will be at the drop off location down the road they didn't have it? So it's apparently still on the truck, or at their house? I have security camera. So I'm able to come home to get my package. I'd rather it just be left at the door, then deal with delayment. Even wrote on the back of the sticky note to leave at the door, but they never showed up Friday?"
"I am so tired of UPS sending me messages stating my package will be delivered on such and such a date and then on that date saying ""Oh by the way, we're not gonna get to your delivery today"". If you can't fulfill your commitment, then don't send me messages! A terrible, overpriced, unreliable company"
"Once again, delivery time of 2 to 6 pm today. It's now 6:37 pm. Next time that I check track my package it will say new delivery day will now be Monday. How is UPS still in business??? Next time I buy online I will buy from somebody else if my only choice is UPS for shipping."
"Why is there not a zero rating, I was expecting a package from a seller when I found out it was UPS I was in a panic. they don’t deserve nothing, disrespectful of persons and property. UPS was supposed to delivered my package on 9/16. Delayed, they changed the date to 9/17 the driver gets here and don’t ring the door bell he knocks on my glass, my home is not small that’s why I have a door bell. You contact customer service I spoke to Miguel the supervisor no respect, no apology. He was happy to say there was nothing he can do. What type of customer service is this? Tried to make a complaint and they tell you hold for eleven minutes, more like zero hours. SMH This company should have been out of business along time ago!!!! I don’t even want the package no more :("
"I hate that this is basically the only company we have to choose from. They are completely dishonest, they rip you off. They damage packages and they charge you an extra $1,000 because the package is so warped it changes the dimensions. Then blame you for their handling of the packages. It’s always your fault and they charge you 10x the amount. If this company went out of business I would laugh my *as off. If you want to get f***** then go with UPS. Horrible company. They lost a $600 package to a customer, just lost it. I get a refund of $100 and have to send another $600 package. So their F up costs me 1200 and they have $100 insurance. Absolutely pathetic.

Btw a UPS employee told me not to put “fragile” on any packages because the employees deliberately target those packages and damage them. What kind of l sh** is this? We pay you for this? F UPS"
"Please don't ignore all the negative reviews, this is just a horrible company who refuses to deal with internal THEFT in their company."
"Ups delivery service came through. Driver knocked like 2 yr old child claim delivery attempted. Camera shows entire incident on both days. Delivery said 12noon delivery waited all morning nothing then email with attempt made. Called and promised call back.... nothing again. I'm sure they get it right some time but when it's wrong it sucks!!

Update driver came back with my package. He only has 11to wait for a answer. I have Cancer and can't make it to the door fast most days. That needs to be changed so people can get what they ordered. At least 20 seconds to answer"
"Once again UPS claims my address is incorrect when they have been delivering here for 50 years. New UPS drivers are assigned to routes they are totally unfamiliar with. This happens over and over and over all year long. Calls to UPS result in promises the Watertown NY UPS will call me and they NEVER, REPEAT NEVER EVER call. Is it any wonder that UPS is in dire straits."
Guys avoid this company for anything you send or receive. I can post my exp but that will be long horrifying story where i lost something which was beyond money. Use any one room courier company rather than using UPS.
"Awful service and tracking. You will be waiting all day for a package and then around the end of the delivery time you will get a message saying it will be delivered the NEXT DAY. Very bad service, things don't come on time and you waste your day waiting!"
"Negative stars. They repeatedly didn’t deliver claiming “address problem.” There is no address problem, the UPS truck was in neighborhood and still didn’t deliver. I called customer service and they said at holding center and they would send a message to deliver. Instead of delivering they claimed package lost and then claimed sent back to sender. What a waste of time and resources. I will never use ups again. Just lazy."
"I have been waiting all week for this one package. I had a package release form and everything on my door in case they came while I was work. But that didn’t matter. They were 2 hours late from the time posted anyways so I just took it down and was just going to greet them at the door! However, 30 minutes later I get a notification saying an attempt was made and I was confused because I didn’t hear no doorbell. No knock. Nothing. This guy literally walked up just to put a sticker on my door. It’s IPhone launch day as well which is what I was waiting for and part of me feels like maybe he did it on purpose. It’s not hard to figure out what is in the box especially in today so maybe I am just jumping to conclusions but I wouldn’t hold it against them. But now, I have to wait until MONDAY now…and yeah at the end of the day it is just a package like ok I will survive. But this package has been my silver lining to just a god forsaken week that made everything I went through worth it. Turns out that isn’t the case now! :)"
Signed up for delivery alerts/updates never got them. Wasted an entire friday waiting and when i did pop out of the house for literally 15 minutes of course they showed up and left a sticker saying i could pick up my package at the drop off center which is exactly where i am now wondering where the F my $600 package is!
Delivery driver didn’t go to the right building when dropping off a package that needed to be signed for and said that the person was not home at the time of delivery. So now I have to wait another 3 days to get my package because he couldn’t seem to do his job right.
"So the delivery man never showed up to my residence, so I called customer service to request pick up (same day) she told me it was fine. So I drive 30 minutes to go pick up my package… and wait 10 minutes for employee to come back empty handed. “The truck is empty so you will have to wait Monday for delivery” when clearly they have my package with them… so I told them it was fine that I would wait for delivery.. and an hour later.. I get an email saying that holding request has been accepted… So now I have to go get the package.. WHAT A MESS!


Appart from them being kind…. don’t use if you don’t have patience"
"Received a notification at the end of the day that ""an attempt was made to deliver your package"" and that it's now being rescheduled. There was no attempt made. This company is run by con-artists and scammers from top to bottom."
Literally the worst delivery service. UPS person came to my house to deliver the package at 2:00 but it needed a signature. Why would an adult be at home at 2:00 on a weekday? Of course no one was home so they kept the package. They are not going to try and deliver it again until FOUR DAYS LATER. I’ve already been waiting for a week and now the package is just sitting around somewhere at a UPS warehouse a few miles away. I was thinking that I could just go pick it up myself so that I didn’t have to wait. Not only does it literally cost 12+ dollars to pick it up MYSELF I wouldn’t even be able to pick it up until FOUR DAYS LATER. I know that my package is literally just sitting around somewhere so why can’t I get it. I could just go find the truck thats driving around with it jesus christ. This is so complicated for no reason it should be that difficult. UPS sucks🤮
3th day they pass by my house and don’t get off to deliver my package they skip houses and say sorry we missed you. And then it says they will leave it in a nearby ups local place and I go and they tell me the ups guy don’t stop to deliver packages some times. The ups guy is on drugs and don’t deliver bad service I pay extra for this bs service!!!
This is not the first time.They can never get deliveries right. I ordered an item from target which took 2 weeks to get and ups was to deliver. Delivery day came they gave me a time window between 12-4 it was 6 when I rechecked tracking mind u the package was out for delivery. 10pm nothing tracking goes back to we will notify you of delivery. Next morning tracking shows up being sent back to sender because receiver refused package… they never came to the door my door was open all day and I was home. I have proof the ring never showed them even driving down my street. I called ups and they were gonna redirect the package back too me but 30mins later I get a call that the package was destroyed in the system you mean the driver destroyed it on the truck before delivering it and then writes down I refused the package.. WTH!! Fine if I could replace it. But replacing it is not an option they are sold out.. how about be more careful. They should have used FedEx it would have come in one piece.
"Could give 0 star. Worst service. Delivered my package to other address and can’t get it back. Told me to call claim, claim department told me can do nothing to help with claim. Employees are useless."
"This is the WORST COMPANY EVERRRR. The delivery guy keeps cancelling my order because i am not at the address, which was not true at any time. So they sent back my package because he is lazy to ring the bell......"
"Please don’t use UPS,lousy service,inexperienced and waste of time and money.parcel send for a wedding on the 29/08/22 ,wedding on the 10/09/22 yet to receive.Today 16/09/22 delivery date by UPS 23/09/22.Stay away from UPS"
"As a past employee I feel like I have a unique perspective on this subject and would like to contribute so here goes. The first thing it’s important to address is that this company could not care less about you. I’m not saying that in the normal “I couldn’t care less” saying kind of way, they legitimately wouldn’t flinch if you died receiving one of their packages.

For clarity I used to work there. They know that workers are unionized and do whatever they can to operate on the edges of that. Have specific days you need off for a funeral? Jokes on you! Enjoy using sick time and then getting a company disciplinary meeting for using less than your allotted sick days. They will literally punish you for utilizing the very basics of your union contract. But anyways I’m getting distracted by talking about their operations in a country with labor laws, let’s chat about the help lines. These lines are outsourced mostly to women in hot, crowded, loud spaces, mostly in India and Pakistan, who are forced to pretend they are American customer service reps. They also have a script. If you call asking about a package you’re expecting that day they’re trained to GUARANTEE that package will be delivered. If it’s not? Who cares? Some other under paid lady gets screamed at, not anyone “important.” These poor women and probably men are getting verbally abused for cents on the dollar. Not only that but most often these poor people sound so tired and broken you. Know this isn’t the first time they’ve had this EXACT call. It’s so sad.

Now let’s talk about what happens when you make that call. The majority of the work done for UPS happens from 3am till around 11am. These employees, known as the “sunset” shift are the lifeblood of UPS and most often the people who are in their first 2-5 years with the company. Once that call is placed the customer service rep record it and passes the details on. Those details go to a higher up in the US. That person relays those details to a “coordinator.” Coordinators are non unionized people who for some reason oversee the operation of unionized workers. They are spiteful , mean and angry because they don’t get the perks. They pass the info to a supervisor the last person on the chain of non union people and those people then punish the workers for circumstances beyond their control. All because UPS loves to lie and make promises they can’t keep.

This company is a joke and violates work laws daily. If you have a choice, avoid them."
"Received a notice on my door that UPS had a package that they tried to deliver (but I was home all day and the doorbell never rang) and they would leave it at a local UPS location. I tried to get them to redeliver to my home address (delivery change) via online redelivery. the site stated ""in progress"" .. The next day there was no home delivery. I called that evening and there was no phone assistance, just ""go online"" which again stated ""in progress."" The next day, I called and again no phone assistance and you must go online , and again stated ""in progress"". The next day, I finally went to the local store and there it was, and I was told that the package was there for days and the employee was wondering when I was going to pick it up. I was basically told ""oh well"" at the UPS store when I said that the service was not good and that I had to take time off work to go pick up the package because no info was given over the phone or online when attempting a home address delivery. Noone can be reached; noone cares; TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! WILL NOT USE UPS IN THE FUTURE IF POSSIBLE. Paid to receive DELIVERY, not a pickup, AND COULD NOT GET DELIVERY."
My previous high regard for UPS was ruined today. I sent a return to Amazon using a UPS drop box on 9/12/22. Tracking was not established by 9/15/22 and when I called to check on this the UPS agent said it might be lost but UPS would not investigate...it was up to me to report it to Amazon. Strange and careless disregard for lost package. I will never trust UPS again. Always get a receipt for anything you give to UPS and hope they do not lose your item.
"My experience with UPS has been absolute trash. My package is delayed and I've had to chase down updates with them. They are unable to track their Drivers which is an issue in itself and fail to provide piece of mind to their paying customers. This is literally the worse delivery service out there. If I have an option, I will ALWAYS use their competitors. This company sucks at what they do. That's why you can find endless videos of their Drivers kicking around packages online. I am sure they are using a 3rd party Carrier which is why the service is so poor and likely the reason they do not live track them. I've spent years in Home Delivery amd am shocked that a company this large would be so inadequate. This company is TRASH!"
"The UPS needs to choose better delivery men. One of my packages was ""delivered"" yesterday, but truly I never received. Today I arrived home and I saw this UPS delivery man leaving the packages unguarded outside my building while he was delivering to another building. He left a package between the out doors of my building to avoid the doors closing. I had to open to enter, and the package fell on the floor... What if it have been something fragile?"
"For anyone in the Seattle area looking for a great team to work with, I suggest UPS in Edmonds, WA. The manager Laura and her team were awesome. I did a freight shipment that included more than 50 boxes. Musical instruments were included in the shipment. Upon departure from the West coast and
arrival to the East coast, NOT ONE box was damaged! I was amazed at how they managed to ship all those boxes in the order they did. It was like a Tetris. I was amazed. I never realized the calculations it took to ship things so perfectly. Kudos to Laura the manager and everyone involved. If you live in the area, Please use the services in Edmonds WA on Edmonds Way. Should you need to ship large quantities you will not be disappointed. Thanks so much Team Edmonds!"
"Today UPS came back to us to take back the package they delivered few days ago, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with a different name label that was already crossed off and our name label - correct one is there clearly visible with different tracking number and we have a confirmation that it was delivered. So no, I can’t give you package back. Deal with Costco if you need to. But in this case we ordered the right item and right model and company. So don’t try to mess with us - especially that UPS guy’s boss, she started yelling at us over the phone (delivery guy had called her and placed her on speaker) that she will call security and all - hello? I am a customer, I ordered it from Costco and they are using your service to deliver, if you make a mistake then you have fix it first not threaten customer. What kind of customer service is this?"
My packages never arrive on time yet the tracking on the site shows they are in my city for DAYS. It’s so frustrating and disappointing that this company can’t get it together anymore. What’s worse is that they don’t care.
"9/8/22 there was a delivery attempt. I was home but was in a meeting I could not step away from. UPS left a message on my door with an infoNotice# and 800.833.9943 contact to check on delivery status. Notice and phone automation stated 3 attempt will be made prior to dropping off packages at an access point for pick up. 9/9, was the next scheduled delivery, I waited all day no delivery attempt. 9/12 Monday was the next date referenced, no delivery. On 9/12 phone automation stated dropped off at a Michael’s Art and Craft. 9/13 UPS customer service stated hour for pick up 8-7 PST. I tried to visit site at 8:15 AM and they stated store opens at 9. At noon UPS calls me to confirm if they should pick up and try to redeliver but would not occur until 9/14, so I decided to attempt to pick up myself and be done with this ordeal. Second visit to store location to pick up 9/13, store clerk mentioned UPS just picked up several packages including my package 10 minute before I arrived. Despite me informing UPS do not pick back up I’ll go get it.
9/15 an investigation is launched to locate this priceless package lost and I must wait 15 days for resolution. The driver that picked up the package at the access point for pick up never registered status of the package. Now I have extremely personal private details lost and no package. UPS failed us, very disappointed with their internal miscommunication."
Very fast! The tracking sistem it is so easy to follow. Thank you for give a good service!!
"worst company in the world. and tim in ireland is the biggest moron ever. requested change of address 2 day’s ago, package out being delivered to the wrong address today. incompetent morons. also waiting 6 weeks for them to pick up nespresso pods, keep saying they’ve picked them up. shouldn’t be in business"
"Your driver almost caused a accident today cutting in front of me at the last minute. He became angry because I blew at him so he decided to keep blowing back. They’re always in a rush to get off from work in the afternoon, tell them to slow down and also stop leaving packages at the wrong address because my last package was left at my neighbors house which is empty. Todays incident happened 9/14/22 it will not let me change the date."
"UPS couldn’t find a house in East York!! They tried to deliver to a wrong address, and called me to say there was no one with the right name (at the wrong address). I told them they attempted delivery to the wrong address. They tried it again!!! Not an issue with the shipper giving the wrong address on the package.
No easy way to make a complaint with UPS."
"Dear UPS, out of the last 10 overnight deliveries i paid for, you delivered 1 ontime. This last overnight I requested is only because the vendor didnt offer Fedex. I could have drove from the Canadian border in ND to ohio and back in less time and for virtually the same out of pocket cost. You are making yourself irrelevant. Its just a matter of time until the free market will replace you.....at least that is what I hope. All people want is what you say you offer which is a package within the time frame we pay for."
"If there were a no star that is what they would get. They literally just chucked it on someone else's porch even though my address was clearly marked on the box. I was so lucky the person took time to bring it here. How many people lose all because of them? this not the first time and I have gone to the outlet before to talk to their manager. Clearly they didn't take customer care seriously. At least 3 other times someone that was clearly marked and paid for ""requires customer signature"" was left on the porch or even somewhere else. Are they driving high I have to wonder. re: date of experience I will just use todays."
"The delivery system is disgusting!
They dont even bother themselves to notify us through texts calls emails etc....
This is the most terrible delivery system I have ever had in my entire life!!!"
"The regular UPS driver in our area consistently disregards our address (and directions in address) and leaves our packages in a neighbor's bin (clearly numbered with a different house number) instead of delivering to our house. On the rare chance when they bring the package up the driveway to our house, it is often left on the deck (NOT a main entry) instead of, as requested, at the front door (where said package would be under an eave/ out of bad weather). It is only a couple feet difference for them to walk, but not done. I have lost packages for days (or forever) and had packages ruined because of this."
"They were supposed to deliver a critical medical device on Friday. They said no one home to sign. BS people were home all day. They didn’t deliver Saturday because they said sender didn’t pay shipping. BS called the sender and yes shipment paid. Monday talked to a customer service rep and asked if I could drive to the shipping center, pay shipping if needed and pick it up. He said yes. Drove 20 miles to shipping center and rep said it’s on the truck and there are no charges. Tracking said delivery Monday by 7:00 pm. Come 7:00 pm tracking said delivery on Tuesday by 7:00pm and must be signed for. Tuesday late morning UPS leaves it on the front porch without a signature and didn’t ring the bell. Totally terrible service. This caused great stress for the family. I see why Amazon started their own delivery service and will try to stick with FEDX."
"Worst delivering company. They can't call because drivers don't use phones (!), they don't update where they are, several times I have been home expecting their package but they just say nobody answered the door (perhaps try knocking on the door?).
I would pay 3x more for freight to avoid this company"
The package was broke and the rug was very dirty
"I wonder why they are still around! Very poor customer service period; promised to get a manager to call back but did not honor.

My package is still stuck in transit with a “mechanical failure” for the last 6 days!

My advise to all, DON’T EVER USE THEIR SERVICE!!"
"The deliverer should read an instruction, which is on a customer’s building door. There are bells right at the door with the corresponding numbers, but they didn’t ring them. They’ve just left a note and gone. That’s so negligent."
I don't understand how UPS are still in business. This is the third time IN A ROW that they have have failed to deliver on the date they have stated.
UPS has got to be the worst package delivery service ever. The delivery driver never once knocked on my door and left a invoice for me informing me that it will be sent to a access point next day. The next day is here and now there is a hold on my package and now they are trying to tell me I will have to wait another day in order to get my package and im still in confusion. Please do yourselves a favor and never use ups if you have a choice.
These guys suck. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Nobody wants to help. They can honestly suck multiple cocks. DHGate is better and that’s saying something
"The driver tried once to deliver my package thatrequired a signature, however he didnt even use the doorbell! Then left a sticker that I h ave to come pick it up when the school paid for it to be shippped to me! THEN, you cant even get a representative on the phone to handle it for you. So I will be calling the school back and letting them know ups is ripping them off when they didnt deliver it, I AM NOT going to go pick it up, so it is going to be delivered back to the school then reshipped out again...lol DO YOUR JOB!"
"I have it one star because I had to. This is a small trailer park, our ups driver clearly didn't want to drive through the park so he/she just dropped my $750 package off at the first trailer they came to. With the way people steal packages these days this kind of practice is not acceptable. From now on I will only do business with companies that don't ship by UPS. So disgusted."
"Super fast international delivery, my delivery was collected in London 16.00 and arrived in Altea, Alicante the next day at 12.30, took less than 24hrs, brilliant service, very happy thank you"
"Dreadful. After five days I'm still waiting for my computer to be delivered. The first delivery date was cancelled at the last minute, but not before I had arranged to be at home. It was reschueduled from a Friday to the following Monday. On the Monday it showed as 'Out for delivery' then was returned to the depot for reasons not explained. It was rescheduled for the following day and I'm sat here, like a lemon, waiting for it. Shockingly poor service"
Fantastic company. They deliver beautiful carpets at a very reasonable price.
"Absolutely awful experience. After an 'attempted delivery' of our parcel, no card was left. Without a card, you cannot reschedule the delivery. After calling customer service I was told parcel would be delivered the next day between 9am and 7pm. I waited all day, no parcel. Customer services told me to wait until 8pm. Still no parcel. Another call to customer services - told parcel will be delivered Monday between 10 and 2pm. Still no parcel. The sender then contacted UPS and they have admitted they don't know where the parcel is! Tracking now states parcel is 'delayed'. Absolutely appalling service!"
"If I order online and they UPS I'm going to cancel.

Delayed deliveries
Worse Customer service I've ever had!
They are literally a garbage company

They will go out of business soon"

"Ordered something from Amazon UK and I live in Guernsey, Channel Islands.

But, for some reason, UPS felt that my parcel was in need of a tour of europe sending it from Southampton to Capri……. CAPRI!!!!

Not satisfied with the beauty of Capri, Milan has also featured on my parcels road trip as have places in France.

Not sure if UPS have heard of Google Maps but it is a really cool way to look up address and locations.

So, after nearly 2 weeks of waiting patiently, my parcel is still doing the rounds.

Needless to say, getting hold of a human at UPS to assist is like trying to wrestle a pig in a bath of olive oil (apparently!).

Right, rant over, fingers crossed tomorrow is the day!!! 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻"
"Americans made UPS the top shipper because they were efficient and trustworthy. UPS has outsourced its customer service and now UPS operates on the level of a developing nation, not a first-world country.

What was once an efficient, streamlined first world organization is now akin to mailing packages within a developing nation. Hit or miss. Maybe you get it, maybe you don't. Maybe it arrives intact, maybe it doesn't. Maybe you will get reimbursed for your item if they break it, maybe you won't. Maybe the customer service person in that foreign country will get your information correct, maybe not.

But UPS top-level management continues to ride on the coat tails of a once hard-earned reputation and makes the same money but delivers third-class service. Lucky for them. Too bad for the customers.

In UPS these days it is apparent there is no organization. There is no accountability. It's lazy and poorly run. My personal story is one of many. I paid them to pack and ship my items then it was packed wrong and arrived to the customer smashed. They sent my claim check for reimbursement to the wrong address twice. Who does things like that? Destroying it up from the beginning to the end? Well, if you want inefficiency, use UPS!

This is a company that is willing to sacrifice the reputation it built because Americans trusted them - by outsourcing their entire customer service center to a foreign country. UPS won't hire the same Americans who built their reputation because they are greedy. Yet, they are willing to destroy their reputation for that greed.

I sell and I have told customers that shipping UPS is no longer an available option for them. If I lose their business, it's not worth the headache of having to deal with such an incredibly inept shipping company. I would rather lose sales than have to waste my valuable time where I could be making money cleaning up the messes UPS makes."
"Ups Salesperson Tracy provides the utmost respect and development for sales. Commercial for business success. The team increased sales——- case and point Ups hands down door to door drivers trusted on time
No other than Ups and the staff are very helpful and courteous"
"I been waiting for a package for days and days.
I was emailed 3 different delivery dates.
The 4th was a proof of delivery, 9.9.22
The package was not on our porch.
I cant contact the seller they have no phone number listed on their website.We are out 59.96 with no help."
"I will never use UPS under any circumstances. Their customer service is below zero. The chance you will be talking to person to explain the automated system wouldn’t understand near zero.
I won’t use nor will I recommend anybody or any company to use UPS to deliver any item."
Rarely delivers my packages. Will say no one answered and send it to a parcel station even when I spent all day at home. Now I have to spend 6€ on a bus to go and pick up something that was meant to be delivered to my door
"My delivery has been ""Out for delivery today"" for 5 days. Their customer service is rude and unhelpful. No one at UPS is willing to help find out why they won't deliver my package. There is no way to get a manager or supervisor to work on the problem. All the customer service person does is read the same information that you can get online. They are frustrating and not a customer service oriented company to deal with."
Expecting a government document that requires my identification and signature. Driver signed on my behalf and left package outside the building.
"I still don't have my package!
I ordered my weatsuit 3 weeks ago and UPS doesn't delived my package yet!"
No one is ever available to talk to you when you’re having package issues. You try to tell the phone service your tracking number and it can never understand you. And I’m in a quiet place speaking slow one digit at a time. For some reason they request a address that’s is completely the same as the one I originally had and UPS still can’t deliver to the correct address. Then they send a message stating they alway have issues delivering a package. So they request more money to deliver and still can’t deliver a package right. I confirmed my address twice and insured that I had the right one and apparently there are still problems delivering my package to me. I will never use this service again. It’s good for nothing and you just end up wasting money.
Delivered om time and lovely friendly delivery guy
UPS has gone so far down hill. I recommend anyone who has stock in them to sell. I follow their guidelines of double boxing and packaging and the last two packages arrived at their destinations as if a bunch of teenagers took baseball bats to it. They’ve cost me over $700. Never ever use their service.
"I should have read the reviews for UPS prior to using their overnight courier service. UPS is not a next day courier service. Incompetent and unreliable. I am really disappointed with UPS. I sent a package on Thursday to NY and the package still has not arrived. I would like a total refund.

Please find an alternative courier. I will never use UPS again."
Very bad service no communication at all no calls no updates very hard to get ahold of and when you do get ahold of coustmer service not helpful at all if I can give negative stars I would
"I thought I was going to have to explain how bad UPS was but it seems they have bad reviews all over the place.

I will NEVER, EVER, use UPS again… how tf are they still in business?

P.S. my package was supposed to be delivered at 8:30-12:30 (waited 4 hours outside my apartment). Now, it says “end of day”… still nothing and it’s past 7:00 p.m.

GFY UPS

Sincerely,
Another pissed off customer"
"I am disabled my pharmacy shipped my medication overnight via UPS and UPS lost my medication. My medication is very expensive as I have an auto immune disorder. I am out thousands of dollars, and the pharmacy is blaming UPS and UPS does not get on the phone nor do they answer emails"
"I was supposed to receive a package on Wednesday, September 7. Then I received an email from UPS saying that it would be arriving Thursday, September 8 between 2:30 and 6:30 PM. As my package needs to be signed for, I changed my plans to be home during that period. After nothing arrived, I phoned UPS and got a subsequent email saying that it would be there on Friday, September 9 between 2:30 and 6:30. I received another email in the morning saying that there was an attempt to deliver the package at 09:30 AM but the business was closed and that the package would be delivered on Monday. I was home, but no attempt was made to contact me and then upon phoning UPS again, I was told that there was some confusion this was the wrong package and the wrong address. I was told that a supervisor would phone me back and I never received a call. What inept, disgustingly poor customer service! How can a company stay in business with performance like this"
"Shipping times are *usually* reliable and I have never had a package get lost. However, the system of customs charges is ridiculous. While companies like DHL will inform you of charges prior to delivery, UPS offers no such service unless you sign up ahead of time and link your delivery to a special account, and all my accounts stop working after some time. I have also had numerous instances where the UPS Driver was supposed to attempt a delivery and charge me upon delivery but instead didn't ring the doorbell and lied that they missed me, leaving ""Please Pay Online"" on the UPS InfoNotice. Now I will have to have my package mailed to me after delivery as I am moving out (my fault for the bad timing, sure.) The so-called attempted delivery was a day later than expected regardless.

Is UPS reliable? To an extent, yes. But I would never bank on it."
"I ordered a phone from Costco as I broke mine and couldn't run my small business or work without one. It took 3 days longer then they said it would and then they LOST the package. Luckily Costco sent me a replacement and now they LOST THAT ONE TOO! That's $4k worth of good gone and I've lost 2 weeks of business. Both packages mysteriously went ""missing"" at the Caledon ON location. They are a bunch of CROOKS"
"In June UPS lost a return shipment that was paid in advance. In the ensuing months, ~20 calls, got to humans 5 times, all challenged the evidence that it was shipped, evidence they had from their own they made when it was picked up at a university. The cost to our work and staff - more that we claimed.

Please note, nearly all drivers are superior and local pickup and delivery are reliable. The claims department needs, at least, functional staff that follows up and verifies progress within a reasonable time period"
"I recently ordered something online that was meant to come on the Thursday after I ordered it, so I was tracking the package all day while I wasn't home and it said it would be there by the end of the day. However when I got on the bus to go home I checked one more time and the status had changed from in transit to on the way and saying ""address information required."" I tried to use the AI customer support to see how to fix the address, which is apparently something it can't do and I had to get email UPS support which said I would get a response within day, which meant it wouldn't be able to come the next day seeing as at this point I was almost going to bed. When I woke up I checked my email as well as the order status, and while I had no email the order status no longer said address information required. So pretty much did the same thing as the day before, and not long after I got home I saw a UPS truck across the street so I figured it had my package. I then watched as the truck turned back around and left without giving me my package. I checked the order status again and it was the same message as the day before. I then checked my email (I hadn't before because I assumed the problem was fixed), to see that customer support said to reply to the email with my address so they could correct it. At this point it was too late to get it by today so I guess I'm going to get it tomorrow (hopefully). I just don't understand what the problem is seeing as how they clearly had my address since the truck came right across my house but still said my address was information was wrong. What also made me really upset is that they didn't say anywhere on their website how to remedy this problem, nor was there a place to fix the address. As far as I can tell the only way to fix this is to talk to customer support which is just a pain in the ass to do and so unnecessary."
"Horrible. I was having a package delivered from Texas and was excited to have it on 9/9/22. Never received a text or email stating that hey your address is wrong or incorrect, It simply stated my city where I lived! Now my package is going to me late by a day to 4 days since they have a rule of our drivers only drive the packages once??? Ok simple solution is to have the package dropped off to another diver who will be in the area. I know im a bit stingy about this, but I have been waiting way too long to get this package and for it to be delayed longer is annoying."
Terrible tracking compared to FedEx and terrible customer service if you want the bottom of the barrel to save a couple bucks go with UPS!
"Horrible experience, the AI bot did not work and actually hung up on me at one point after saying I need my tracking number (which I had and tried to give it.) After calling back, I told my tracking number to it 3 times and it couldn't figure it out and would not connect me with a representative. Terrible."
"I am a receiver. Spoke to a terrible customer service rep. UPS makes automated emails on when packages are ""estimated,"" to be delivered. Example. The label gets created by the shipper for 2nd-day air, but the shipper hasn't handed it off to UPS, UPS will still send you an email that states your package will arrive in 2 days. Then they make you sign up for UPS MYChoice or whatever it is to see package details.

When consulting with a customer service rep, they literally just tell you, ""Sorry the shipper hasn't handed it to us."" and then literally hangs up without any rhyme or reason. Absolutely terrible logistics and customer service."
"First bad experience I ever had with this company. We have been using them for 8 years or more, because of one drivers attitude slamming doors and windows and going fast when asked to slow down, then be retained as he played a chicken game with a resident, they will no longer service a whole area, so people are sending their packages back and they are also being told if they want their packages they have to drive 100 miles away. When trying to ask to talk to a person in the corporate office they say they can't give that number out. Ask for legal dept you get the same answer. People are also not being refunded for having to drive to get their packages. So they are basically hurting the seller & buyers. What has happened to this company? Unfortunately they are saying the driver was assaulted because they driver is not being truthful and the police report does not express everything that happened. The corporate could at least listen to what happened and stop punishing people because of their drivers indiscretion."
"I paid for second-day air for this delivery because it was needed urgently. I used the UPS tracking site, which shows very little, just the date to be delivered, and the time, sometime (9:00am to 9:00pm).
When I logged in, it showed it was out for delivery and would arrive on 9/7. When I didn't receive the package, I logged in again, and they changed the delivery date to the next day 9/8. I received a text that the delivery could not be completed because the zip code was wrong and to log in and correct. It was correct, so I called to get answers. I was told to disregard the text, that it was correct, and that I would be receiving the package before Noon. By 5:00 still no package, so called again. I was then told it would be sometime before 11:59 PM. It's 11:00 pm now, still no package. I really doubt they have drivers working until midnight. We are an animal rescue and desperately need these medications."
uPs is the worst transport by far! A overnight delivery took them 5 days and is still not delivered. NEVER I will use this brown shi… ever again. And will also advise my supplier not to ship me anything with this very bad company.
"Waited all day for UPS to deliver item I ordered. I continually checked tracking. Suddenly, UPS reports it was DELIVERED! But I have been waiting all day, and it has not been. I call UPS who only loops recorded messages over and over. Call the vendor - they can't reach UPS either. I scour the neighborhood and find the package a quarter mile from our location by the side of a gravel road. We are a business. We can't use this kind of ""service"". We are going to have to talk to our vendors about switching to Fedex exclusively."
"Worst place to use , you can’t get no we’re with them , Always late . Lost package on there side there fault. Awful"
"Because my parcel needed to be delivered within the next 24 hours, I used the most expensive postal service of UPS. Despite the fact that UPS had confirmed that my shipment would be delivered within the next 24 hours, it was not. Today is Friday, and the procedure will be put off at least until Monday. My passport was in the shipment, and the delay will prevent me from traveling on my next trip. Also, their answering service was terrible. I went through a lot of stress, and it all came down to this.
I would never use UPS again."
"Good timely delivery with a smile.

Unfortunately, the return process is not good. Package was retained at pick up point before return to sender for 14 days despite delivery being rejected by recipient. Refund process of 900€ likely to take one month."
"To say that UPS chose brown as their color is appropriate because the companies customer service is for sh$t.
A computer screens your call and is the most moronic system ever created. No matter what you answer, the standard reply is I still don’t understand. You can say shipping, and the computer still doesn’t understand even though it is being used for a company that does “shipping“. When you finally do reach a real human, they simply ask for information that should already be in the system but they waste your time asking for it all over anyway. Then once they’ve heard your story they will put you on a “brief“ hold which can last for 10–20 minutes, before you get frustrated and hang up since they purposely put you into limbo. The system had the gall to tell me my package was out for delivery while a service rep informed me that there was a delay and it will be delivered the next day. They can take their “system “ and shove it up the CEOs ass !!"
"Customer service is a complete joke. I would give 0 starts to this company if I could. Every time I try to file a damage claim online it gives me an error with no reason why and says to contact their customer service number. I contact the customer service number and it gives me NO options to speak to an agent about filing a claim just says it needs to be filed online. I would do that IF IT WOULD LET ME. Finally after calling their IT support I am able to get transferred to their claims department. I asked the person how I can directly reach their department in case I need to follow up on my case and he said I can only call their customer service number. I truly believe this company PURPOSELY makes it this difficult to file a claim so that they do not have to pay out the damages that they cause.

They also completely repackaged one of our items in a WHOLE NEW BOX and the item was damaged beyond repair inside when the customer opened it. We know that they shipped it in a new carton because the original carton has our company carton markings on it and the shipping box it came in was completely blank. The other package this customer received (she had two) came without the original shipping carton it was shipped in. It was a dining chair, and it was delivered to the customer's doorstep without a carton and the label was slapped DIRECTLY on the chair. And we've had past damage claims that were failed because they said there was no visible damage to the outside of the box so they are not liable. SHADY SHADY SHADY!!"
Absolutely terrible establishment. Had me waste an entire day waiting to sign for a package that never came. Spent money traveling to an access point I never authorized for them to send it to just to get there and my package not be there. Absolutely nobody can tell me anything just it was shipped to the access point. 3k in one package. And nobody absolutely nobody can tell me a thing.
"Ups is trash!! Don't even bother calling them, the stupid idi0ts on the other line won't help you!"
"Arrived at designated UPS pick up site to pick up package scheduled to be delivered today. No tracking, no package except “delivery by 7 PM” so figured was still out on a truck. I changed delivery address to my home address. Site provides no warning but this resulted in package simply being returned to UPS without being delivered. I was charged six dollars to change the delivery to a designated UPS site originally and will now pay another five dollars tomorrow to pick up the package. Not impressed."
"Good collection service, arrives in the timeslot selected except both times the driver arrived a day early?! So I missed him both times yet I have to ring to reschedule!"
"IF I COULD LEAVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD!!! Our company ships medical equipment to elderly patients, so it's super important they receive their devices on time. This is literally the 4th time where I scheduled a pick-up and they don't show up not ONCE, but TWO days in a row. If it didn't take our company almost 3 months to have a completed agreement with them and another 2 months for me to receive my thermal laser printer(it's a loaner so I still technically have not received mine) then I would cancel our accounts. I can't even order more packaging from the website, the entire UPS franchise is a joke.
Our account manager is incompetent, and customer service via online or over the phone is even worse. The driver's, when they do show up, are the best thing you guys have- seriously!!
Well, gotta go and drop 30 packages of medical equipment on my own... again. Thanks for nothing UPS."
"UPS single-handedly has the worst customer service of any company. It is a huge waste of time to even call them on their customer service hotline. They will give you some useless AI to get you want you want, but in reality, it can't even understand what is being told. This AI seems like it is programed to prevent the customer from receiving help.

Even after the excruciating effort to even contact a representative, they fail to even process your problem. We asked multiple times to track a package and we were told to just follow the tracking number and with no information what to do after package was lost.

By the time we discovered the package was lost it was over the 60-day limit to file a claim. We had to figure that ourselves without to no help from customer service at all.

We were sending over phones to Verizon since we were told to by the company when trading it in. We lost 1600 USD to UPS horrendous customer service hotline. All because employees are improperly trained to handle any situation given to them.

We rated this review 5 stars just to raise awareness of this abhorrent company."
"This company failed to deliver an order on time, lied about trying to do so. Then when they were told the order was cancelled by me, by Amazon and by the supplier, they then rang me to ask me about delivery! I told them it was cancelled. Nevertheless, they went ahead and blocked my doorway with it - a heavy item - which now makes it difficult to get in an out of my own flat. Not merely incompetent beyond belief but arguably malicious"
"My delivery has been delayed for almost a week. So far, I am still waiting.... I am totally upset with UPS!"
"I am very disappointed with the service UPS provided during my last shipment. In the past their service was on point. Apparently, this time my package has mysteriously gone missing. I wouldn't have mind so much if this was a regular shipment. However, this shipment was for an occasion on this Saturday. Now on top of working my fingers to the bone for 20 hours I have to give a refund. I actually could have just driven the package myself if I had known all this was gonna happen. The staff showing no compassion is another thing that's bothering me. I was provided a phone number that no one has answered in 3 days. That's called the ""run around"". Thanks UPS!!!! Now let me try to restore my name...smh"
"UPS lost my package. After a lost package and paying for a $100 insurance , I was never able to get someone to really help. They not only lost my belongings but never paid the insurance that I paid for. I trusted UPS but no more."
"Phone call prior to delivery, time and date as stated"
Terrible service - for more than a week I am trying to get a code from them to collect the package from the closed locker. I really hope to get it before my package is sent back to you.
"Unbelievable!
4 out of 4 times that an online shop used UPS to send me a product, the delivery was problematic: delayed 1 or 2 times, no information, wrong notifications, item kept in some warehouse and had to call the customer service at my own expense of time and money.

The reason why UPS is successful is that it's used by companies which have no incentive to make their shipments arrive on time and without hassle.

The customer will never blame the online shop so they're safe and can keep using the cheap services of UPS.

So please, give a bad review to the companies that use UPS and specify that it's their responsiblity to make use of a decent delivery service."
"I wish amazon would stop shipping threw ups, this is my 5th package this year that's been delayed! every package I got threw ups has been days late once again like clockwork package is delayed or we can't locate it. I never got a package threw ups without issues. these guys are the worse if u have any other option to ship do it save yourself the hassle."
"Completely useless tracking system
I cannot reschedule because I have to sign up (again) for UPS and it insists I am in the Unites States but I am in France - Completely unusable website"
"Upon arrival of my order of 190 CHF I was charged over 40 CHF for ""Governmental Taxes""!?
With 7.7% taxes in Switzerland?"
"Placed order with Coach for wristlet on 8/9/22. It made it to Florida on Aug 12 and never had another update. Still hasn’t as of 9/3/22! I emailed UPS on 8/29. In the meantime Coach direct shipped a replacement on this date, according to UPS, it was delivered on 9/2 at my door. It was not there! (I have lived at this rural address away from the main road, for 22 years and never has a package go missing). I was actually at home at it’s delivery time of 12:24. My dog never barked. He always knows and barks when any car delivers!!!! I’m convinced the package was never even delivered!!!!!. Miraculously after several calls/emails I then started getting notices from UPS/UPS Mail Innovations daily that my original package would arrive by 7PM, so far it’s was have supposed to have arrived four days in a row….it’s September 4th and it’s still not here! I have emailed with NO RESPONSE! UPS and UPS INNOVATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! At least explain what the issue is!!!!!! This is unacceptable! Both deserve -10 STARS!!!!"
"UPS is far the worst service to use to deliver your packages. Two weeks ago I sent a package to myself from my hometown the box came busted wide open..anybody could have stuck their hand in there and took precious belongings from my deceased mother that was precious to me, but thank God they didn't. If I could put a picture of the Box up here I would but it's not allowing me to show you. I was really surprised that no one would even help me or try to file a claim on it nobody could do anything that was the first incident. The second incident is that I ordered something and it was coming UPS (not my choice) but I've gotten three different days that it was supposed to arrive. I waited all day for the package to come and never got any new updated notices that it wouldn't even be delivered. Then when I spoke to someone they said that they don't deliver on Saturday. I'm registered with them and I told him I said you are lying to your customers because it said it delivered on saturday. I got an email and text message but according to their worker that is not true. SO fed up with UPS."
"i cant even put into words how bad their costumer service is. have been waiting for another package for over a month, which they said had been shipped back to china and then blamed the alibaba worker saying they asked for the package to be shipped back. still hasnt arrived. package is now apparently still in country waiting to be picked up from post office. wth"
"Your parcel was delivered to Mvcmsd strre seld
It was also delivered to Caroline Pellat - no address given.
Really pernickety password system and the robot online to nowhere - please repeat all the info you have just submitted 2 mins ago.

Fortunately my underpaid and overwalked postman knew what it meant, as he is a fluent Swahili speaker."
My new boots arrived soaking wet! Not impressed!
"I am registered with UPS app in the app I request if not home leave on porch. Stupid driver comes by, while I'm not there and takes parcel with him. Leaves no note. I go into tracking, it says it is at a access point, nice. Which access point? There are 20 around me. Call customer service, I get the Asian woman can barely understand her, OMG"
"They suck on every level. Ten year olds on bicycles could run a better delivery service than the shitshow UPS. I can't believe that there aren't more delivery options, because UPS would be belly-up in a year with even mildly competent competition."
"Awful service! I waited at home all day for a signature required package since the eta was by 7pm. At 7:10pm I checked tracking since I hadn’t gotten package and it says delivery attempted, delivery now set for 3 days from now (due to holiday). Called customer service who weren’t able to do anything, surprise surprise. I can hear when someone drives into the driveway and I have a dog who barks if someone knocks on the door and I was literally home ALL DAY!"
Employee of the month clearly didn't even try to deliver my package. I was sitting on my couch when I heard my alexa go off claiming that I missed my package right by our front door. If I get the option I'm not choosing UPS ever again...
"Package was not delivered on time and now I’ve missed out on my long weekend plans, thanks UPS.

I was receiving updates from the company that sent the package instead of UPS because UPS’s website would not load my tracking number after continuous attempts on both my phone and computer.

These updates only provided location and did not give me any indication that I needed to be home to sign for the package as that is dictated by UPS. I knew exactly when the package was coming and easily could have been home to receive it (no thanks to UPS), but was left with an “unsuccessful delivery” message when checking after it was supposed to arrive due to not signing for it.

Now the shipping centre is closed for the long weekend and will not even allow me to drive out myself to come collect it and save my weekend.

I had to call several phone numbers before being able to speak to a person that was actually able to provide information.

This is incredibly disappointing service and I will be avoiding UPS in the future."
"Unfortunately, there is no 0 star otherwise 1 star is an extremely high score for them!
I have not seen any worse post company than UPS. They almost never deliver your package on time to the right address. You might collect your parcel somewhere in the city yourself if you are lucky and have the possibility to collect it him/ herself.

Their driver never delivers anything to your home and by default, they report you were not at home. I even tried once to sit beside the window the whole day and I did not see any UPS vehicle near my home and I got the message that I was not home so I always choose an access point when I have no alternative post company to choose and they have delivered the packet to another place another side of the city! I wonder what and how they work really!
And still, they have not moved it back to the access point I chose!"
"UPS = pain in the a$$
I ordered sneakers. The store sent them safely. As a result, on the day of delivery, the delivery man came twice for delivery and twice made sure that “the client had moved”, which is indicated in the tracking. Nobody came. Nobody called. And I paid for shipping. I call customer service and they tell me that I would go to pick up my package myself or pay another $ 11 for delivery. Shameful company with terrible service."
"Made a purchase from Colorado to be sent to Pennsylvania. They sent it to California instead. Delayed my package for a week. Nothing offered to try to rush(express) shipment to Pennsylvania to correct. ""We're so sorry"" means you didn't try."
"Worst parcel carrier ever. Competitors aren’t perfect but are much more reliable. Tracking system sucks. ETA is changing without reason, truck drivers don’t care about their customers. Avoid UPS if your a company. In Canada, I recommend Purolator, GLS or Fedex."
"horrible customer service. Its like talking to a wall. They keep repeating the same things without trying to understand the issue. I had a situation where they were at fault but they never tried to help or rectify the situation. Absolutely a horrible experience, always choose anyone but them when you have a choice."
"Not only have I not received my package, but the customer service rep had the worst attitude and still couldn't help me. I'm just disgusted!!!"
"First the driver ""attempted"" delivery twice, each time someone was home. It's possible no one heard the doorbell, but it seems suspicious. The real customer service nightmare starts from there. First you have to use their Virtual assistant chat bot, that is terrible. That bot suggests you can do a lot once you create your online account, but that was a lie that account provided nothing. Then I had a helpful chat exchange with a real person, but that person couldn't change my delivery options via that channel instead stating I had to call their 800 number. That number starts with an absolutely brutal IVR system/menu. After persevering through the menu and identifying yourself to the IVR the live agent then makes you go through the exact same process. Thankfully your tracking number is a really long string of both letters and numbers so it is super hard to communicate over the phone, especially to agents for whom the American English accent is a challenge. Eventually I got what I wanted, but they charged me $8.00 to pick up my package from their distribution center. I have to pay to pay extra to pick it up from you? All around awful experience. The humans I encountered along the way were all lovely people, it is the system that needs a massive overhaul. IVRs and Virtual Chats are fine, but should not be required to get help."
Their automated phones are the worst I have ever had to work with. If I could use any other carrier I would. I have more confidence in giving my credit information to spam phone calls than UPS correcting their mistakes.
"I called to have a package rescheduled delivery date. The rep told me about an $11.99 additional charge for each package, there are two. When calling back, after confirming the charge would be acceptable, the second rep told me it couldn’t be done there was a restriction. Informed him the package would be setting outside of the office for 4 days because it’s a holiday weekend and no one will be there to accept the package. There was nothing he could do. I would need to call the sender. When leaving a poor survey response and comments the survey was unable to process. So l am leaving my review here."
"Because of UPS flight delays due to mechanical issues, Knowing that if you are kind and respectful you will get some assistance. 3 hours of time spent, talked with 6 reps, hung up on twice. Not a single person could do what FedEX can. And this is not the first time. This company is so big, they really don't care about you or the costly problems they themselves create. And I though USPS was bad..."
Expect a bunch of bs driver comes by puts note on door sorry I missed u car out front doesn't knock ring door bell nothing and off he goes
"UPS Customer service system is honestly designed by illiterate people. They don't link emails, SMS and chat for CS. They pretend to give you a map to see where your delivery truck is, but if you watch it after they say ""arriving soon"" hours go by and you just see the truck bouncing around within a block of you only to be told, ""Oh, it should arrive by 9pm"" Uber can tell you within a minute of arrival, so you can be ready. Many building require you to be buzzed in via the customer's phone number. Somehow, UPS won't bother. Every time you chat, they ask for 4 different replies before chatting, even if you are signed in and a responding directly to a message about your shipment."
"I hate to give them one star!! They do not care about the customer at all!!! I've been given the run around for days! I paid extra to get my package 2nd day for nothing! It's been a week and I still don't have it! The driver has noted that my address is invalid. That's funny cause I'm sitting at that very address right now! I've given directions, I've called, I've spoke with management, to me avail! If I find out a company is using UPS I will cancel my order! I refuse to give them my hard earned money to be treated so poorly!"
"This is the worst shipping company I’ve ever communicated with. If there were more options they’d receive less money from me. Useless customer support, nothing I can do about a seller marking a package as needing a signature, and because I HAVE A FUVKING JOB I can’t sit around my house waiting from 12-4 for my god damn package to arrive. If I request that they leave the package AT A VERIFIED LOCATION, where THEY HAVE TO GET MORE PACKAGE FROM ANYWAYS, they want to charge me a fee, FOR FUVKING WHAT. If you can avoid it, never send or receive anything with this soulless company.

Update. The service rep that answered my call the first delivery day lied to my face about the specifics of delivery instructions regarding requiring a signature. The next day I sat at my house right before I saw the driver entered my neighborhood so I could minimize my time away from work. I’m sitting reading a book, no door knock, no nothing, check driver location and he’s long gone, open my front door and there was my package. Baffled at this, I called this company again for them to tell me that “it was never marked that way, we made an oopsie” once again another worthy note for how trash these people are."
"I will never depend on UPS again for anything that matters. I tried to send time sensitive docs from the US to Canada, $65 for 2 day delivery. It's a week later and my package is still not there!!! To add insult to injury (and their mistakes will cause me financial loss) the customer service is impotent. Their stupid phone system wouldn't give me a human and hung up on me 3 times. The delivery issues I had to find out on my own because UPS took NO initiative or responsibility to let me know they had an issue. They have lost a customer forever."
This will be the last time I use UPS! I’ve paid for a important package to be expedited so I can receive it a approximately 4-5 days. Almost a week later still NO package. I called ups customer service to check on my package. The representative stated my package was lost. So never again will I use this company.
"Worst transport company I’ve dealt ever!!! They didn’t deliver on time even if I paid extra to come faster.
They didn’t even know where the boxes are 10 days after the target delivery date.
They lost 1 box, 2 months after no refund, no update, complete silence.

NOT A COMPANY TO TRUST"
"It told me, that my order would be delivered on the first day on their website and I was surprised because I´ve heard plenty of negative reports regarding UPS. Guess what... No package delivered that day and it says there is a problem with the delivery the morning after. Now I have to wait for a new date of delivery, although it should´ve arrived already."
"So after waiting for more than a month, my package is being sent to the sender. All those moments that they say were in my door, I was home and they never rang the doorbell nor did they leave a paper saying they tried. So tnx a lot UPS, I see why they have a bad rating here."
"what a joke this company is!? they wrote that I would receive my item between 09.15-13.15,.. the time is now 11.08 and I just received an email that they have changed it to 12.00-16.00 .... they could just as well have written stay at home all day!! what a garbage service from this company."
"I have a small ranch, and the gate to it is a good half mile from my house. I have a sign on that gate that says ""UPS drivers- DO NOT LEAVE PACKAGES HERE!"" I put that sign up because packages left there kept getting stolen. When I called to complain, the supervisor said they were left there because the gate was closed. It wasn't locked. Just closed. Apparently if you are expecting a package, they expect you to go out and hold gates open for them to drive through whenever they happen to arrive. I even put in a drop box at the end of my driveway for them to leave packages in. Instead, they leave it under the sign that says not to leave packages there and gives two phone numbers to call if they need someone to come out and meet them. The supervisor said too bad.... that was the way it was going to be."
"I literally do not understand how they are still in business and why they are allowed to operate.

The drivers are the laziest and take no pride in getting the shipments to the customers on time.

I paid for the highest 1 day shipping. For 2 days, the driver ""attempts"" delivery. They say they don't have the buzzer code, yet you can simply walk in and drop off my package to the concierge? And yes, I paid the import taxes well in advance cause I know they try to use that as an excuse as well.

Then proceeds to tell me it takes 2 business days to let a driver know the buzzer code?

Not only this, but it's damn near impossible to get anyone competent on the phone. They try to give you zero options, and in the end....I have to go pick this up myself.

Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with."
"I always use our local UPS store in Hernando Florida in Citrus Hills. My go to person is Gino Riccio, he always greets you with a smile, is so helpful & friendly. A great asset to your organization."
"One of the worst delivery company ever.
Never could deliver parcels on time. Always there mistakes. I have never chosen UPS by myself, in case I buy something and the website chooses UPS it happens 10000000 problems.

It is a shame!"
They suck! Incompetent workers- I always have to call them because they “claim” my address is incorrect when it’s not. As of now I’ve been waiting for my delivery since 8.24.22 it’s 8.31.22 n I have yet to receive it. Best believe in the future I will avoid using and/or having my delivery sent through them. I’m sticking to FedEx-USPS-Amazon
"Terrible service with hidden fees

I don't know how this company is still in business, it charges multiple layers of hidden fees. when you challenge the fees they respond with the most annoying line ""you still owe x amount"" they do not even acknowledge your email. when trying to talk to a manger they just put you on hold indefinitely. Absolute snakes, they should be shut down.

If you have the choice go DHL or Fedex. trust me you will regret using UPS."
"The customer service is unhelpful and mean! I got a panic attack talking to them on the phone. Someone rescheduled my delivery date even thought I did not request it. Then the driver came 3 times and said that I am not at home when I was waiting for him all week at home. He did not even try calling me because apparently they dont have a professional phone. How is it even possible ? Anyway, I spent my days calling UPS like 4-5 times per day because they would promise to call me back reassuring that they will deliver it today. But it did not happen. Then they always have bugs on the website for my status and they never communicate on the website when the package will arrive. Nightmare ! Company that does not know how to solve problems — both the driver and call center. I will never use this delivery service for my own brand and for anything else. I have been still waiting for my package."
"Utterly hopeless and unreliable. Unfortunately, I didn't check these reviews prior to agreeing to have a gift sent from the USA to a friend in Spain. Alarms should have rung when their depot said no such address existed - which was odd as I'd visited and stayed with my friend only a matter of months previously, and used Interflora on many occasions to deliver flowers - which were delivered on time without any difficulty. After sending the company I had ordered the gift from additional details including photos from Google Maps to show UPS that the address did exist and its exact location.... I had hoped there would be no further problems. Stupid of me on reflection!! 3 times they say they have tried to deliver the package - 2 of which my friend and I KNOW she has been home all day!! They are either lying, or trying to deliver to the wrong address. After being told they had failed in their 3rd and final attempt to deliver the item, today I received a UPS tracking message saying that it was ""on its way"" to their local distributor depot for the area my friend stays in. Which is it UPS - you've tried 3 times to deliver it or its just on its way to the local depot?
To conclude, my advice to anyone sending any item is DO NOT USE THIS UTTERLY USELESS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."
Obviously they don't care because they have a horrible overall review rate. I used UPS to package and ship a glass sculpture. It arrived in 8 pieces. I filed a claim and they put in an order to pick it up for inspection and now it seems to be lost. Every other day I have a ups guy stopping by with a pick up order and I gave it to the first guy 2 weeks ago. It was a one of a kind statue that cost me almost $200 to ship. I think they lost it in purpose so they don't have to pay the extra insurance I took out.
"I ordered a package from UPS, delivery date today between 12-4, and when it did not arrive I messaged. Completely gave me the run around and insisted it was the shipping company it came from. They're two hours from my home address, it's medicine for my body pain and anxiety. Couldn't connect to a representative, every facet was automated but messenger, and they told me to call resellers, who confirmed they picked it up by order number. Gave me the run around so much I got so exhausted. Blaming another company when they have records is dishonesty at least, a lie at best and slander of another company. I sent screenshots of the label and order arrival date today, and got given the absolute run around.

PS my mom worked there and told me the workers are spiteful. They'll step on items, toss them, etc if they get aggravated in the slightest.

I do not recommend them. Highly unreliable while blaming another company with a record of it being picked up."
"Keep getting a package that's now costed me in total $100 or more to keep getting.
If it gets lost again im calling the authorities. At this point im postive a worker is stealing the same package over and over again. This will not be tolerated."
"A warning to the insurers that insure UPS deliveries and businesses that use UPS. The drivers consistently commit fraud by using an employees name as the person who received the package without them ever receiving it. Even if the package ""requires signature"" they lie and don't actually get one. UPS is aware of this practice and does not care."
"UPS have had a package I rejected for over 8 weeks now.

Instead of returning to sender as they said they would. They continue to attempt to deliver. The delivery driver is just as frustrated as I am and apologises when he knocks on the door, again.

They are now sending invoices for late payment fees.

Customer service is useless."
"$200 international delivery supposed to have customs and brokerage covered and arrive by 2-3 days. A week later it’s sitting in a warehouse in my city getting scanned everyday to collect fees with zero notice or attempts at delivery. I called to figure out what’s going on and the rep blamed me and said they needed my ssn. Over the phone. They are beyond bad service to the point of bad faith/scamming. It’s clear they plan(ned) to:

1. Let the package sit in the warehouse to wrack up storage fees
2. Never deliver it within a reasonable time frame. You don’t hear about it until they send an invoice months later
3. Charge brokerage and run it as a Lacey act parcel when it doesn’t meet that criteria (over $2500 or for non-personal use per CBP guidance) and when I have to file that paperwork. Which again shouldn’t be happening bc it doesn’t meet Lacey act criteria
4. Choose the wrong harmonization codes so I pay more customs and they get a better brokerage fee. They have done this to me several times in the past, and getting the fees rectified is a nightmare. To them, “it’s free money!” And that will always trump any other concern.
5. Wait months to contact me about any of this despite an active UPS account and 3 ways to contact me.

In short stay away from UPS for international and **use clicktrans** instead. UPS clearly has no interest in following actual CBP guidance and rules for imports when they can commit errors to bring in slightly more cash. No interest in delivering packages that ship at a high premium with global express and will not have appropriate candor when you inquire. Again don’t import or export with UPS unless you and your receiver can stomach a 50-75% surcharge above and beyond their already above market rates."
"Wish it was 0 stars. UPS used to be such a reliable company, but now even if you pay $100 for domestic shipping on a 2 lb box, for overnight service, they STILL cant do that. And that order was placed bc the original Ground order was so delayed and I needed to definitely receive it. The funny thing is, my hub orders off Amazon, and they are NEVER late. So I guess it's just the full paying, non corporate customers who cant get their things now. You'll notice most of the positive reviews here are from Amazon orders. This is what woke, corporate America looks like. We foot the majority of the bill, and get nothing for it. UPS is a joke, don't waste your money.

Update on another package that shipper sent UPS ground: Delay! After being in UPS' possession for 13 minutes and its already delayed. However, my hub and daughter both ordered Amazon, and they are on time and 1 day early. If this doesn't tick you off, you don't understand what is going on. This is a giant corporate takeover, and small businesses cant compete if UPS delays every single one of their packages. So if you had to choose between buying the same exact item from small business or Amazon, and one takes 2 days to get to you, and the other takes 5+ with constant delays, which do you think most people would buy? Amazon. If you dont think this is intentional and to harm you, you deserve what is coming to you."
"I Received my express mail one week late. Was waiting on my new debit card that should of been delivered the next day, but sadly it wasn’t. One or 2 days, sure that would be cool, but 8 days. UPS has to be the slowest, most unreliable delivery service there is."
Tried multiple times to get a real person. My package was due in 4 days ago still not here. Its showing still enroute from the same hub. I don't like using ups and this is just another example of why
"I received notification over 2 months ago that a package I sp[ent $180 on had been delivered. Since I was sitting at my home desk and no one actually showed up. I was curious. No package on the porch or anywhere else could be found. I call UPS and told them. They Sent me a letter saying it had been delivered. I said to Who? Crickets. No response. So i called again and refiled a claim. This time they sent out my UPs mail carier and he admitted he had not come by my home in weeks. So I filled out a document for him. He appologized and then I waited. After month, I contacted UPS again and was told they had proof it was delivered. ""Same document that said it was delivered as before"". I told them I have a camera and there is no UPS driver that has come to my home.. I have 3 months of video to prove that no one ever showed up. There sent out the same UPS driver as before and he was just as curious as I was. So we filed out the paperwork.. Again!! and then waited. Again.. Called them back and they say they closed the file since it was ""Delivered"". UPS couldnt tell you anything else and have just refused to even discuss the claim. So i'm out $180 and the giant pieces of cow manure get to keep on making money. What a garbage run organization. Send Fedex from now on. Screw UPS."
"The worst and irresponsible company…I sent an important envelope overseas for two days delivery I paid extra but the envelope never arrived on time I’m very sad and dissatisfied because I trust them with something very personal and important, when I call customer service they don’t give me an accurate response."
"So easy to order, shipping was very fast and my horse and I are especially pleased with our order. Will order again. I have referred several friends to your site."
"Sent a small package to CA (USA) from uk
Package was delivered.
Received invoice from UPS for ‘address’ correction charge of £9.15 ( long with threat of the right to add interest and take court action for recovery cost ! ) because it seems I didn’t write the apartment number on the label ,( though every other aspect of the address was correct) which i didn’t have because the client didn’t give me and the agent at the UPs centre never asked me for !
So despite the package going to the right building and being delivered UPs want to scam me for more money !
Tried calling them using their website autodial. Only way to call them on the numbers given is to hand dial or all you get is you have dialled incorrectly !
Then got an agent ( full name not given ) who clearly didn’t want to help other than to say the package was delivered so ignore that invoice !
When I asked for that great bit of advice in writing I was told sorry we don’t have access to email . Oh and don’t ask to talk to a supervisor as they are too busy apparently so I left my email in the hope someone from invoicing contacts me before the bailiff arrives !
Won’t ever use this lot again ."
"I went to drop off a package. I needed UPS to print the label from my email. The lady did an excellent job, and it took her only a few seconds to print the label and give me a receipt. She was kind and courteous. This was at store number 6650."
"Company managed to lose a entire transfer case that had costed me nearly $700. If you have a choice, use a different shipping company, this is the 4th time UPS has screwed up my shipments in just the past few months."
The worst!! I sent a box and well it arrived empty!! And the compensation was less than half. Please don’t use this service
If i could I would put a zero star if I could they deliver my package to a difrent store
"Very bad customer service. All the representatives are overseas. So many people here locally needing work and UPS decides to employ customer service reps out of the country. They are not trained adequately at all. It’s challenging to convey messages to them and to understand what they are saying. I find myself repeating my issue and getting even more frustrated that they still don’t get it. I spoke with 8 reps yesterday from overseas and all of them told me something different, and each one also reassured me that they were the ones giving me the correct info. This is a complete circus of a place. There is no more integrity in one’s work and companies are underestimating the value of providing good customer service."
No one knows where my package is. All the customer service representatives are Indian with very low IQs.
"I received a damaged product via UPS from Overstock ( that's another review) and I am now attempting to find a drop location that will accept this rather large box AND will accept a mobile label. The UPS website lists locations with clear specifications on package size and whether or not mobile labels are ok. Unfortunately, there website is wrong. I have transported this package to drop locations only to be told that they won't accept it. When told that their website clearly states they will they still refuse to take it. I will no longer buy from sites that ship UPS, it's just not worth the hassle."
"I purchased the Wild River women’s long boots. They are excellent quality and very comfortable. They are true to size.
They are taller than my previous Mountain Horse riding boots. Happy with this purchase. Also, very prompt delivery!"
Where is my parcel? Your service is terrible !!
"I have my son from NJ staying with me for a few months, he requires special injectable medication once a month, hey shipped it from Nj to Colorado ""next day"" knowing it was medication, $4000 for 1 shot. Box marked Perishable They real dont care, all we got was a run around, filed a claim been waiting 2 days and nothing... Never count on UPS big mistake if you do!!"
They delivered my package. But the young man that came. Got got on my cable wire that was coming across the telephone pole with his big truck. He pulled the wire disconnecting my internet and cable. And the siding off my house. I called the service phone number and was told someone would call me. Still waiting. This was on the 16th of aug.
"I was in a rush to send legal documents to Honduras. Since UPS was the closest option available we bought the fastest delivery  option and paid more than $110.00 to ensure this documents arrive within 2 days. Package took about 6 or 7 days in transit.they used every single excuse to justify this delay : first they said they do not deliver in this area, (total lie, address is in the middle of a main city and all couriersarrive here), then they said they do not deliver in Honduras ,called the person who was supposed to received the package and charged extra since they used a third party.
When I placed a claim, they said it was detained by customs. One lie after another. They would not adjust the price we paid to the delivery time it took.
NEVER AGAIN,never using ups again. Iconstantly send packages with Fedex and Purolator and never had an issue.It is unacceptable how ups doesn't take responsibility."
"Did not follow instructions to leave it on my enclosed porch, that has CAMERAS. Instead, they just never delivered it!!! Can't change anything on their website or app and need the item asap, hence why I PAID FOR overnight shipping!!! When I called, I get some idiot that doesn't know what Im talking about and can barely speak english!!! GTFO"
"My package will be at the UPS facility today, Friday (12 miles from my home) but I'm supposed to get it on Monday because they don't deliver on weekends. I called customer service and they said I can't pick it up unless I request a hold on the package but I still wouldn't be able to pick it up until the next business day which is Monday.🤦so its going to sit in a hot warehouse for 2 extra days."
"Just awful service. Never received my parcel. Usually deliveries within Europe work quite well, but this is definitely not the case with UPS.

According to UPS tracking service in their website my parcel is delivered to ""N.A , N.A , REMOTE AREA , 00000 , FI"", which is some kind of black hole existing nowhere. Their website application to change delivery called ""My Choice"" does not work, just gives an error message. I called customer service and they promised call from local UPS in an hour. Never got that.

Advise: consider using other delivery companies or if not provided by webshop, consider shopping somewhere else instead."
"Ups more like we don’t deliver or communicate with you to deliver your parcel😞😞
And to think people call other courier firms
This is definitely not worth 1 star
Avoid at all costs and try and find a better one if you can
Good luck"
"UPS has to be the worst parcel carrier on the planet. Directors who take a salary but do not give a dam about customers. Call centres who abysmally lie, ignore and generally do not give a f. Pure 1st class mupets at clearing centres. Making millions charging import tax that is banked for days before being transferred to HMRC.
Totally unacceptable, never responding to actual questions. Imposing ridiculous charges way beyond parcel value. All in all UPS are the Useless Parcel Service."
"Generally not a good experience in the city (better in the countryside). Drivers who are scheduled to do pickups don’t ring the bell or call, just leave a door notice even when you wait for them all day (had this experience several times w AMZ returns). Then when you call UPS and complain and eventually speak to a dispatcher all they do is offer to send another driver out with a 4hr wait window. They expect you to hand over packages to them without shipping labels because they don’t empower drivers to print labels. Insane. The stores are even worse for drop offs. If you just show up w a digital shipping label they charge you a fee to print one for them!!!! They are already getting paid for the shipping. Ridiculous company. Highly erratic and not a great customer experience. They’ve even left deliveries of expensive items on the street in NYC where they can be easily stolen because they are too lazy and time pressured to actually make sure it gets inside the door of an apartment building. Shameful."
"I am super angry about my delivery, if the package was not delivered why does it shown delivered. It’s just ridiculous because now I have to go pick up the package myself from is UPs center.

Address and name was correct and yet UPS was unable to make the delivery to the right location. I just don’t understand."
"Threat of disaster, every time. They try, really hard, I’m sure. But it is just such a confusing and awkward experience every time, even when you do get your hands on your delivery.
Their app and website are just Kafka in digitalized form. If given the choice, stay away from UPS."
"Package did not arrive when their email said it should. Called them and was told it was waiting at a facility 40 minutes away. That’s was not the agreement it was supposed to come to my house. They deliver here all the time. The facility said they had no idea where my package was. Called UPS again and they said it was sitting in their facility half way across the US. Filed a claim and was told it would take 15 days to resolve. Got a call from investigations and was again told they had no idea where it was. When I related all my steps including their email saying when it was supposed to be delivered I was told UPS doesn’t email. For god sake I get an email every time they are the shipper, but this girl was adamant they don’t email. If I did not need this part so bad it would be funny. Worst part is they are better than DHL!"
"Your customer service is horrible, your managers do not know how to work with individuals.

I tell your company what happens with issues and they just ignore me. I cannot stand the way your company operates it's disgusting.

I filed a complaint and never heard back from anyone. Why would anyone want to work with your company.

They damage my items, if I ever get them. You constantly send them to drop off points and I am pretty much home getting emails from your automated system though I am home and nothing happens.

Calling local branches people telling me I'm wrong and that your company screwed up. You have over , 29k work of negative 1 starts and not enough 5 tells you that your executive brand sucks and looking into solutions might be helpful"
"I just don’t get it, I live in Sweden and EVERY time that I’m forced to order via them (when seller doesn’t have any other option) I get SMS that package was delivered to a post office since I wasn’t at home, all those times I was at home! They never call, never knock on the door, never even try to deliver home, just send this message and that’s all! Once I paid to have the package delivered to me since the package was big and the office they deliver to is 15 min away….and as usual..all day long at home waiting and get their message that I was not at home. How hard can it be? All other companies have always delivered to my address when I chose it! I wouldn’t be so mad if they just offered delivery to a postal office directly, why do they have to lie about home delivery and how can they get away with it??"
"the delivery was OK (denmark), but I had too many spam mails sent. for instance I received 4 mails saying it was being delivered. and 3 more when it was delivered."
"(in Spain) NOT serviceminded
(in Spain) NOT serviceminded. I have a very difficult to find address. I have made additional notes to make it easier for the carrier to find it. No even attempet to call and ask for direction is made. Instead they sensd an email - delivery cant be made. No english at all on their spanish site. When i call - just something in spanish - no choice of choose english to understand what they are saying. Totally unprofessional or just very low educated staff, supervisors and CEO?"
Day 1 they said they tried and nobody home. There was 2 people at home. Day 2 they said delivery in morning at 4pm they said delivered and outside house. We were home it was not delivered. They said driver left outside wrong house. Numerous phone calls finally got item on day 3.
"Worst service ever!
They loses my packages all the time. It’s impossible to get something delivered by them. They pretend to come deliver, don’t leave any attempt proof and after 3 days they hold my packages 10 miles away from my address asking for $8 to have it in hold at one of the 2 locations I have between 0.4 miles from my home.
If they show up at my parking lot, instead of taking the packages out the truck, the drivers takes a nap until shift is over. I took a picture of this happening but the customer service refuse to knowledge it."
"I have been calling- e-mailing. And texting. NO RESPONSE! THEY KEEP GOVING ME A RUN AROUND .THEY DAMAGED MY STEPS AND THE PRODUCT. TWICE, YES TWICE.... DO NOT USE THEM..THEY DON'T CARE!!!"
"I sent some legal documents to an old address. When we realized the mistake, we were concerned about how to redirect the documents to the correct address. However, UPS self corrected my mistake. They realized the address was wrong, found the new address and delivered the package. Way to go UPS!"
Log cabin pancake house in gatlinburg Tennessee wants to thank Mike Marky for his hard work. We have several packages a week and he is always on the ball. Best driver we’ve ever had!
"supposed to be 2 days delivery, 1 week later still waiting, I lost 2 days waiting but no luck , of course they lie about delivery attempts every time and its been 2 days saying they will drop in collecting point but no where to be found. worst company ever."
"Make it impossible to get in touch with them, paid for faster shipper and they took the package back because no one was home even though instructions said to leave anyway."
"I sent a package on 7-27-22 for overnight delivery. It did NOT arrive until two days later. I requested a refund. Two weeks later, I received a refund that was $7.79 less than what I paid for the service. I have been on the phone for over 4 hours trying to get my $7.79 refund. The local store keeps giving me the corporate numbers, and the corporate numbers that I call keep telling me to call the local store. To me, this is a great example of customer service at it’s worst"
Terrible support service! Been trying many months to log in to my account & rejected everytime. I called & followed the directions but it just keeps giving me the runaround. Person kept telling me it was me or the computer even saying that I mispelled my name! My screen shows everything is correct. I just give up & just can't have their app. Horrible customer service!!!
"They just say you were not home.
When you want to register on their website, the site will just throw an error and won't let you register."
"Rubbish service, UPS is possibly the worst company to deal with when you have issues with your account or parcels going missing. They have no direct line to fix problems and when you phone them you get a run around with no resolution. Having been a business customer for nearly a decade I still have no direct account manager or contact to call on and if you e-mail them they take days or weeks to respond and still don't resolve the issues.
Recently I have found I have been overcharged for most of my parcels sent over the last year or more. If you are a business customer I recommend you check your rates Vs what it costs to send via a private user - you may be surprised at the difference.
I can see now why many businesses are switching to DPD or other services. I am posting here in the hope that someone from UPS will get in touch....Unbelievably bad service."
"The incompetent employees of customer service of UPS Germany do not read my emails carefully, but simply kick them to other branches. Look UPS Germany, the fault is yours, but not UPS-in-the-other-country!"
"I also start to have terrible experiences with this company. They start to overcharge me for things that were already ok. I shipped from UK 4 times in 3 months and from any other courier at least 150+ times in 6 months, for my Danske Klar company, and the result is that I never got overcharged or sent bill for export papers that were done already. My sellers always made the papers with my company information and with my VAT ID. Stealing 8€ from every customer its a billion a month, and thats how this companies get rich. Someone at federal level should do something to stop this scam."
Do your drivers read english?I have a sign that reads please other door with a large red arrow pointing to it.must be blind or illiterate!
"I had two pictures shipped from Allentown, Pa to Florida with insurance for $476 and both pictures were damaged. After speaking to several people nothing was done although they did have someone come to pick up the pictures, which meant I'm out $476 and $800 for the pictures and receive nothing in return. Finally after a month Damage Control said I should receive a refund. Still waiting another month. Called Allentown, of course no one answers the phone so left message. Moral of this story is to NEVER buy insurance because they do nothing about the damage!!!!! T. Hill"
For the past several weeks whenever I have received a package of something I ordered on Amazon my boxes have been shipped UPS. They have come looking like someone played soccer with them. Your service is horrible. I have quit ordering from Amazon because of how damages my orders have come. I will never use UPS again and will tell others to do the same
"UPS would be a lot cooler if they were FedEx or USPS. Anytime I order something that gets shipped via UPS it's almost guaranteed to be a day late and at a pick up site, which sort of defeats the purpose of a delivery service."
If I could give lower than a one I would. I have left work and come home to receive a pkg from UPS and the driver puts a sticker on the door without trying to deliver. Packages are damaged!! Worst service ever and they do nothing to correct the problems! NOTHING!!
"They make it almost impossible to find out how to put on a free vacation hold, but make it very easy to pay to reschedule. It seems to be a shameless dark pattern to wring out extra dollars from customers.

To do a vacation hold if you actually manage to find out how, they don't simply deliver after the vacation ends. (unless you pay extra!) Instead you have to select an ""access point"" i.e. local ups store/facility to hold your package for pickup.

It sounds nice but somehow a day after the access point is selected they'll email saying they will not be able to deliver to the access point that UPS itself proposed. They'll send an email saying it will be delivered at the original schedule location and time, i.e. when you're out of town.

But It won't be delivered, instead the tracking will show an exception and say that they are trying to contact the receiver. But You (the receiver) won't receive any phone calls or emails from UPS, because they aren't actually making any attempt to contact you, at least not in any visible way.

And despite the online tracking saying they need your input, there won't be any way to do it online or any direction on how to resolve it. Their automated phone tree however will repeatedly suggest you go online for help.

If you call in they'll tell you it's actually already at the access point that the online system said it wasn't delivered to and they're going to send it back to the sender after another day, but when you go to the access point it won't really be there.

And so it's back to calling UPS and fighting the worst phone tree ever to just try to talk to someone even although last time they gave false information. I still don't have my package. This kafkaesque nightmare hasn't ended."
"I live in Quintana Roo. I order items from Amazon all the time. All other carriers: DHL, FedEx, and other global shippers always find my address and deliver my packages. UPS is the ONLY one who claims my address is incorrect and can’t be found. I’ve never had a package delivered by UPS successfully. Every. Time. I called, explained my address, gave them a local number to give the driver my GPS location, and STILL, UPS can’t deliver my packages! I called Amazon to request that UPS be removed from delivering my packages. Why is it so difficult? No one in the call center has been able to help. Terrible, terrible incompetence. How can every other carrier find my address but UPS can’t?!"
"My package was marked as not being delivered because I wasn't home at the time of delivery. However, I was home all day and no one knocked on any of my doors. Then they wanted to make me go pick it up from an access point when whoever was delivering could do their job right. Then, when I go to call about it using the customer service number on google, I go back and forth with the automated system for about 10 minutes because it won't just let me speak to a person for a situation that the automated system could not help me with. It was only after I told the automated system I wanted to file a complaint did it send me straight to a rep. Ridiculous!!"
UPS must be the worst company I have had the misfortune to deal with in over 40 years of business.They give incompetence a bad name
Really hard to run a business when you jerks keep losing my packages!!!!! Or damaging them!!!! Worst company EVER!!!!
Once again!!! Parcel lost!!! No one has replied to my emails it’s been two months and the status hasn’t changed for a week. The parcel was just going round in circles and now it’s stopped! I honestly cannot believe it has happened again. I will never order anything again from America because this company cannot deliver overseas!!! Update! Still nothing and no response to the three emails I have sent!
The voice recording is the worst I've ever experienced. I hope to never contact UPS again.
UPS FAIL It’s been 7 days now for a 48hr package. The tracking number gives me a estimate on time for delivery for the last 3 days but now nothing and no longer appears out for delivery. Not the 1st time this has happened. I wish people would stop using UPS as there are better ways to send things.
"Very fast delivery, professional, polite, kind and helpful personnel."
"I paid a company an extra $20 for a 2-day air shipment. The letter arrived in Oakland, CA on the 17th. I tracked it, and it said out for delivery by 7:00PM. I stayed at home all day and UPS never came. The next day the tracking info change delivery to that day by 7:00pm - no UPS. It has not been out for delivery since then. There is a note that says the recipient was not available for delivery on the first delivery date. NOT TRUE!! Not only that, no sticker was left - nothing. FIVE days later I am on the phone attempting to arrange a pick-up. Tracking now says 'processing at UPS facility'. Talking to rep who thinks perhaps the letter is lost. This the THIRD incident of delayed or lost items with UPS."
"UPS WAS a reputable company, now they SUCK! They evidently don't deliver packages to home or local mailbox any more, but a local Delivery Site, but they don't even tell you this in the notifucation email. I will do everything I can to switch to USPS or any other company! Oh, by the way, it's literally impossible to get a person on the phone at UPS."
They are super hard to deal with. Their online help is trash. They are literally never on time. Then when I finally got to speak to someone he was a total dick. I'm not a review writing Karen person. The service was so bad that I had to write one. This is so bad that I'll only order through certain people so I don't have to deal with fedex.
"As of today's date, 22nd August 2022, I was informed by UPS that my package was delivered on 19th August, but I have yet to receive my jacket. I know this is not the fault of the retailer, but rather the courier service, but it does take away from the service experience unfortunately."
Trying to track a package is a nightmare. You can't understand the personnel they hire from other countries. They lie and basically useless.
"I recently had a package delivered via UPS in Melbourne, Australia. It arrived today and it was pouring rain for most of the day. The delivery driver left my package in a safe place out of the rain, and out of sight from the road. They also ensured that they left a slip informing me of the location of my package.
Thank you, UPS for going above and beyond and ensuring my package stayed safe until I got home."
"I wish I could do no stars!!! Worst customer service ever!!!!!!!!!! I went to track my package only to say they tried to deliver but couldn’t!!! My door stands alone, no locked entry. All they had to do was read directions!!!! Now I can’t reach anyone in customer service. It says calls will be monitored then they don’t let you speak to anyone!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"My packages sit at the local warehouse for a week or more before even being assigned an estimated delivery date, even though UPS drives through my neighborhood twice a day. Sometimes, our packages are even dropped off at my local post office for delivery. It has taken us a month to receive packages from within the continental US. Packages are consistently battered as though they were thrown multiple times. The last UPS delivery person who came to our door broke my cactus in half! I think he threw my package and it hit my cactus plant. But I open my door and he’s running towards the truck and my poor cactus is on the ground next to a box that looked like it had been run over after being on his truck for a month. (And yes, it took well over a month for them to deliver this one too). I ordered fresh fish through Seatopia via overnight delivery. My fish sat in their warehouse for days rotting before I received it. Don’t bother with customer service. After hours of trying to get through, they insulted me and said that all of my packages were on time because they never assigned an estimated delivery date. I don’t know how these guys are still in business, but I will continue to complain to everyone I order from about the shoddy service. USPS is cheaper and better by far."
"For my last 4 packages, they lost 3. Two were never found (tracking did not move at all), and I got refunds from the shippers. The third one suddenly appeared 10 days late in one of their local warehouses, probably because I reported is as never received and asked to pay the damages of $270."
"It’s been over 9 days since it was expected to deliver and they haven’t updated or said anything about it yet.So useless,they are a delivery company but can’t even deliver my package still and i’m still waiting as i’m typing this.So slow it would’ve been faster for me to do it myself ."
If I would've read some of these reviews I wouldn't have used UPS but I believe certain companies choose who will do their shipping instead of the consumer. UPS hires selfish children and inconsiderate adults. Bad enough to have to worry about thieves then toss in elementary employees... geez!
No recycle bin for a box to return item to amazon. Really!
If I could leave 0 star I would worst company on the planet customer service sucks (period) absolutely sucks trash people and delivery drivers are a little on the slow side I have correct address and they drop packages off where they please and they leave their company allowed this!!!! Stupid people if you have an option to use fed ex they are so much better
"UPS is just that - useless piece of crap. I have two (2) days that I have waited for a delivery. One was to be delivered by Noon. It did not arrive until 4:57 p.m. My business day was gone. Today, it was to be delivered by Noon, they said they attempted delivery - LIARS. They deliver every day in my building - WHY NOT TODAY???? pieces of crap - NO ONE CARES EITHER."
Two day shipping watched the driver back in the driveway stop not get out and then pulled back out now it says I have to wait three more days for it to be delivered. Customer service individual said she couldn’t change the date and then said we can try and change. I gave up worried they’d mess it up even more.
"I had a large, bulky and heavy package to return. I left a note outside by the garage, asking the driver to ring my phone (the pickup order had my phone number on it) but he did not oblige. Instead, he just counted this as my one available pickup attempt and stuck the info on my gate. I did not want to leave a perishable--albeit already damaged item--outside on the ground, given that we're having an active monsoon season here in AZ. Terrible service... They will not attempt pick up again even though I provided the necessary information, so the driver could call me to open the garage door. It would have been so simple...and rational and accommodating."
"UPS has followed a rather profitable business model over the last few years. Deny adherence to any delivery estimates and charge more money. If you need something delivered on time, DO NOT EVER rely on UPS for on time delivery. Their entire system is a crumbling mess and they routinely mark packages as delayed for severe weather, even when no weather is anywhere near your package or its route. Avoid them if you can."
"I brought a package and they told me it was gonna be deliveride saturday , but ıts delivered tuesday I called customer service but did nothing"
Was told package would be delivered today and guess what? For some unknown reason it will not be delivered. It’s just beyond frustrating tired of excuses I didn’t ask for the date but was told by ups today back to fedx for our shipping needs
Next day delivery turned up a day late and caused serious problems.
"A place where you pay for tracking and signature required but the tracking isn't accurate so you'll have to drive an hour to pick it up because you won't know when to be home because the delivery Date keeps changing or even disappears completely. UPS is the only company that can knock on my door without anyone in the house hearing the knock... Not even the dog barks, and she normally barks if people just walk on the road in front of the house. Amazing!"
"This company is good at lying l. Delivery driver claims to have attempted to deliver parcel but had intact not even tried to deliver the parcel as I was home all day waiting! Trying to get to the bottom of this and waiting for a reattempt delivery, from doing little to receiving a huge load of information on how the drivers are thief’s and many others have experienced the same thing. Disgusting and embarrassing and further action will be taking place if another fib has been encountered"
"UPS charged me $5.99 to hold a package at a UPS location. They did not and now will not refund my money. The customer service people barely speak English, dumb as rocks and lie."
"the delievery person just didnt showed up when I was waiting whole day long.
Then in the system it says that he tried to deliver but nobody is at home.
messing around and kidding me.
UPS is bad as hell."
"I usually dont' write reviews but I wanted to advertise that this is really a bad company! I wish they fail and close down! They have exchanged sender and recipient and sent back my package after one week of being in a limbo! And moreover, I have been called 3 times and every empoloyee said a different excuse about what happened! One of them was very impolite! She misunderstood me and when I have tried to explain better, she insinuated that I had sent the package to myself and that I was lying about my location!!!! seriously???? how can someone like this work in a company that is supposed to be serious?? Do not use UPS!!!!! NEVER!!!"
I would not even give them one star. My package was picked up 10 days ago. My package is delayed due to the weather in Ukraine. It was picked up in Indiana and going to Texas. Why is my package delayed because of the weather in Ukraine. That's b*******!!
"August 2022 - I paid for expedited delivery services with UPS. I needed an essential package on Wednesday. Thursday at the end of the day, I received a notice it wouldn't be delivered until sometime on Friday. That is two days after I needed it. Calling UPS is futile. You can't access a live person. Attempts at a resolution on their website are equally frustrating. As a small business owner, I intend to avoid UPS. I can not allow inadequate service from a supplier to negatively affect my business. Sometimes a company grows to be so massive that they forget their customers. Clients should never have an issue interacting with a supplier."
"Once again the delivery person left my.package outside my door even though the parcel is designated to be signed for by me & no instructions or permissions was ever given to leave it at my door, neighbor, or 3rd party business. What is the point of having a ups online account that gives me options to protect & safeguard my valuable shipment when the idiot delivery person will not follow simple instructions or doesn't care to read it? These are the reasons I rarely order online now."
"In trying to resolve an issue with a package sent via UPS, I attempted to contact their customer service. It took me six calls to get past the automated response robot that wouldn't transfer me to a rep no matter what I asked for. Then when I finally got a rep, the issue was entirely ignored and no resolution was even attempted, let alone reached.
What a horrible way to run a company. They should be available to speak with their customers rather than hiding behind their automated answering service. They clearly do not care about their customers.
Grade: F (Only because there is nothing lower!)
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!"
"Lazy, Lying and unreliable delivery drivers, second time now in a row that delivery driver has stated that they attempted a delivery that they never attempted at all. I know this as my intercom at premises is about 2ft away from me, and I have been home all day. If I were looking for a reliable delivery company to ship goods, I wouldn't use UPS tbh."
"Very professional company, kept me updated with my delivery from Sweden to Denmark to Germany to U.K. and to final destination."
"Used to be great. Ever since the great excuse (Covid-19) they have become the most unreliable delivery company. For a while I could understand. Now that is just an overworked excuse. Multiple cases of delivery being ""end of today's date"" changing to ""on the way"" at any random time which can mean delayed at least one more day if not two or more. At this very moment have a package at their local facility (not even 16 miles away) since 4:51 AM which always meant the same day delivery, now means a day or more later. Used to be able to hold a package for pickup for free. Now they want to charge $7.99 for them to save their gas and not deliver?? Service is now like that in some third world country. Every chance I get I use ANYONE else. None of the alternate choices are this bad."
"Worst experience again with UPS, firstly they misplaced my package and on top of that they attempted delivery which is in the tracking.
I have already had the delivery option that was selected to drop at access point a day before and they lie that the delivery was attempted at the Access point and the access point was closed - which was a complete lie. I called the Access point and they were open all day.
What a pity, UPS doesn't even have a feedback site to lodge complaint. And the customer support simply mentioned about options which don't even work.
Also, I mention that this experience make me not use UPS in the future and they were like its fine if you dont want to. Grow up UPS. Its a very shameful service that you do to your customers. And I am now literally never going to use your business, never."
"This is the WORST delivery service available!!! Delays, delays, delays!!!
Every order is a nightmare!
Even the automated system is bad! You have to literally YELL into your phone so I can recognize your response!
DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS!!@"
"An overnighted delivery, which I paid for, is now over a week late and a lost package. Don’t worry guys! I get to submit a claim now. Refund? Yeah right."
We love our UPS driver Jared. He knows where we like our packages to be place in our office and picks up any packages that need to go out without being ask. He is the BEST!!!!
"If you want your package 'picked up' and left with a mystery two weeks later as to the status, UPS is the company for ALL your shipping needs~ 'Picked Up' followed by digital cricket noises"
"Worst company I have ever had to deal with. Can’t talk to anyone who knows anything, as for a supervisor and told can’t. Leave email for someone to call and ignored. Every day is different reason for parcel not arriving. Parcel now 3 weeks late. Would be cheaper to fly to country where parcel is and collect it yourself."
If no issues with delivery they are good. If you need to file a damage/loss claim the absolute worst you can imagine. The level of incompetence of every level of the customer service department leaves me drained. The $2 savings by not using FedEx Ground is definitely not worth the hassle.
"Ups is pathetic. They will give u a delivery date an the day its suppost to be there they change it. Or if u try to change the delivery date even well in advance they charge u for it was tring to change the date they excepted it an still delivered the damn package on the day I didnt want them to. In still tries to charge me. I had boxes coming from dish to return my equipement. No one needed to sign for anything. I placed a small table outside with a note that said please leave box on the table that way ants wont get into it. I get home my note on the door was gone but they left one saying they were returning it to one of there stores but never mentioned which one. I tried calling every store in they area the next day its all automated no pne answers the phone so about 1300 I recheck the website an they were returning an mty fricking box back to dish. With a message I refused to except the package thats a lie they should have dropped it like I said. They lied straight up tring to get dish to charge me for the equipement. I called dish told them what happen even they said ups sucks. An emailed me a label which I will but on my own box an drop it at the store. I asked dish if I needed to sign for it he said hell no its a box. They should have left it
Pathetic business thats why fed ex kicks their ass. Have never had a problem with fed ex"
Worst delivery service in the whole world. Fu*k off UPS!
Parcel was Meant to be deliver at set hours parcel is still in depo after me taking the day off work to receive called customer service and been on phone 2 hours no help would use this company ever again
"WARNING! Do not give them a penny! UPS have conned me and many others.

After paying for speedy international service, my delivery took over 5 weeks to arrive. OK these things happen, but there were no useful tracking updates or even accurate information/support available during the whole process. I have been overcharged twice, once for custom fees, plus a second charge (debited on statement), for which no one at UPS can find a reason for or a record.

I've wasted hours daily trying to get my money back. By now it's the principle more than the cost!!
Since delivery, they see the Tracking number: 1Z7BL21T6700024410 shows the item was delivered, as far as they are concerned, that's that.

Emails (to any address I can find), are not being replied to, tracked letters are unanswered and every avenue on the phone, redirects you to a dead end. No one is willing or able to resolve this. I'm calling it like it really is ''THEFT''.

£247.00 to post the items and then almost £100.00 in incorrect charges for a 5-week late delivery on a 4/5-day service.

Do not be Conned by UPS"
"They are the worst company ever. They did not deliver my item 3 times and it's the 4th time now. Every time I have to return it.

Can we all unite to stop using this worst shipping company?"
My order got pushed back 3 times after my order was shipped out. I’d understand if I had a order coming from a different state but my order was shipped from 3 towns away. Next time I’ll go get it from the store.
If I could it would be no stars for this garbage place. I am very frustrated the customer service is like talking to a wall. I have been chasing my package around Montana bc it’s so hard for them to do things right. This will be my last time my packages go through ups. I have called them 4 times and 3 of the people didn’t do what I asked. I also asked for there supervisor and the girl that was on the phone though a five-year-old tantrum and wouldn’t send me over bc she new crap was gonna go down. So whoever takes the time to read this DO NOT GO THROUGH UPS
"Terrible service, packages are delayed and then they changed the status to “no further details”. Called the customer service and they just push you to get off the phone.. company really went down hill"
Garbage…absolutely atrocious…I used them to ship my luggage and received only 2/3. Of course my most important suitcase is the one that’s missing … you can never get a hold of a customer representative and when you do they seemingly cannot help you. I’ve been receiving the run around and this entire experience has been awful. They just keep passing the puck to a third party that I booked the service through although they are the actual carrier. The handler never scanned the label on the third suitcase that was printed and because of that no one has any idea of it’s location or can help.
"They literally had one job, yet I’ve had 5 delivery issues with them, my 700 dollar package was sent back multiple times then lost, i have no idea how you lose a giant box with a bed frame in it, i had to reorder it and the price had raised, I did not get a refund from them, I have waited months for this and now they sent back the package again, costumer service was extremely unhelpful and told me the driver went to the wrong address, then basically drove away, i was told to wait to the end of the day for a call when the driver was less than five minutes away and could have just turned around. I gave them a call again and to find out they have now damaged my 700 dollar package which the person I spoke to ten minutes before failed to mention, they said someone called me after to tell me yet I never received a call, i then talked to the manager who transferred me to the damage department where the lady repeatedly told me the package was not damaged after I told her that the manger had just confirmed that with me, and was clear that they were so careless with such an expensive package that parts had fallen out, she would not believe me and she sent me back to customer service again where the other lady told me that my package was indeed damaged yet I cant file another claim, they are an unorganized, inconsiderate, failure of a business."
"Apple shipment though UPS is terrible. I normally have ZERO problems with DHL or FEDEX, but with UPS it seems that their system is not in synch with Apple e-mail info. So you basically can't track anything when they have got it wrong in the first place. Costs lot's of time/call's/ & and this is not what you expect from APPLE !"
I think we’d be better off having these useless mfs goin bankrupt and have everything delivered on horseback again.
the faggots told me my package was out at 9 in tha morning and they said i was gon get it by 7 pm it’s 9pm and they say i gotta wait now when i see the driver ima wanna punch with em cuh he tried me with my package
Garbage. Absolute garbage. Never on time. Updates say arrival today. Then get updated to “delivery date will be provided soon.” Happens almost every time we get a package via UPS. Then they can’t even tell you where it is. The Coppell Center loses half our damn packages and damages the other half. Absolute trash company.
"I sent a $200+ Waterford crystal bowl to a relative in Dallas and had it delivered to the McKinney Ave. UPS store for security (BIG mistake). I insured it for $300. About 6 days after it was delivered to the store, I became aware that my relative was out of the country for the week so I called the UPS store to tell them to just hold onto it until she returned. The lady who answered the phone took the tracking number and said it was never delivered to the store. There was no evidence/receipt in the system that the package was delivered to the McKinney store. I got the online receipt that said it was delivered and someone signed for it. But it didn't say it was the McKinney street store. So, I began my journey of calling all the UPS in the Dallas-Fort Worth area when I found time in my work day (I have a full-time job). I also asked my relative to see if it was inadvertently delivered to her apartment office (it wasn't). Calling all the stores took me a few weeks because the stores often don't answer their phones or they go directly to a recording. I also placed a track at the UPS store I used to ship it. I had paid them more than $49 to ship this bowl including the insurance. They put in a claim for me since I had purchased insurance. Within 24 hours, I got notice that UPS had closed the claim ticket since the package was ""delivered."" Where? WHO KNOWS? They refuse to even hear an appeal. I'm out more than $200 for the bowl and nearly $50 for the shipping and insurance. UPS sells insurance but they HAVE NO INTENTION ON PAYING ANY CLAIMS. I am going to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. It's my last chance of getting any resolution on this. I will also see if I can put in a complaint with the Texas attorney general's office."
The quality of service at UPS is terrible. In most recent incident the driver did not even attempt to deliver a package but instead redirected it to a UPS store. Why pay for shipping if the item is only partially shipped? FedEx doesn’t deliver your package to a remote location and make you pick it up. Complete crap. Don’t use UPS. Period
"The worst shipping company ever! I had three packages sent by Amazon, and SHEIN. Unfortunately All these packages were lost!! I have very bad experience with UPS. IDK what’s going on with them!!!"
"Ups is the worst. I have set up a pick up for a package and they never showed. Called, customer service they just says someone will call you back there is nothing we can do!! Seriously? I will never use ups again poor service and customer service is a joke!"
"After getting packages delivered to our residence for 22 years, we have an ongoing problem with packages being left a mile from our residence. Leaving packages on a public road a mile from the house is not acceptable."
Marken/ups. Didn't show up for pickup. I called and was told they came this morning. Was suppose to come in afternoon.
"Ordered an item from a vendor. Vendor sent package got email and text from
Vendor saying it was delivered. Item was never delivered from UPS. Had to track package and found out it was sent back to the vendor. The vendor resent the package out and got another text saying item was delivered. We ti front door item was not there. Looked on camera saw the UPS man come to the door no package in hand. Submitted a claim through UPS for lost package and they closed the case because the said it had been delivered. This is all done by computer or phone. You can’t call and talk to anyone. I’m out of hundreds of dollars because someone stole my items that works for them!"
They suck at every aspect of what the company is supposed to do.
"Item delivered to the wrong address, even though I was told that the change of delivery to the correct address had been done."
"Awful customer service. Package was delivered to our address for a previous tenant and they wanted me to drive it across town for them. Did ya get that? A package delivery company wanted me to transport a package for them. Then it took me well over 20 minutes just to get a human being on the phone to explain the situation, because apparently this is such an entirely foreign situation for a package delivery service that they didn’t even have an option in their automated system. So that resulted in being hung up on by a robot no less than three times."
"I ordered a company logo embroidered ball cap and UPS lost the package. I have initiated a claim with UPS. Prior to the claim, UPS informed me that the address was incomplete so I called the company that provided the ball cap and asked if the address they have is complete and it is. Update, UPS confirms that the package was lost and the claim has been settled."
I am working home office and I was all the time at home when I got 3 messages in a row everyday that no one was at home... I really needed to get the package on time! I hate ups
Totally useless for sending personal packages internationally. Hopeless and neglectful customer services and no refund when my parcel was abandoned.
"Ups work like shh1t. I waited all day they didn't ring the doorbell and said, no one is home. No, sorry shh1t because shhit is better than ups"
"The driver left a note on my door titled ""Sorry we missed you"" and did NOT deliver my package. My signature was not required to receive my package."
"UPS lost my package (1Z7T3F5P6720012616). They said it was damaged in transit and initially kept updating saying that it will get delivered once damage report is done.

Finally after almost 2 months, they came back saying it is lost/missing. Further I cannot file a missing lost package claim because it has been longer than the allowed duration to submit a claim. This takes no account of the fact that the ball has been in their court whilst the clock was ticking.

Zero responsibility for losing the package, instead blamed the shipper for poor packaging."
"The delivery drivers have left my mother's insulin deliveries sitting in the driveway the last two times it was delivered. This time even using the 1400 dollars' worth of insulin is in question as it was left sitting in the sun. The delivery location is always set to Front Door and both times they have literally just thrown the package off the truck and into the ditch beside our driveway. I have tried contacting customer support about this on multiple occasions and if I can get to an actual person, they always hang up on me. They are always incredibly rude and customer blame even when it is obvious the driver is at fault for a damaged package when he tosses it off the truck like a football with absolutely no regard that the package has TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE DELIVER TO CUSTOMER DIRECTLY on the side of the box."
Awful service They just throwed the package in front of my door no courtesy knock Or no care of ppl hard earned money going down the drain!! Those were $200 shoes that were left outside with no care!! Do better or hire better people just ridiculous!!
Every time I have ordered From EBAY and the item gets shipped to the wrong address and is always late
"My package was very poorly taped. The tape was falling off of the top and I had a lot of missing items 😕
The tape looked as if a 5 year old taped it. Over all it was a very bad experience!!!"
"Super bad experience. They couldn't consult me on the tax for sending personal laptop from Switzerland to Poland and therefore I've got a huge bill so I have no choice but sending it back. Now the parcel stuck and nobody answers the calls even thought call center works on Saturdays here. They don't reply on emails either regardless the week day. I cannot describe how incredibly terrible experience I'm getting with them right now. I'm nervous and loosing time, because can't get my laptop for work."
Pretty bad service. They don't even come to your house and go directly to their central delivery point to leave your package there. It's then up to you to go there to get your package. This a pretty poor service. Avoid UPS to send your package to a postal adress. Nathalie
UPS needs to fix the glitch in their systems. They have delayed shipping on five of my packages. It said it was supposed to be delivered today and then it changed to Tuesday. I get some things happen but 5 times is a lot. And to be honest I’m surprised it’s gone on this long.
"My Amazon return that I dropped off at the UPS store is lost, four days since it was supposed to be picked up and it just says ""label created"". The UPS website won't let me make a claim, the 800 number won't give me a person and hangs up on me, I'm out $70 with no recourse and UPS is probably snickering at me from behind their hands.

The girl at the counter probably sold my item on eBay.

Thieves."
"Awful service, never on time, indicates delivery dates that are never respected and impossible to know what happened to your package.

How those crooks are still in business is beyond me.
Avoid at all costs, just use DHL instead, they're not great either, but better than UPS."
"One star is too much but I had to put something. Our store prepared a special arrangement for a gentleman in Louisiana to propose to his fiancé. We paid for overnight shipping to the tune of 200+ dollars and they were to arrive at noon the next day. THEY NEVER LEFT OUR TOWN!! Our very sweet customer who planned his proposal for weeks has had it single handedly completely ruined by ups. He is proposing in an hour and we are beyond upset. We trusted UPS with a special customer and we were completely let down, not to mention the special proposal that our customer put so much thought into is ruined and whenever they get around to delivering them, he will have dead flowers. Thanks UPS. Real good job."
"Terrible Service! Booked a collection at 9:30am told will be collected by 5pm. 4:30pm still no collection, so phone customer services to be told someone will call me within an hour. Hour goes by no call! So, phone back again (its 6pm now) to be told no collection will be made today (Friday) will be Monday now! What the actual hell!! Why wasn’t I told this at 9:30am when the booking was made?!
Left in a position where I couldn’t make any other arrangements and out of pocket because of it! No compassion what so ever, because of their lack of communication business’s losing money."
I paid someone to wait for ups all day to receive my grandsons dirt bike and when they came they just walked up to the door and left a note saying no answer But I have the delivery on camera so I know they never knocked on the door. So now I have to wait until Monday when my grandbabies will be back home. So disappointed
"I don’t don’t even have energy to write about summary of my terrible experience and countless mistakes on the part of UPS.

Avoid UPS at all costs."
"Paid over $40 for a package to be delivered stuff was urgent, I choose the overnight shipping. Well me being calm actually gave them a extra two days so eventually it’s out for delivery and then they change it after a whole business day after being on a truck all day and said delivery for the next day instead. No refund. I could’ve just choose free shipping. No more ups. Customer service wasn’t much of a service either."
"UPS… you are doing me dirty! Package was supposed to be delivered on the 9th to my access point. Received message on the 8th that it could not be delivered there, to change to a new one. I did so. Received message that package will still arrive on time. Then on the 9th received a message that the apartment number was wrong and was corrected and will be delivered. But a following message says package will not be delivered until the 15th… yet it is in LA

I call customer service, they apologized for the confusion but that the package will be delivered on the 10th. 10th comes and goes. Only updated that it departed LA facility.
Today I check the app and says its delayed due to weather. Um….. there is no weather in LA.

Call customer service again and my package is now in Harrisburg, PA!! Apparently the driver never took my package off the truck and now it’s on an adventure. Absolutely infuriating and unacceptable. Why would they not just keep my package at an LA facility and have another driver take it to my second access point? Instead its all the way on the opposite coast.

And the most ridiculous part? The package is from a store in Burbank… not very far from me…"
"Terrible service. I have used UPS Sweden a few times because they were the only option to deliver my order on some shops. I always asked for home delivery and paid the asked prices. UPS Sweden NEVER deliver to our home address and ALWAYS said that they could not reach us so they sent the goods to the collecting point. They use this lie every single time. I stay home all day to wait for the delivery and ended up, I have to go to another location to collect my packages."
absolutely the worst company for delivering packages
Impossible to contact. I don't understand why I should provide all my info just when I need to recieve a parcel and have a tracking number under which are all my details that they need.
"The UPS Beaverton, Oregon on Murray and Allen Blvds, changed owners awhile back. The service is horrible and the workers are difficult to understand; they lie and take advantage of Amazon shoppers and charge for boxes when they are alreasy covered. I will not use UPS in the future."
"If there is an option for no star, that is what I would have rate this company. It’s the worst courier service I’ve ever used in my life. There failings is in all areas from not having any standards, to not keeping to any, poor customer handling everything. I sent my sisters phone which she forgot with me from London to Nigeria. UPS promised it would get there in 2 - 5 days. It took 3 weeks with various false information before it eventually arrived. Myself and sister at the other end had to be ringing 5 to 6 times a day at some point. The information on their tracking system kept changing. We did not know what to believe anymore. To top it up they charged my sister shipping clearance fee after I have paid dearly for the parcel and they never told me there are any extra charges required. The customer experience for us was gruelling.

My advice is DO NOT USE UPS if you want a prompt and good service."
Terrible service. They said they delivered my package 10 minutes ago but it's not my front door at all. I contact them on their website and the first thing to do is ask me to check my neighbors. How absurd is that. I did check the neighbors which is absurd but they didn't deliver it there either. I just installed new big address numbers on our house that are highly visible. UPS is horribly sloppy.
"I would give them negative stars if I could
What a garbage company full of rude , trashy people who have no respect for their customers
What kind of delivery service would have the audacity to leave a package that looked that way on someone’s doorstep?
I hope Amazon puts them out of business permanently!
And they will !"
"Useless, lazy service."
"I ordered a parcel, the goods were supposed to be delivered on the 8th, I waited all day, nothing was transported. They wrote to me that the address is wrong. I checked the address, I wrote the correct one to the support service. The goods were supposed to be delivered on the 10th, again nothing. The goods were delivered on the 11th, but at a different address and given to another person. It’s good that they were people I knew, and they gave me my order. The company, UPS, delivers parcels at the wrong time, even if you pay for fast delivery, and also on wrong address. And this is not the first time. This is the worst service I have ever met."
"NOOOOOO ability to reach a human for customer service. Got the complete voice message run around even though UPS requested more address information from me! This is the 2nd attempt at delivery of a package. The 2nd was delivered to an unknown address across the state, not even near the town addressed on the package! Just trying to get a birthday present to a family member with such frustration! The birthday is long missed and gift still not received!"
"I wish there is a zero to give you. you closed my claim without any investigation. I have a camera that shows that the guy did not stop by my house, I am going to sue you
Maged Joseph"
"There's no customer service, there are people who can talk to you (if you are patient enough to get thru) and then go back to watching youtube or whatever else they were doing prior to it without doing absolutely anything to help you with your issue."
"I booked for a collection but they never came.
What a rubbish!"
This company should not be in business. This is my worst delivery experience. For one week they have failed to deliver every time while stating that the receiver was not available. I've been stuck at home for a week because of them... They are lying about the deliveries and try to get me go to them to get the delivery. I'm still waiting...
My package wasn’t not delivered and yet they claim it was. Absurd nonsense.
"i cant stand UPS!
first off impossible to make an account and login. created an account with the email that my tracking number was sent to, told password was wrong to get a temp, which i did, temp password also not accepted. told to wait 30 minutes, after that time i was still locked out. tried the chat feature which was useless. i had to sign ahead for the package and they have a sign now feature listed in the email with tracking number which i couldnt use because my stupid account was locked. i work night shifts i sleep during the day, originally the delivery was supposed to be between 945-1045 am, nothing, then changed delivery time to before 1245. so i stayed up when i shouldve been sleeping.
i left a note for my UPS driving stating my buzzer for my apartment does not work to leave package or call me because of this and i got nothing!!! they didnt even update tracking saying it was on its way....absolutely ridiculous. waste of my time waiting around and they delivered my package to a ups store where i now have to go home and stay awake until they open to retrieve my package which was shoes for my job!!"
"They never seem to deliver packages directly to home even though it has been agreed upon. They say they were unable to deliver the package when there are no signs of anyone showing up. I have not had this problem with any other delivery service and would recommend any organization or company to stay away from their services. I have decided not to order from stores that use UPS and it wouldn´t surprise me if it scares other customers away. There are many good delivery services on the swedish market (Budbee, Airmee, Postnord, EarlyBird), in comparison UPS is incredibly bad on all fronts. Their site and app is like stepping into the early 2000s, there is no QR code to show at the post office, they are not linked to any of the big swedish postage apps (my parcels or postnord), no realtime overview of where the driver is or approximate delivery time."
UPS is terrible. They won't deliver to my house because of a dog that's fenced in. Won't even pull into my driveway. So I changed to have deliveries dropped off at a preferred location. Get an email at 11 am stating to pick up the package. I go there at 6:30PM and was told the package wasn't there and that ups does that alot where it's marked delivered but won't be actually delivered until the following day. Customer service was zero help and couldn't give me an answer.
"Absolutely the worst customer service on the face of the planet. Nobody is of any help. I tried to chat, call, and Twitter DM. All useless. I wish I could leave it zero stars"
Worst company ever they drivers lied about trying to deliver my package when I have them on camera never ever taking package off the porch they have cost me tons of money an use FedEx at all cost at this point I’ll use USPS before them!!
"UPS never deliver something!
I had the same problem with UPS delivery about 20 times. Every time I was at home, when driver called by Intercom I opened door, but driver was lazy to go upstairs and wrote that I am not at home. Once I was waiting at home 2 days in row, but both days driver didn't go upstairs and wrote that I was not at home.
UPS made also fraud and made tremendous disaster to me in 2016. I cancelled delivery of item which I didn't order and for which my credit card was fraudulently charged $300, cancelled 2 days before delivery date, but UPS ignored my cancelation and delivered it, left it to neighbors who signed. And the main trouble was that I received message about delivery just when was talking with US Supreme Court about the main case of all my life, case about tremendous and unprecedented crime and tragedy and extremely severe injuries made to me by corrupted NYC officials, case which I proceeded 7 years. I lost this case and many millions dollars compensation, lost because of UPS."
"If I could leave less than 1 star I would. The amount of issues I have had with UPS and lost packages, one after another and the CONSTANT delays in packages. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. Very difficult to get a hold of any customer service representative unless you have the store's direct number (and even that is sometimes hard to obtain). There is no follow up or accountability when there are issues with a package, and it is complete crap!"
"I was happy with the service,prompt and in schedule.I like to ask if I am not home what are the procedures? I am asking because I am thinking to buy another one rug."
"I was following closely the updates for my home delivery.
I realised that I could add some special instructions for it; after nightmarish attempts, I gave up on it, to later realised that the instructions for my home delivery were taken after all. Good. Next, a message saying ""sorry we missed you"" when I didn't move in the whole day expecting the package. Then, that message disappeared to be replaced by another giving an address to pick up my package. Why was it not delivered to my home??? Anyway, I went to the address for pickups. The address was wrong. After a while, with my husband's help, I could find ""a shop"" on another street, with no sign whatsoever that had anything to do with UPS that had my package waiting for me... What was all this about???"
"UPS failed to turn up at the promised time despite a 4 hour window, a day waisted and not a word of apology or explanation. Never use UPS. JOHN GORST"
"I honestly wanted to leave no stars here but wasn’t given option. Kinda like when UPS attempted to delivery my package with no delivery time and then proceeded to tell me I had to be available the next day for a four hour window, didn’t give me option to leave at my door and told me it would be an additional $8 to go out of my way to even pick it up at a pickup location. Way to go. I hope your rep I yelled and cussed out over the phone quits and you go out of business. Go **** yourself, UPS. I’ll go out of my way to never use your service again."
"I have had limited issue with UPS until recently. I had a package sent from West Coast to East Coast and the product was damaged. They refused to pay the claim. The shipper refunded my money and now has to fight with them to get any type of compensation. The product (an antique) was damaged beyond repair and will never have the value it once had.

I then ordered a couple of cedar chests in honor of my parents. They were meant to house the gowns my Mum made and wore as well as my Dad's Navy uniforms. They were inscribed to represent their passion as well as their initials. When I received the well packaged chests with FRAGILE stickers all over the boxes, they clearly were dropped and unintendedly moved/manipulated. The lid of one the the chests is chipped and the edging is pulled apart. The frame is pulled apart and additional chips are on the chest. On the other chest the corner was visibly used as a means to move the package.

In addition, the delivery of the 2 packages were dropped off (maybe DROPPED) at the head of my driveway about 300 feet from my house. These are bulky and awkward to move (on a dirt driveway). Additionally they are on their side when the stickers and markings on the packaging noted 'THIS END UP'.

To that end, I called UPS and was not able to get through their IVR. Apparently they are preventing easy access for any customer to talk to a Customer Service Representative. In addition I was instructed to lodge a complaint through the web site. However I got an error message when I tried to log in with my account information. I tried to change my password and got a major ERROR.

To fix my log in issue, I had to go through the Technical Support line to get to speak with someone. I was told the only way to lodge a complaint was to talk with someone. She was nice as anything, was from the US and spoke clear English - no heavy accent.

She directed me to the customer support phone number which was the infinite loop I was in before - she assured me she will get me to a person - which she did.

In any case, I was told I needed to send the items back to the shipper. I told the agent the delivery person would need to come to my house to pick them up but clearly they didn't know how to drive on a dirt road. I was then told I could take pictures and submit them.

I took the required pictures - and them some.

I got several calls noting they were waiting for the pictures and apparently they closed the case before I was able to upload the photos.

I uploaded the photos and the shippers was communicated with not me - apparently when you pay for the product and the shipping you have no rights!

We, the shipper and I are in regular communication, apparently they are denying the claim since the boxes were not 'certified'. Ironically, UPS took the insurance money and knowingly took the product for shipping.

One other thing I have surmised, UPS outsources their customer service AND it is all off shore. When the CSR noted 'They' have a policy, it was clear they are not connected with UPS. To eliminate any accountability, UPS keeps claims at arms length.

I am still working the issue - this complaint is due to my 'threat' to blog about the ineptness of UPS and how they are not holding their warehouses and workers accountable for irresponsible work behavior!!!

As a side not, I received a package from Samsung - packaged by Samsung - and it too was crushed to the point the Styrofoam was broken in multiple locations - I took pictures and did not want to place a claim since it is pointless and just creates more anger - on my part.

My recommendation would to look elsewhere for your shipping needs. This behavior only support competition rather than return patronage.

I will NOT use and recommend not using UPS when ordering anything. Not to say FEDEX is any better but there are other delivery companies available and they will succeed until they run into the same issues - it is a cycle.

Unfortunately UPS cannot afford to alienate their customers - it is the little guy that keeps them going!!!!"
The drivers don’t read I am convinced. Out neighborhood delivered are constantly going to the wrong address we should be paid for delivering mail that is how bad it is. UPS need to get people that can read and care to make sure we received our packages. 2 years and still doing the same crap and getting worse.
The ups have The beds drivers 170718 not good i do not want him to com to my dogs home
"They damaged multiple packages. I filed a damage report, and the process was extremely frustrating. I was transferred to multiple departments that had no idea what was going on. I wouldn't dare file another damage report or use this company again.

I even tried to speak with corporate or customer service agents so I wouldn't not need to leave a bad review, but that was a dead end. So I am now here complaining on the internet, and no one from UPS will ever read this. great."
"What I have to say is my opinion, I live in North Georgia, and this is relevant to any review. UPS proves to us every day we're getting closer to a third world country. Their level of incompetence is appalling. Their level of disrespect is shameful. UPS IMO is the worst delivery service on the planet, there isn't any wonder other major online retainers have expensed and developed their own delivery systems. UPS should be ashamed of the careless damage they cause during product handling of the American consumers purchases. Shame on you UPS. If you can't handle the load don't take on the load."
"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever had. Got a text at 11:56 that my package ""couldn't be delivered"". I called customer service at 12:08 to find out what happened. They said that they will have someone else from their customer service team reach out to me to remedy the issue. They call me at 1:19 pm to tell me that they couldn't help me and I'll have to call customer service. I called customer service again. Had to tell the robot my tracking number and when I finally got a person I had to tell them my tracking number again and be told that they can't do anything and that they will deliver the package tomorrow. The problem is that the delivery driver didn't even bother to ring the doorbell. It's like all they did was show up and put the note on the door. Somehow their laziness has become my problem."
"So, I wouldn't even give them 1 star for my experience. They apparently do not even care that perishables are sent. Sent a 2-day delivery. Package arrived and sat in their shipping center from Friday and now it is 5 days and still no delivery. I honestly will use FedEx or USPS going forward."
"Had an appointment with a local UPS store in Fayetteville, Arkansas to have a document notarized. Drove twenty miles and when I got there the young behind the counter told me that they no longer had a notary public working there. She was very unconcerned and offered no alternative to help me."
"I was sat in all day waiting for a delivery when I received an email saying ""sorry we missed you"" I was shocked as i'd not heard the door nor seen anybody. I checked the email and it said it had been attempted just five minutes ago when I was in fact sat in living room with a view out to the road and front door.

I checked my cctv to be certain and they had not been yet the tracker states a delivery was attempted. I do not appreciate being lied to or made to feel that it was in some way my fault that I have not received my package. When I tried to contact them on the phone or find a webchat I was just deflected by virtual bots. Pathetic."
"Just took 5 calls and over a month to find out my package was considered “abandoned” so had to involve sender to get permission to deliver it to me. $37 shipping (3 t shirts) then $36 brokerage fee!!!!!
Beyond rip off and just a racket"
My package is stuck at their Facility since past week. Been out for delivery for two Days. Never been delivered. Goes back to facility ans keeps being delayed to the next Day. Called customer service and they dont give a f***. They gave me attitude because I filed a claim with the sender.
"I have already written to the manufacture of my order to change shipping carriers. 1) The UPS delivery driver did not knock on my door nor ring my doorbell & wrote ""Smogster"" on my paper which the police, yes the police had to get involved to get my package, anyways the police couldn't understand why it even went to ""Smogster"" when the UPS store is closer to me. 2) UPS put ""Smogster"" tag over my name & never emailed me a new tracking number making it impossible to get my package & only through the police could I get the package. 3) There customer service sucks by telling me wrong information on (800) 833 - 9943 which is their phone number for the tracking number & customer service. Also the main 800 number sucks too because you can't get customer service & there website sucks because they wouldn't let me file a claim. Overall do not do any buisness with them whatsoever!"
Package keeps getting delayed. Never had this issue with other mail couriers. I will stop ordering from stores who use UPS.
I have generally had good to decent service when a package is domestic. But NEVER use them for an international package. They just can't seem to get it thru customs timely. I'm still waiting on an order from India that I ordered exactly 1 month ago. Another order from the same company that came by DHL got to me in 7 days.
"UPS lost my packages and promised to reroute the packages back to me but in transit the driver ended up dropping off at a random facility in another state. This caused issues with the sellers as well as me therefore losing thousands of dollars worth of merchandise that I am now responsible for, when UPS lost the packages. I have been on the phone with UPS the last month and a half to receive any status and what they can do to assist. It has been one of the worst and most terrible experiences I have ever gone through with a company who promises they put the customer first. After multiple calls, issuing multiple claims - they promised a reimbursement check via claims to be mailed out. AGAIN - they sent the check to the wrong seller and cannot even support nor help me find where the check was sent or when! Just the worst company I have ever worked with - and now I am thousands of dollars out of pocket restating the issue over and over again via, claims, email, phone with UPS every week."
Package is already 2 days late.suposed to be here by 4:30pm .it's 5pm and still no Package. They charge outrageous prices.ups sucks...
"GREAT CUSTOMER (NO) SERVICE UPS - Like many people, I would give a 0 star if available. Sent a package from Phoenix AZ to my wife in Calif. and I sent it overnight. Dropped package on Sat and was to arrive on the following Tues. After paying $190.00 for overnight of a 15 pound package figuring how could UPS screw this up.....well it left Phoenix but didn't quite make to Calif.....however this package in on a cross country tour of America. It arrived in Brooklyn NY on Mon....not quite Calif but it's close. Instead of a 400 mile (1) hour trip, it made a 2500 mile 5 hour trip. Now UPS does not even know when this package will arrive (if ever). I paid off overnight because this must arrive in Calif by Tues afternoon, any later no one will be at that location for a week + and it will be sitting on a doorstep that whole time....or until a porch pirate steals it. I don't think I have ever had this problem with UPS before, but this one really takes the cake for SCREWUPS. This will log almost 6000 miles before it gets to where it was suppose to go, if it makes it to LAX or goes on to somewhere else (I should air miles on my card for this one). The customer (NO) service is totally worthless! can't or won't help you with any of this, their response is the just wait and see approach. $190.00 down the drain, for that price I could have driven it there myself, even with the high gas prices, and got it there and got back in less than 24 hours, instead of 3-4 days."
"If I could give zero I would. I paid a lot of money for a simple return of important documents. UPS lost my package which caused huge personal problems as the contents were incredibly important. Since then, they refuse to speak to me about a claim and tell me to speak to the store. The store is very unhelpful and claim that the main UPS office won't speak to them. I've sent many dozens of emails with no resolution because they very rarely even reply. At one point early, they made an offer of compensation which was considerably less than what I even paid them, so they are literally stealing my money since they now have a system that won't allow me to speak to anyone to pursue a claim. Hands down the worst service I've ever received by any company ever (and I've had some bad experiences). Disgusting, purely disgusting."
Awaiting a refund now for 9 months. Emails are either ignored or response doesn’t answer my queries. Currently on phone on hold for 2 hours waiting to actually speak to someone to get this resolved. I’ll never use ups again.
"Absolutely the worst carrier available. I shipped a package from Texas to Mexico. Not only did UPS lose the package of legal documents, they charged me $150 more for the shipping. Next I had to ship a package to NYC before a client left the country. At the last minute without explanation, UPS changed the delivery date AFTER the client had left NY for her trip. I only use FEDEX now"
Ups delivered two packages and the 3rd pkg the same week they want to say my address is incorrect. This isn't the first time either. Never have a problem with FedEx and dhl. At one time Amazon got involved after that it was delivered. The only reason I used ups cause the site I ordered from only uses them. If they have other options I would use them even if it was a day longer to get here at least my pkg would show up. I'll just have to stop ordering from sites that only use ups. No I dnt want to go pick it up from your warehouse 20 min away I payed for delivery. They are the only place it looks like they play soccer with your packages.
"They mark it as they sent it and then steal the item. Happen twice, I was home both times, f..k UPS."
"Please do not place the package next to the sidewalk or a few feet from the sidewalk. The delivery guy didn't bother to open the gate, he just tossed the package over the fence. What if someone steals it. Why is it hard to walk a few feet more and drop it off next to the house? I saw the whole thing on my camera. A guy across the street was staring at the UPS guy drop it off. Luckily the package didn't get stolen."
"They are just as bad as fedex
Looking for a delivery today. They said delivery failed. If you don't attempt to deliver, how can that be?"
"UPS is terrible. Customer service is terrible. I sent perishable goods on the fastest possible service and paid an enormous amount of money to make sure it gets to its destination as quickly as possible. I even indicated that they were perishables. UPS delayed the package for 4 whole days with no reason whatsoever given. The receiver even offered to go pick it up at their warehouse but no luck. The goods went bad when they finally delivered it. Painful but no problem. I then tried to get a refund of my shipping costs and the money spent on the goods, that was another battle. I kept getting transferred and getting the run around. Worst possible service I have ever experienced."
lately ups been dropping the ball big time choosing sides this will be the last time thanks ......if you have a choice use other services even usps
We order something from Arkansas it was supposed to be 3day ship ups sent to Omaha Ne on the day it was supposed to be delivered and then they sent it to sioux falls SD and sent it back to Omaha Ne for delivery the next day it was out and there driver never knocked on are door we have camres showing what he did called customer support they said they would have it out Saturday called them Saturday again asking why is it still showing there drop place for Monday they suck well not ever have then deliverer anything again
"I have a long history of both shipping from work and personal using UPS for the last 20 years. This company has completely gone downhill recently. Over the last six months I have had more problems with deliveries being delayed, excuses, and poor customer service. Even the delivery people seem to purposely throw your package like they want to break it. If you have any option to use another company, avoid UPS. Maybe they can get their act together one day but I will never use this company again if I can help it."
"Where's the negative stars button? UPS is abysmal! You guys suck from pickup at the location to the time you drop off - if the package makes it.

Lemme tell you about your customer care 800 number - what a pile of dung. 100% automated and you can't even talk to a rep, probably because they don't exist.
Don't bother calling if you have a problem. Just hope your package isn't lost or stolen.

Your delivery drivers are illiterate and incompetent. The address on my package was spot on yet your driver insisted it was wrong. Even though I verified, it still took two extra days to deliver. But F me if I want to talk to someone to track down the problem, right?!

My five year old son could run UPS better than the 3rd rate dimwit executive staff and management could. Save your money folks and go to USPS or FedEx. UPS is dead!!!"
"A joke of a service waited all day for new phone nothing arrived told address needs updating street number wrong.
We do not have a number only farm name we are the only people with our post code even Hermes came to us today."
"In not so short, I paid UPS to pick up a parcel in Scotland and have it delivered to myself in the South of England, the item was my own and it was a bright fluorescent yellow bag, the size of a large ruck sack, not exactly an easy thing to lose, (in fact its designed to be found on the open sea) but lose it they did. Well that’s not technically true, they picked it up, lost it, started an investigation, found it, sent me a picture of my one of a kind item, gave me a delivery date, lost it again, gaslighted me by telling me they never found it and then chucked me fifty quid for my nearly 800 pound item. Because ladies and gentleman and everything in between, that is the ridiculous level of almost non-existent liability a courier has (look it up, I was shocked after my incident – imagine if you went to a restaurant, ordered some food and then had to pay extra for insurance in case the restaurant poisons you, because they aren’t liable if they serve you undercooked or gone off food, that’s the level of liability delivery companies are able to operate on – its criminal). I understood none of this when I used them, more fool me. You might be thinking why didn’t he take out insurance? Because when I pay nearly two hundred pounds for a service that simply involves picking up an item (that’s a bright fluorescent yellow bag) and taking it somewhere else I assume the company I’m paying for such service has insurance (now having researched the frankly criminal nature of delivery services, I was indeed a victim of my own naivety). If the petrol cost of the trip is over fifty pounds, it actually makes financial sense for them to ‘lose’ your item.

You can tell my obvious gripe is that UPS lost my parcel, a bright fluorescent yellow bag, whose contents were not exactly cheap. But what I find worse is their customer service, they initiated an investigation to find my item, which took nearly two weeks, they then found my item and communicated that to me, with a picture! Imagine my delight seeing my unmistakable bag on a shelf, proof of life, hope returned to my shrivelling heart. After a few days I grew worried about the lack of an update and contacted them asking when can I expect delivery. I was told that the investigation had closed and unfortunately they couldn’t find my parcel, I replied with “but you sent me a picture of it on a shelf”, I was met with the customer service equivalent of ‘computer says no’. I elected for a different tact, using the image’s metadata I found the type of handheld camera that was used to take it as well as the date and time, now given that everyone has smart phones these days, only a UPS employee conducting, oh I don’t know, some sort of investigation would be using a decade old handheld digital camera. I now wanted to know who took this picture, because I get gaslighted by enough women in my life to take it lying down from UPS, again I was met with ‘computer says no’. I am inclined to believe that it doesn’t, it’s just easier to not find my item then it is to actually genuinely find a bright yellow, fluorescent bag – I mean it’s not like it’s a cardboard box amongst hundreds of other cardboard boxes like a scene out of Indiana Jones, the only location aid it lacks is a flashing light!

I’ve been burnt and learnt a life lesson, I would implore you to learn from my mistake and use another company, literally any company rather than these people, none of them are great, but UPS is definitively the worst of the lot. They might deign to write a scripted reply to this review, sending me down customer service holes that I have already been down, but I can tell you after months of experience, it is just trying to give you, dear reader, the impression that they will do something about this loss, they won’t, because it doesn’t make financial sense for them to actually do anything – and that is their entire business model."
"This is the worst parcel delivery service you can use. Item was supposed to be delivered a week ago. I then get the late day notification that it will be delivered in a week (they broke the item). It was on schedule to be delivered yesterday and I get the notification that they attempted to deliver, but no one was available to sign. All lies, no attempt to deliver was made. I work from home. After throwing a fit, I get a phone call stating that the driver was on his way back. He never showed, and I got yet another failed delivery attempt email. This company is pure garbage."
The UPS is even worse than Yodel and Hermes.
UPS is HANDS DOWN the WORST company i have EVER shopped with. I ordered chelsea boots from the USA shipping to France. I had to wait 4 months until i received a message saying that they had lost my package. Furthermore i had to pay a TAX fee of 176 euros which i was forced to pay regardless of wether i received my package or not. So i payed. I then asked for them to send another (i had ti pay for another pair of shoes) and then on top of that again another 180 euros for shipping through UPS. All in all i paid 400 euros for shipping only. Stupid company don’t ever EVER shop with them.
I don't think any ups package was actually ever delivered to my door. Despite being home on announced delivery days as well as my phone number having been given. Instead it's always being sent to some obscure pickup point a lot further away.
Fast shipping great job fastest shipping seem to be in state sales
"It’s the worst delivery company I’ve ever shipped with
They charge me for delivery $153 then
They charge me to receive the item $154.65
& item never been delivered since June 16 2022
Never again"
"Why does anyone use this appalling company? Following my earlier review in which I lambasted them for terrible service and zero customer care, I now add that they managed to smash the item they were entrusted with - a unique and valuable stone sculpture. As the sender, who had carefully packaged the item, remarked, it must have taken considerable effort to damage it. UPS is a disgusting and disgraceful business. Read all the reviews."
I extremely dislike UPS delivery service because at first the time estimate for my delivery was 10am-12pm then it was changed to 7pm and now it’s 9:30pm and still no delivery of my package.
1Z14V49EA809621995 How do you lose an 80lb package the size of a full size bicycle?
"I ordered a12 packs of air filters
It shows that it has been delivered but I have not received it"
I went for interview for delivery driver the supervisor August 3rd 2022 told me I'm not in my 20's and will work like a robot. Because I'm in my early 40's and a couple pounds overweight that I wouldn't make the job.Youhave to able to lift 150 pound packages by yourself with no help. Only 1 person out of 10 Is employees will make their full 90 days. Before the interview they made me get a driver's abstract which costs $12. Regardless if they're gonna hire you or not You need it for the interview.
"Little lies, lies and damned lies. We paid $400 to ship perishables overnight. UPS claims ""the shipper"" failed to deliver our package to UPS until the following day. Our receipt says the ""the shipper"" is UPS. Next lie: ""We are very sorry.""

No more UPS, here we come Fed Ex."
"🤬THE ABSOLUTE WORSE. THEY NEED TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. I paid to have a package expedited, when I checked the status it stated the receiver requested to have the package picked up which consists of a debit card. I never made that request. I have been a victim of fraud. I contacted UPS five times. One person told me there was nothing I can do. The other four told me I would receive a call. That was four hours ago. I will file a claim for the $15 to have my package expedited. Why would I pay to drive far from my home to pick it up. I hate UPS and wish businesses would stop using them. Always an issue with deliveries even before the pandemic. Few of the drivers are thieves. They deserve no stars."
"My package was shipped back, after calling in for a week to verify that I do not live in an apt. A driver comes by here delivering to the school. You can’t make me have an apt# if I live in a house, called 5 days to tell you that even spoke to manager promised it would be delivered. Poor customer service and delivery services."
Their customer service are absolutely no help. They won't give you any extra information towards your package once it's lost. UPS do BETTER!
"I only put 1 star because I had to, in order to be able to write this review. In truth, they have 0 stars. UPS is a terrible service. I was having a package delivered to my home, many time as I've had before, and they are saying they can't find my house, that the street number is wrong; so they couldn't deliver my package. The street number was correct. They are the ones in error, but they didn't attempt re-delivery. The just returned my package to sender."
"Placed a flat screen on its side, both sides of the screen were shattered! 😡 looked like it had been dropped on both ends 😡
If I could leave a negative amount of stars I would 😡"
If I could give no stars I would. Paid extra for express shipping from. GERMANY. Tracking stated it arrived ten days later but I never actually received the package. Still trying to get this resolved over 20 phone calls later. Worst customer service and worst delivery company. Unreliable and false advertising. Avoid at all costs
"Very unreliable and liars, I order a lot online, I always receive the parcel processed by other carries.
I have never ever received any shipment sent to my with UPS, delivery attempt failed, and put the parcel for pickup at a location that is 2 km away from my that has no direct transportation connection.
And they do not even leave a paper at the door or in the mail box saying this, I only know about it from Amazon, which means they do not even bother to come by.
I even called customer support, they do not care for this, it seems a general UPS policy."
"The adress (which is good) is required… What the hell do you want ? Deliver my parcel, please !"
"I have a package that I can’t wait for ,,because I work !!!! I call the customer service to see if they can leave it at a ups location near me ….they said for a fee of 7.99 soooooo I can pick up my package I gotta pay them this is a garbage company I wish fedex would of had my order 😡"
"We have had four ‘delivery attempts’, as UPS put it… We were home all four times, and no one came to our door. The package has to have a signature for delivery, so we made sure to be here and keep an eye out for them. I always put all of our information, our gate code and where to deliver the package on my delivery instructions with the order, and also I have a membership with UPS and I have those instructions listed there. One of these attempts, I was able to track the driver who stayed in the same area for about four hours, and then finally got moving and drove past our house, turned around, and then drove at a high rate of speed past our property. We watched it. I also have screenshots of the tracking map that says ‘in your area almost there’.
No notices have been left either.
They also leave packages with extremely expensive and life saving medicine outside our gate on the ground in any weather and sometimes out of sight and my husband has gone without the meds due to this and that could end his life. And the meds are not supposed to be left in the heat or extreme cold or they’ll be toxic. It’s extremely stressful living with the fact that a lazy liar UPS driver has my husbands life in his irresponsible hands and can get away with murder if he so chooses not to bother doing his job. But that’s the case and we’re being forced to be in a life threatening situation every single month.
I’ve reported this problem 3 times now. They don’t give a damn. The drivers do as they please and decide who lives or dies. But if their actions kill my husband they’ll give a damn then.
The rest of my day will be dedicated to installing a camera at the entrance to our property. And, in the days going forward, most likely contacting a lawyer."
"I created a return pickup on Amazon. I had the package ready to go. I waited inside all day yesterday, and most of the day today. But no pickup.

This means my kids have been stuck inside waiting for this pickup, on their summer vacation.

I decided to cancel the return at lunchtime, and send it myself, at my own expense.

Today at 2pm there was a very quiet knock at the door. It was the UPS man for the pickup. I told him, sorry, I just canceled it. He looked upset.

I asked, why didn't you come yesterday, as that was the next business day, as specified in the return. He said, ""We did, this is the third attempt"". How they managed three attempts in two business days boggles the mind, because that IS NOT what they said they would do on the return information. They said they would try for three successive days. But apparently they changed the rules and tried to pickup twice in one day.

I said, ""I was here the whole time with my kids. We didn't go anywhere, and the kids haven't been able to go anywhere on their summer vacation, because we've been waiting for you. If you knocked as quietly as you did today, no wonder nobody heard you. Why didn't you just ring the doorbell like everybody else?""

He ignored me and walked away."
"UPS at 1110 SW 93rd Ct. Rd. 34481 allowed 15 customers to wait while both UPS reps assisted people who brought their packages not packaged for mailing. Of course these customers need to be helped but not at the expense of the other many customers who only needed a code scanned, a receipt provided and they could be on the way. Poor management!!!!"
"UPS are so unbelievably bad it is bewildering how they are even still in business. i would have given zero if I could. I am still waiting for a package which has been in the UK a week with all taxes etc paid. THey are impossible to get hold of, with no UK phone staff and an avoidance policy which means you never get to talk to anyone in charge. The actual 'tracking' system is beyond a joke. Avoid at all costs."
"Dont use this company, they never deliver on what they promiss they say they will be there within a 4 hours window, so you sit and wait for those 4 hours for them not to show up, and they cant even be bortherd to inform you about it and if you check the website after your 4 hours wait it just say they will come by the end of the day....so now they dont even have a clue when they will get here i mean worst delivery company out there please use anything else to send your items."
So I have bought a ynot ticket nearly 3 weeks ago and it has came today even though ynot was last weekend I am very disappointed and the customer service was very rude as well I will not be using ups ever again never known anything like this hope your ashamed at yourself hope this company will go down hill
The worst delivery service I’ve ever experienced! Unbelievably poor service.
"This company is a SCAM!
This company is a SCAM!! I paid a lot of money for two day delivery from Brazil to Spain. I paid for two days delivery guarantee and it arrived after three weeks!!! Now I'm not able to apply for refund because I didn't received any invoice and they don't want to provide one !!!!!"
I am so mad I could scream. For 4 years we have been sending our close to Sturgis and this year they left our box with all of mine and my husbands cloths at the wrong house and it got stolen. All of our cloths!!! It had instruction in big black letter where to put the box. Can they not read addresses or words now. Very pissed and will definitely tell everyone to never use UPS !!!!!
"Absolutely unreliable, so many times disappointed that I’m avoiding this company like fire, unfortunately some firms use for online delivery and than you a customer is the one who take the stress."
For the second time in 2 months UPS has failed to deliver a package that they show out for delivery. This has happened two days in a row now as the driver pulled up in front of my building went to the back of his truck got back in the driver's seat and left never attempting deliver. FYI the access code and release authorization we're both provided and I've been at this address for 12 years and no problem until the last few months.
"I always get excellent service at the UPS store on 1227 Rockbridge Rd SW, Suite 208, Stone Mountain, Ga 30087. Today Iftake helped me and he was exceptional!!!"
I send a shipment from China to Morocco with ups by air … cost me $350 they said it will take 3 days .. it’s been 3 weeks
This has been the most frustrating experience I've ever had with a courier. UPS Worst International courier service in India to consgn – 1ZR8EZZ00416638280 sent on 16-06-2022 to Portugal through Overseas. The UPS in India was charging more than the package’s amount and they did not deliver my package to Portugal and they are return in India on 28-07-2022. Do not ship items internationally though UPS they do not help deliver. They only demand twice or thrice the package amount. I will sent our parcell on Rs 6479 and return charges is Rs 77084 + Rs 8700 ( Custom Charges )
"Horrible, they can’t help at all."
"UPS are the worst delivery courier I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

I had a parcel which was sent via 'Express Delivery,' I would hate to see their normal delivery service! The first delivery was delayed due to a 'late flight,' (Friday 06.00 it was scanned into Castle Donnington and so it was rescheduled for Monday, bearing in mind UPS deliver on a Saturday! So they could have delivered Saturday.

Monday it stated ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Monday."" Monday came and no delivery!

Tuesday it stated ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Tuesday."" Tuesday came and no delivery!

Wednesday it stated ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Wednesday."" Wednesday came and no delivery!

Thursday it stated ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Thursday."" Thursday came and no delivery!

Friday it stated ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Friday."" Friday came and no delivery!

Now I have just had another email saying ""your parcel is on its way and will be delivered at 12.00 Monday.""

The parcel has had a status of import scan at around 21.00 hrs every day and the parcel has never left Castle Donnington since it arrived nine days ago.

This is not the first problem I have had with UPS. I've had parcel delivered before from TomTom and the Sat Nav was fully soaked in water. The shipping carton was crushed and soaked.

How companies are still using these people, I will never know! Such an incompetent company and still in business.

Just be warned, if you are thinking of using UPS and you need your item quickly, I would look elsewhere.

If I could give zero stars, I would. They don't even deserve one star!"
"They are so bad and don't let them get hold of your credit card details. They quote me an amount to courier a parcel and when they finally did delivery it a week late, they almost double the cost and just debit my credit card without any explanation. Trying to get the invoice out of them or why they just added the cost is absolutely useless."
"Horrible Customer service and unreliable app/website.

I been waiting for a package for the entire day and even tried using the app tracking the delivery but have yet to receive my package. the ""promise"" to have it delivered by 7pm is Total BS and right now is almost 8pm and I have not received the package. I did manage to talk to my local UPS driver and he checked his truck and didn't had my package in his vehicle and said could ""possibly"" be delivered until Monday.

New employer send me time sensitive materials and was advice by ""customer service"" could ""possibly"" be delivered by Monday but has no guarantees or timeframes.

I would never recommend UPS to anybody nor any future employers or business"
so I have made purchases from 2 different stores that were lost by the UPS delivery guy in my area the first one was $1000 when I called the store report that I hadn't gotten it they said that UPS had already delivered it and where ever he left it the people were kind enough to bring it to my house otherwise I woul have lost the merchandise I had ordered and the other one was with Costco same sutuation UPS confirmed that they had delivered the package to my house o don't know what their empoyees are on or if they are stealing the packages or what but they got to fix that ongoing problem if it was up to me I would not use their services at all they suck and their service is horrible.
"I loved UPS in the past, but it is now intentionally throttling deliveries. I paid extra to have a computer delivered on a Thursday after I ordered it. It then got delayed to the next business day, which is… MONDAY? It’s now Saturday, and the package still has a status of being processed at my local facility. A couple months ago, the packages were delivered to me the same day they were processed at this distribution center. I’ve had six packages delayed five or more days now."
"Frequent problems. The latest case, the deliverer noted that I ""rejected"" receiveing the package. I was not at home at the time! Previously I had been charged for deliveries that should not be registered as such, among other minor things."
"I paid for overnight delivery. Tracking information said that it was on the way as scheduled. The package never arrived. Called customer service. NOT ONE SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE COULD HELP ME!! They absolutely could not track exactly where my package was. They said it was on the vehicle with the driver. Obviously, it was not! Why do I even bother paying them? I should pay them when my package arrives on time, as promised. If not, they get nothing!"
"Ups should be struck off! the worst delivery company out there! They have no consideration for people's parcels at all! They are always delivered broken, dented, and damaged! What an appalling service which includes the horrible bad mannerd people they employ!!!"
"They stealing people hard earn money package, scumbags."
"Delivered via this company my computer from home to another address, was 2 packages in one delivery (monitor and PC). Monitor was delivered kinda fast, for PC they had every day new reason why it's not delivered yet during 1 week with every day contact support via email/phone. After that, they delivered my package with PC. Box was opened, they tried to steal expensive components, but don't know how to extract them and literally smashed them (even metal broken inside). Carton box and computer case without any damage. Don't trust this company. Never send any package. Support not answering for this problem, contact support after track code just hangs up the call instantly. All happened in Czech UPS."
"I am writing to you for the third time about the delivery of my package which has not yet delivered after almost a month, my friend who has to receive the package has also paid customs clearance fees, he always calls your customer service every single day, and witch one is your answer always same thing, they deliver it tomorrow do not worry, they deliver it tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, a month has passed but still nothing. I have never seen such a thing in my life, this is called the mafia and yes you are the delivery mafia and you took my package hostage, I spent 80 pounds to ship it and my friend paid another 40 euros in tax , I'm really pissed about your attitude, you have to deliver my package !!!!!!!! this is the third time I am writing to you, your service literally sucks, it is I hope that your company fails, now as usual a robot will answer me, customer service not existent ......... you have to deliver the my package, change driver, change general manager, you are really incompetent"
They are horrible lost my sons important paperwork they didn’t even bring to my door to sign was signed by the driver and left in my hub box and nothing was in there
They skipped my house. My package was due on Friday. I have ups tracker. They dropped off my neighbors package but not mine. I'm never using them again.
Driver according to the map where you can see where vehicle is .. was at same place for over 2 solid hours around lunch !! My package was suppose to be here by 2:30 .. now it’s after 5pm and still just driving around in circles not doing anything .. waste of my time waiting on this fool !!!
"I received an email the day before my scheduled delivery giving me a delivery window of 1:45-5:45pm. I took the afternoon off work so I could be there for the whole 4-hour window, then received an email the morning of my scheduled delivery saying that there was a failed delivery attempt at 8:20am. I called UPS customer service and spoke to a representative, explained what happened, and notified him that I did not receive a call or any other notification that the driver was outside. He said he was passing my message onto the driver and I would be contacted at 2:20pm about rescheduling. By 4:20pm, I had still not been contacted, so I called again, waited on hold, was disconnected, called again, waited on hold again, and eventually spoke to a live agent. This agent told me that the window specified in the email I'd received was only an anticipated delivery window but drivers can show up outside that window. I told her that this information was not included anywhere in the email. She signed me up for the tracking program alerts and told me that no one would call, that I should just listen for a knock at the door. I told her that I live on the 6th floor of a brownstone; I am not going to hear a knock at the door. She told me to track the driver's location on the app, which I am skeptical will even be updated in real time. This whole experience felt like a giant ""screw you, we could care less about your time"" from UPS, who I will not be using in the future."
"Could be the worst company I've ever dealt with.. I ordered a $200 item from the US to Canada and paid $46 for shipping. When the item arrived I was told that there was an additional $107 brokerage fee for them to give it to me. The fee breaks down to $27 HST (customs tax) and then the remaining free ($80) is pocketed by UPS, in addition to the shipping fee that they were originally paid. That an additional 32%. I have no idea how this is legal..

I've been told that there is a way around this where you 'self clear' your package though CBSA, which I can now trying to do. However UPS needs to send you a commercial invoice to proceed. I've called and spoken on the phone with four different ups employees in the last day or so, the first two said that would be emailed to me in 2 hours, and the other two employees said it takes 24hrs.. to send an email... It's now been well over 24 hrs and I'm still waiting. I've emailed several times as well.

This is crazy and UPS is really asking for another class action lawsuit."
"Complete liars and unreliable. I was expecting a package and followed up on the delivery date and time, waited all day only to track it and get a message saying the driver attempted to deliver my package and will redeliver the following day."
"I called at 10am and scheduled a pick up july 28,2022 for no later than 3pm no one showed called back at 4pm they stated by 7 pm again no one showed to pick up package horrible horrible service"
Worst package delivery every. Super late. They lost my package and will not open an investigation without me doing something on my end. I refuse. They messed up. They can fix it. Going to be messing with them daily until its fixed.
Would give 0 stars if possible. This company has lost tons of my deliveries and the item I shipped with them via the 2-day option literally hasn't arrived 6 days later. Utterly useless! Don't get me started on their painfully annoying customer service
"They literally are not delivering to your door. They drop it in a shop 20 minutes far from where I live, despite that I work in home office and I'm always home. When I mentioned this in the shop for the delivery guy he made up countless reasons that I'm the one to blame. Also, he did not even leave a notification, so good thing I checked myself otherwise they would have sent it back to the sender. Don't trust these guys, criminal company"
They delayed my package for days with no excuse and they didnt even say they were sorry. Never using ups again!!!!!
"Arrived a day late with no information/explanation, and the box was completely torn and gaping open. Luckily the contents weren't particularly fragile but if they were they would have been ruined."
Like most others I'm getting complete garbage service. Ordered a 3D printer from china from a reputable firm and paid over £200 for expedited delivery. Two weeks later it's still in Hong Kong and all I get on the tracking is one delay after another. Useless completely useless.
"Do not trust UPS delivering your package. These drivers either steal the package or they deliver it at the wrong address. I have security cameras that show UPS never came on my property 7/27/2022 neither did anyone esle. But they say my $1,200 iPhone was delivered at my front door. UPS you have been busted. Security cameras don’t lie."
"❌❌❌They lie as like breathe
Unreliable company I Can’t recommend this
I am curious how accurate your times or your respect for the customer?
We did not come to beg from you and you not deliver free shipping we want you to offer an excellent shipping for our money.I will do everything I can to avoid your company."
"At 2:21 PM on Thursday July 21 I ordered a 128GB iPhone 13 mini for my wife from Apple. It was in stock and it was supposed to be delivered on the following day, Friday, July 22. UPS picked it up from Apple in Chicago on Friday at 9:22 AM. We live in downtown Chicago. You'd think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you'd be wrong.

We didn't get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn't get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either.

On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: ""Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE."" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There's a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That's very interesting. What happened? We'd love to know more.

We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they'd deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn't. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won't let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn't tell us anything. We weren't the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient.

On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn't.

Today it's Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven't heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that ""the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible."" Apparently it wasn't possible on Tuesday. It wasn't possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it's still not possible today.

Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don't you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn't able to locate it? Can't track it with some global-corporate equivalent of the ""FindMy"" app technology that works so well to track my son and my wife? UPS can't locate it either? Somebody doesn't know how to scan a bar code? The dog ate the paper? The driver got sick? ""It fell off the truck""?

I guess it serves us right for trusting Apple and UPS that $923.56 would be enough to make them do their job. We should have walked to the Apple Store and picked it up in person. It's only half an hour walk away. But we got Covid ten days ago. We're still recovering. We ought to be patient. So we're whiling away our time on the web and on the phone. We ought to get paid for this! It's hard work.

Like I said: FUBAR!"
"I've had problems with courier service in the past, but this is so far the worst. How can this company be still a thing??"
"Ordered home delivery, UPS didn't deliver. They left the package further away in one of their access points, claiming ""the recipient could not be reached"" - straight up lying, as I spent the entire day home waiting. Do better please."
"It's been 3 days that I've been waiting for my package, I had to call 4 times, they updated my contact informations each time, the truck driver passed in my street in front of my wife without stopping..."
Drivers pick up parcels with no waybill.Parcels go missing.Driver cnt account.Customer call center not helpful at all.The biggest thief's in courier services.
"How can any shop still use this company for deliveries? Look at the average rate! Since they tend to answer the reviews, let's see what they say this time. What is the use of answering reviews or even emails or phone calls when they don't deliver the items? Is it that what is really happening is my parcel is lost or has been stollen? Why they keep telling me stories about the ""small change of address"" and that they ""understand my frustration"" but the status of the order still doesn't give me a delivery date? That doesn't make any sense. Another weekend coming with no delivery again I suppose.... Just hypocrisy apologising and doing nothing and more and more of the same."
"UPS offers NO assistance for customers with tracking numbers that start with ""1Z."" They let you know the day the package is due that it's been delayed and a new delivery date will sent ASAP. That's BS. They leave you hanging because the package is now in the hands of the USPS. If UPS can't finish what they start and show more dedication to customer service, they should either increase their fleet or close their doors. It's been 9 hours since I was notified of the delay, and I can't be provided any info as to where my package is or when it's due. Just delayed. I'll NEVER use UPS again."
My wife is stage 4 cancer and depends on a specialist pharmacy Optum to provide the chemo drug the only source to treat her advanced cancer each day delay is significant. We have waited 5 days for an overnight delivery and hope we get it tomorrow.
I tried to explain to UPS that no one would be home when they try to attempt another delivery tomorrow. So therefore no one could sign for it and there was no way for me to sign for the package over the phone or through my account. I asked him to hold it at their main hub where the package would be spending the night. The lady told me she would have to charge me $7.99 to hold my package. I told her would you rather it go on delivery truck waste gas hurt our environment and waste the delivery van drivers time. Her response was yes they will attempt another delivery tomorrow knowing I would not be there. I will do my best effort never to use UPS again out of the pure incompetency.
"Delivered on time as always by pleasant, courteous delivery people."
"Have been given expected delivery for parcel every day since the 22nd, no parcel has arrived. Contacted customer services via email, no reply, contacted customer services by phone, told would be delivered on day of the call, surprise surprise no parcel. Was given a phone number for a UPS broker who is apparently managing customs for the delivery, permanently engaged! As others have said, if I could give 0 stars I would, avoid UPS."
Package was lost or stolen by UPS. Started an “investigation” that has been going on for about 3 weeks. In the meantime I had to reorder item and am on the hook for $300+ for the first item. UPS sends me to vendor and vendor says they are waiting on UPS. Doesn’t seem like it would be that difficult. If I could rate UPS lower I would.
"Absolute garbage. Never on time, like to hide information, copy and paste excuses. Overtaken Royal Mail as the worst courier going."
"The absolute worst parcel company in existence. I wish they would stop accepting my packages from retailers so that another parcel delivery company can do the job. Packages never arrive, and if they do they’ll be left in a whole different location then my address."
"Terrible service, terrible customer service.

It's now been 2 weeks since I used an ""overnight"" UPS courier (read: paid an arm and a leg) to send something from the Netherlands to the UK. Not only has it still not arrived, they have no idea where it is.

I've literally spent hours on the phone with their customer ""service"" trying to come to a resolution. Each time I'm told something different by someone who is barely understandable as English certainly isn't their 1st language let alone their 2nd.

Every time I'm told an investigation will be started...

Avoid this company at all costs"
"Less than a month after my previous encounter. UPS are excelling at incompetence again.
Receiving a parcel from Europe UPS called and email to request my DOB and a licence number. The item in the parcel required neither of these, as such a challenge why I was being required to provide this. UPS responded it was a customs request. I again challenged that the item in the parcel was not needed, and requested the contact number for HRMC or the legislation that stipulated this requirement. UPS did nether instead give me a number for the UPS switchboard, with no direction on what area I should contact.
I contacted HRMC direct and confirmed that my DOB or licence was not required for this item. After this, I again challenged UPS and sent them an HRMC response and a link to the item in the box. almost 2 weeks after this I have had no response. The parcel has not yet progressed on the tracker, nothing.
The worrying part of this is I was told there would be an £18 charge every day past 3 days for storage until I provided this information, yet the staff at UPS could not provide me with any evidence that I was required to provide this information. In addition to this, the agency that controls this licnce information requested could be approached and they would provide all the infomation needed, as would the suppier of my item. Jet UPS staff had no idea why they were asking for this information."
"I can take the late notices as annoying as they can be on some things but not an overnight live animal (coral) that I could have driven there faster than a UPS overnight delivery that only had to move about 400 miles. UPS claims their truck broke down in Phoenix coming to Prescott, they left the coral out long enough in the heat that it arrived the next day dead and stinking and well past the morning delivery time."
"Said I would receive package on 26th. Didn't come 26th. Then it said I would I receive package on 27th. didn't receive it on 27th.

Any service that plays games like this with its customers is bound to lose popularity and die out. UPS already is rare in our neighborhood as it was replaced by a more diligent and assiduous USPS that never failed to deliver our package like this."
"I’ve broke my glasses two weeks ago, so I’ve ordered one and paid extra to have it shipped as soon as they done making them, everything was going as plan, the delivery day was assigned last Friday July 22nd, but didn’t happened, reason that the distribution center didn’t put it on the truck to be delivered that day, and they said it will be delivered the first business day which happened to be Monday July 25 before 4:15 pm, , it’s ok Monday will be ok, at 3:35 pm that day the UPS truck drove by my house and didn’t stop, so i called, customer service said that the business where the package going to be delivered was closed and they will try again the next day, hold on what business , this is a house address, my house, so I’ve explained that to him he said a manager will call me before 7 pm, well no phone call from anyone, but Tuesday July 26th the manager called me at 9 am, she assured me my package is in the truck and i will get my glasses no later than 4pm, nothing no package, so again i called customer service, same answer, a manager will call you before 7pm, nothing again, no phone call whatsoever, its now 10 pm on Tuesday night and still don’t have any information about my glasses. All i need is for someone to tell me exactly without empty promises when will I be expecting my glasses. Can anyone help me???????"
It's such a bad and awful service. My package was lost in transit and no one from UPS inform me. I had to contact the store myself. I always have a bad experience with this f.. company
"Absolutely the worst company to ever ship anything from. Received a computer shipment from my friend and the computer was damaged heavily inside and due to some shock during transit, some internal parts fell off and the heat sink ended up being thrown around inside leaving metal scratches and dents. Seems like the box was thrown around (Damages on the box with puncture marks). I did send an email and discussed and provided them pictures for the case/claim.

They offered the $100 as compensation back, they did not honor it. They also completely ignore any follow ups in regards to the claim.

Stay away. They don't deserve your business."
"This company must have internal thievery taking place. Here's what happened: package with products ordered from Amazon was sent to Millersville, MD, then Baltimore, MD, then Kentucky, and then Texas. Um? That's where Amazon was unable to track after that. Package apparently ""lost"". In the meantime, on the named delivery date of July 23, 2022, ""someone"" logged into the UPS system and claimed I requested to pick up package in Millersville. Huh? I was out of the country and didn't have internet access, and I have never interrupted my packages in transit before. I have filed a complaint with UPS as well as Amazon. This company doesn't even earn 1 star with me."
Horrible customer service. No one seems to know where packages are and why they are not arriving. Just awful.
"I must say every UPS driver that has delivered my package went above and beyond assisting with my package
making sure that I receive it. They even ring my doorbell to make sure the package is in my hands they are five star when it comes to great customer service.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👏"
"Do yourself a favour and stay away from shipping with UPS. I was shipping a package from The Netherlands to Dubai, to myself, since I moved there. Dropped off the package at a UPS center, they emailed me asking further details, I replied the next day, they said sorry too late, the package went back to the shipper, which is me, but unfortunately already in Dubai. Asked them to take it a friend's address. They did, but leaving the package outside of an apartment building, ringing the bell and leaving. My friend saw no one and move on, since it happens that neighbours ring to open. Hours later he takes the garbage out and finds the package. Unfortunately everything inside was heavily damaged. You'd need to run it over with a forklift to do such damage. I've been spending several hours with the customer support now, only to figure out why I can't submit a claim online. The portal keeps returning an error when I try to submit it (hmmm. magic, right?). This whole thing is just terrible and I don't know if I'll ever see a reimbursement or anything. WORST shipment company, really."
"Very poor delivery experience in France. If you have an alternative delivery option, it is better to try that."
Ups is a joke! I had two packages order from the same place same time with next day air. One delivered one did not. Called ups she assured me the second package would be at my home tonight. As soon as I got off the phone the delivery time changed to next day. Called ups again and suddenly there is nothing they can do but deliver it tomorrow even though I was assured it would be today! I’m sick of people not doing their dang jobs! I wish I could have left ZERO stars because they don’t deserve even one!!!
I am surprised how companies use UPS to deliver their customers' orders. UPS deserves 00.00 start rating.
Keep losing packages and say they cant locate it. Well I can see exactly where it was delivered but UPS cant. How hard is it to carry boxes and scan for the correct address? Its 25% of the shipments too. You know how hard and useless making a claim too with UPS? I would not recommend having a business account with UPS.
"Horrendous. It seems like every time I have a delivery scheduled, the driver zooms on by without stopping, then reports that I wasn't home to receive the package. If I try to reschedule for another day on which I will be home, they want to charge me $10! Outrageous!

Not only that, but they seem to have fired all their customer service employees. It is no longer possible to get them on the phone or even an online chat.

Remember how much OnTrac used to suck before they went out of business? They were a dream compared to modern-day UPS.

Twenty years ago, UPS was a good company. Now they suck donkey balls."
"Excellent, fast and friendly service!
UPS at 207 Bank Street."
Horrible. The website is not allowing me to file a claim for my damaged items. I have $540 worth of damaged items that needs to be reimbursed from shipping through UPS. Never in my life have I see boxes so beat up and thrashed other than the delivery of these boxes. Items were falling out of the boxes as they were being delivered. It is impossible to get a hold of customer service even though I have tried through various methods.
"Ups lost a very important package I sent. I have spent weeks trying to go thru their claim garbage. Today they told me after speaking to six people that package is lost, they won't look anymore. They said they would email me refund forms instead they sent be a link to file a claim. For a billion dollar company the have the worst customer service ( all foreigners) and just give you the run around in hopes you give up and they don't have to payout the insurance claim."
"I have no computer except my smartphone, and have no printer. Many times I've brought online returns to the UPS Store in Holden, MA. When I show the free return shipping label on my phone, I've been told that they have no way to print the label from my phone. ""We don't have a printer that works."" I got the same response 3 other times since then.
Today, I called the store first, and explained that I have no way of printing the label. After dodging my question, I asked, ""Do you have a printer or scanner to make the return label?"" This time I was told there's a charge if I don't print it at home and use my own tape to affix it. Really?...$4?
By the dodgy attitude, it would seem that they get this reaction from all customers. He also told me that if I brought the box to the store, he could better assess if my free-shipping online label from Ralph Lauren would cost me extra. I won't drive 9 miles again, only to pay $4 to print a label, and more $ to affix it to the box. I've read reviews that say the exact same thing. I know, as a customer service expert, that 98% of people who are disserviced will not write bad reviews when they have legitimately been disserviced. They just pay to avoid the hassle of going elsewhere. Do yourself a favor by going somewhere else to start with. I've found out that this upchrage is policy at all UPS Stores. If you must use UPS, schedule a free at-home pick up. The label will be scanned from your phone, and be delivered with no charges. I'd say, use the US Postal Service, or FedEx, but I know for those who buy from Amazon, there's an exclusive contract with UPS. Imagine the money they make on unsuspecting Amazon customers who go to UPS, thinking they can just have their phone scanned for free. It sounds like a very LUCRATIVE business agreement. Some might say collusion, but you decide for yourself."
Worst service.never deliver on time all the time reachedule delivery
My order arrived to a different place than where it was meant to so I had to go looking for the parcel from several shops.. I hope ups will get better in this.
"they service and call center/customer service is the worst. they phones ring off the hook, and when they do pick up , they get cut off and they cant even make feedback calls. absolutely pathetic"
"Package not delivered, returned to sender. Driver noted no apartment number. I don’t live in an apartment. Called and was told it is my responsibility to log onto UPS site and request a notification if something is wrong. They are not responsible. Although this was their error there was nothing they could do since it is being processed to return to sender. Bottom customer service."
"Horrible was told my package is scheduled for delivery on Saturday between 2pm n 7pm took off work early to come because it required a signature package never arrived, checked the app and noticed it's rescheduled for Monday without any notification from UPS even though I signed up to receive to notification from them, and customer service is clueless and no help keep repeating the same thing over n over again...."
"They were supposed to leave a package, but required a signature anyway. Then told me that it would be available for ME to pick up the next delivery date (Saturday) at a CVS pharmacy, but it wasn't there. When I called the customer service line (after the call screener hung up on me twice!) , I was told that my package won't be available for me to pick up until Monday.
Absolute garbage"
Customer service is useless. Spoke to two people but didnt answer questions effectively and didnt solve problems at all. They said the driver attempted twice but i didnt even get contacted. (I did provide full address and buzzer code). Also spam was calling multiple times so apparently the info was leaked to scammers. The organization did a terrible job for designing the system and everything. Ridiculous!
"I wish there is zero stars. I ordered online clothing, and I was supposed to get my parcel on Tuesday. I live in an apartment and have a suite number. They never called they arrived, I also gave them a buzz code too. They didn't give any notification that they attempted delivery. I called them on Wed, and customer service told me that I will get it by EOD on wed, no one came to deliver, and no communication.

Pathetic service.

So now, I started not ordering clothing from that brand anymore, not because the clothing brand is not good, but just because UPS is not good at delivering parcels on time."
Just an awful service. My package delayed for a week because of the shi*ty system. Support is almost unreachable. Would leave negative stars if it was possible
"Today I am cancelling my plans against my better judgement optimistically hoping that UPS will eventually deliver my package. My optimism is based on a fourth email informing me of a 4 hour delivery window which on the previous three occaisions they have failed to fulfill promised delivery. After the third attempt I called the helpline which I suspect, judging by the accent of the operator, was in the Phillipines.
The answer to my question: Where is my package? I was told it was in Germany, the next logical question: Why am I receiving email notifications of a pending delivery the astonoshing answer was ""ignore them they are automatically generated"". What is the point? This is a sham of an organisation which is following the more common trend of absolutely zero customer service and failure to 'deliver', no pun intended, on their core business.
Fingers crossed for me which I suspect will be my best hope of UPS actually fulfilling there promises."
"If I could I would leave negative stars... They lost an irreplaceable gift my husband bought for me. The company no longer makes them and was going back and forth with them since March. It is now end of July.... They finally admitted that they lost the package. It was in my state then poof, gone. I'm heartbroken and so very angry. I don't understand how something just disappears off the face of the earth and apparently it's very common. What the hell are these workers doing?! It's infuriating"
Terrible company it took them 10 days to deliver my skateboard.
I'm so tired of being given a delivery date then at the last moment my delivery date change. I'm so sick of these delivery services. I pray I can give up ordering anything online.
"Lost 20% of my shipment, then lost half of the replacement items. Total joke"
"Purchased something from a seller on EBAY, rare expensive (heavy) piece of equipment, have before and after pictures of the item. They sent me a letter effectively saying ""Too bad, so sad"". So I paid $80 for them to break a piece of equipment for me. nice"
So my more expensive package is fine to throw on the ground outside my apt. But the one worth less that I paid for faster shipping (that didn't happen cuz UPS is actually incompetent) you decide not to deliver because I wasn't there? Maybe if you had delivered it on time I would have.
Every time I get something sent through UPS it either comes two days later I get bogus notifications that the delivery was attempted. This is the worst service out here they don't care they figure it's us or somebody else and right now that ain't really no one else besides the post office. No one gets fired unless they show up high or drunk.
I will never use UPS. They use an automated answering service to answer calls. It is impossible to speak to a representative. The driver did not ring my bell. I had put up a sign requesting that packages not be left in the hallway. Horrible service!!!
Every now and then the delivery driver drops off my parcels to a collection point instead of trying to deliver my order to my address.
"UPS not only did not deliver our next day air package at all, but they closed the investigation to search for it with no stated reason after 2 days though every agent continued to say it will take up to 8 days. What's worse is that the contents of our package are 3 passports and with their non-recovery and UPS' lack of effort or dedication of resources to locate it they are acting irresponsible and unhelpful at every turn. Our identities being stolen is at stake and no one takes responsibility to help secure them. Customer service does not help. Every request to speak to a supervisor leaves us with a ringing phone which continues for 15, 30, 45 minutes and longer with no one answering. This caused us to miss our flights and has now cost us nearly $10,000 in mostly non-refundable expenses....and an agent only offers a refund of the $51 cost for shipping. It's disgraceful and demeaning."
"Excellent delivery service. Kept informed and, when I knew I couldn’t be there for the advised delivery, it was so easy to change and the revised delivery date/time worked exactly to plan."
I have used UPS for deliveries from Germany for many years. The service has been 100% excellent. Always helpful customer service.
"I am very disappointed with the service UPS provided during my last shipment. In the past their service was on point. Apparently, this time my package has mysteriously gone missing. I wouldn't have mind so much if this was a regular shipment. However, this shipment was for an occasion on this Saturday. Now on top of working my fingers to the bone for 20 hours I have to give a refund. I actually could have just driven the package myself if I had known all this was gonna happen. The staff showing no compassion is another thing that's bothering me. I was provided a phone number that no one has answered in 3 days. That's called the ""run around"". Thanks UPS!"
My package never arrived so I called UPS customer support. No human answered and the virtual assistant refused to connect to a representative as I didn't have tracking number. It refused to continue the c conversation and hung up. There's no way to speak to a human when you have a delivery issue.
I have been waiting on my package since 6:30 this morning I’m very upset about this situation my order was supposed to be here by 7:00 and here it is now 7:46 and I don’t have my items this very upsetting to me as a customers
"UPS, always leave my packages outside in the open in front of the huge sign that says all package go inside. Every other delivery service puts my packages inside except UPS. I think UPS IS the worse delivery company,"
i am handicapped but that doesnt mean anything to ups. i had 2 50-60 pound boxes arriving soon so i told the front desk i want ups to bring my boxes direct to my door but ups refused to do that and they simply dumped the boxes in the lobby. ups has no concern for handicapped people or at least the drivers in my area. i complained to ups and they said someone would respond but no one ever did respond after 5 plus days. now one of those 50-60 pound boxes i want to return. i told ups the box is in front of the door and they need to bring the return label and days later they never show up. it is my address on the box but they insist on me bringing the box to the lobby even though i am handicapped. a ups driver will do what is most convenient for them.it is dissapointing that ups wont help and my box sits in front of my door for days. i will try to call the local news since reporting this to ups does nothing.
UPS has my package in my city for the past 3 days. They mark it out for delivery and that it’ll be there by 9pm but then 9pm passes and it shows it was taken to the carrier facility. I ordered this off of Amazon and my address and information has always been the same. To make things worse I can’t even speak to an actual person from UPS. Every time I have an issue with a package it’s because they went through UPS.
"This the worst service as you can see their ratings.
Just go to fedex or other agent that provides delivery service.
Especially don’t send anything to Ethiopia even paper. Because there are conflicts between USA and Ethiopia they’ll take your product legally. That’s my advice."
Really Bad service ...they lose my package 3 time and they dont care. ..they never on time always stupid delay ...if only i can give 0 star ...they dont deserve 1 star....this compani should be out of the game ...Ups its the worst carrier service
If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst shipping company ever. Lose my package on the delivery day? Ya ok there. Do not use this sh!t service
Email received from UPS saying delivery 11am-3pmon 15th July. Eventually came at 11am on 18th July withour further notification.
"In the period May-July 2022 three of my UPS shipments from Turin, Italy were opened and the contents stolen. The packages arrived empty.
It happened in the period between the courier's pickup and the first scan at the departure location since according to the courier's investigation the weight at departure and arrival was the same, too light to hold the type of item I have sent.
In one case, the wrapping paper with which I had wrapped the package had been removed and replaced with a UPS envelope.
This nice little game caused me an economic damage of 820 euros.
There is an ongoing complaint."
"The worst user experience and service I've ever had to deal with! Home delivery confirmation text asks to choose between delivery to collection point (reply with 1) or home delivery (2 with door code after) and everytime I get parcels that are heavy sent to the collection point despite me saying I want the parcel to be delivered home. Not once not twice but all the time. So frustrating. Their mobile app is just the worse in the same frustrating way! It tells you to create an account, when you do you have to register to UPS my choice when you go there it asks for an email you either give the same email and it shows an error or you give another email and it redirects you to the same view. WORST DELIVERY SERVICE EVER"
"Ordered furniture. Email sent with tracking number. Went to track shipment and it said the package was delivered to my home at 9:52 am. Called store and they confirmed it was delivered outside my garage. I had been home all day. Looked outside ,nothing by garage door. I told the store there is nothing by the garage. They repeated it has been delivered. Call UPS ! I called UPS, got an automated voice telling me shipment was delivered this morning. Went outside looked around. Nothing by my garage or my neighbors in the cul de sac. Decided to drive around the neighborhood. Saw 3 huge boxes stacked outside a garage. Parked and walked up to the boxes. They had my name and address on them. Rang the doorbell. Person came to the door and I explained those were my boxes. She said she called UPS to come and pick up the boxes because they were left at the wrong address and no one called her back. It was starting to get dark. Called UPS to speak with a person. Automated person said no one was available. I called a person with a truck and ask to come to my house and bring a friens. We agreed on a price. They arrived 45 minutes later. We went to the home. They said each of these boxes weigh at least 70 pounds and you would never been able to lift them. They placed all 3 boxes in the truck and delivered them to my home. I called customer service at UPS. Don't feel I should pay twice for having an item delivered. I haven't gotten a response from UPS yet. Terrible customer service !!!"
Worth service ever. Customer service is a disaster. I will never use UPS again.
"Everytime ups deliver, my package is damage and its always 2 to 3 days delay. Everytime, all the time!!!!!"
"I have been trying to receive a package for a week now. It requires a signature. The first time UPS tried to leave, no one was home. They left a slip to sign so it could be left at their next delivery attempt. I signed, and they still did not leave the package at the second attempt. After the first failed delivery, I had also went onto My Choice and said to deliver with a neighbor across the street (this option was offered on their website). At the second delivery attempt, not only did they not leave my package, but they didn't attempt to deliver to the neighbor either. When I try to call in to speak to someone, it's an automated system that hardly accepts the number choices I push, it's like pulling teeth trying to get to a live person, and when I do get to a live person, none of them are American and are hard to understand. They keep repeating the same things and not answering my questions. Most people are not home during the day because they work, and can't sit at home for hours waiting to sign for a package. The only option they left me after 2 failed delivery attempts was to pick up my package at a local service center, which is out of my way. And not only do I have to use my expensive gas to drive there, but I have to pay a fee just to pick up!"
"I scheduled a pickup, and mentioned that I don't have a shipping label ready. The driver came and told me that's not acceptable and left without another word. I called UPS right away, and the customer service representative (who know how much attempt I tried to get to a live person to talk to) told me over the phone the driver has manual labels, but I have to ask. How am I suppose to know I NEED TO ASK after I clearly said I don't have a label!
Then the representative told me the driver will come for another attempt for free on the next business day. This turned out to be a lie. So next day, I called in the morning to confirm this, and another representative (who knows how many times I tried again) told me that was a lie. She said: if you believe in the first representative, you can just wait for the driver. At the end I was shocked to found even the system asked you to stay online for a survey was a lie...."
"Ordered from Target. At time of order the estimated delivery date was Sunday. On Friday I received a email from UPS telling me my package would arrive on Saturday. Since I’ve experienced this before I figured it would arrive on Sunday, as stated by target. It’s Sunday at 3:30pm. No package. Find tracking number and it states shipping label generated, I will receive email with date. I don’t care if it comes latter, just pissed that I got an email stating it would be here early. Like, why?"
My package was supposed to be here the 15th and it’s the 17. It’s says I have an invalid address and I checked and it’s the right address. I tried to call them and got a robot that told me the exact thing I already knew that hung up on me and wasn’t helpful at all
"Contacted ups office for shredding services. First they offered first pound of paper free.later the office on first avenue near 6 st was contacted and was ask if the I could the actual shredding, and they said yes. They did not accept the ups offer and you have to leave papers with them. Ups website said one thing and they just want your email.you be the judge."
"UPS is the WORST carrier service. They don’t answer calls, they let your packages fail delivery attempts without letting you know why, they hang up on you. Any business that uses UPS might be doing alright but will ultimately FAIL."
Showed latest delivery for Friday at 7pm. Took off off work since it required a signature. Never showed. Spoke to 2 customer service agents that promised by 8pm. No show. Turns out never scanned in. Horrible service!!!! No issues with Amazon or Fedex. What happened to UPS?
"UPS doesn’t even deserve 1 star. The worst delivery company ever, nothing else to say other than that."
"DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICES. They are the worst, the most incompetent delivery service ever. Charged you for a service, misplace packages, dont honor their services. They do not take any responsibility for anything. Even the usps work way better than these clowns excuse of a business. The incompetence is at another level. Paid over 140 dollars to deliver a package to Puerto Rico and they sent it to Philadelphia. Can not even read or tell the difference between a single letter."
"Never deliver to your home, leave in package point directly. What a shiiiit service from USA company."
"If I could give zero stars, I would. I've been waiting all morning for a package because it requires a signature. Imagine my surprise when I get an email stating ""delivery attempted, rescheduled for next business day"". Uh, what? You absolutely did NOT attempt to deliver, I've been looking for the UPS truck ALL MORNING. This is absolutely unacceptable. The only thing I can imagine is that the driver didn't want to get wet as it's raining here this morning. Your only job is to deliver packages and you somehow find a way to expand the boundaries of incompetence. Absolutely unacceptable, I'll never use UPS ever again."
"If they don't wanna to do their job please quit, nobody force them to do what they feel annoying to do. I asked him to leave the packages in the basement but he refused to do it. Okay that is fine but don't show his attitude to me that I didn't even do anything wrong to him. Just quit your job if you dislike your job and that is all."
"Very bad services
A friend of mine sent me stuff from nigeria,Ups didn't even tell me why they are sending it back after 15DAYS,not a call from them,the things are not country-ban after paying huge amount of money to get it shipped to italy and the tracker indicated it IN their warehouse,I called them they could not explain to me why my parcel IS been sent back
It's a very annoying experience and I will never use UPS again"
"It doesn't seem to matter what people write here; many still continue using UPS.
Absolutely the worst customer service on the planet; that is not the fault of the workers but the people that organize the customer service policies and telephone menus.
I just spent over an hour trying to pay my bill. Take my money, please! Sorry, we will have to transfer you to another department."
"They are always late. Their customer service agents hands are tied because of poor company policies, so if you need anything from them, it's going to be hard if not impossible. They leave you guessing when anythingvwil be delivered, because it's never within the time window. I would expect this kind of perfessionalism from a drug addict or a mentally challenged relative. If I have a choice, I WILL NEVER US UPS!"
"I have experienced the worst courier service with UPS. I paid $50 for their express service on top of $30 custom fee. They mentioned product will be delivered in one business day. However it has been 4 days now, product hasnt been delivered. Every day they provide me with a new ETA, mentioning it will be delivered next day. I called their customer service. Their lack of professionalism and incompetency surprised me. They had no clue what is going on. I saw on ups tracking app my product is one of the nearest Warrhouse from my home. I asked them if i can go pick it up if they cant deliver. They replied it need to be approved and i have to wait then few more days. I then ask for supervisor. They transferred me to another agent. Then she started telling me that she doesn’t know how long it will take for me to receive my product. I again ask for supervisor. She told me that their supervisor is busy and will call me back when she is available within an hour. I have not received a call back. I haven’t had this experience with any courier service. I paid the highest amount for this service and cant get a straight answer. It seems like all agents are just dodging my question. I would not use their service again if they dont resolve this issue. Amount of disrespect i have endured from using their service is unacceptable. All they tell you for their mistake is “sorry” and “not sure.”. I would not use their service again and not recommend them to anyone in future."
Parcel had been opened to see the contents and not revealed . It was then left in the open in an unsafe place. No way to lodge a complaint unless you sign up to their service and enter quite a lot of details at which time you are inundated with messages unrelated to anything but spam. Overall a very disappointing service.
Honestly had super low expectations due to prior experience with postal service losing or saying idk where the mail is when it was something important in question. I missed a package being delivered and UPS not only told me when the next delivery day and time were but actually kept their word. A very happy customer here! Keep up the good work!
"Am not at all impressed with UPS Delivery service. This time it was left at a neighbours door down the road , was lucky last delivery never appeared"
Only giving one star because zero stars is not an option. Don’t bother trying to call them because the automated system will not allow you to speak with a person. It hung up on me 4 times after trying to check the status of a phone call they promised and never made to me.
This is by far the worst customer service there is and that’s because there isn’t any!!!! I cannot talk to a human to save life on earth. The robot will not allow me to talk to a person!
"I have a mailbox at a UPS store in Nevada. The first time they attempted to forward a batch of my mail via 2 day express to Washington, the package got lost in the system because the system did not like the receiving address, an RV park that gets packages all the time. My UPS store tried to call UPS central help and change the address after almost a week went by (since I was no longer at the original location anymore) which should have fixed the issue. But then the package still just sat in limbo in the system again for another week. The tracking data never changed no matter who called or reported the issue. Even the UPS store people couldn't get past the central UPS help line place they call for help. They said it is an international call center not even in the USA. It's been two weeks and all I can do is wait again to see if the package has been lost or stolen, UPS can't even say where the package was last seen. Unbelievable, don't ever use UPS to ship anything, even if it's from one of their own stores!"
"UNPROFESSIONAL PARCEL SERVICE.

LATE. ALWAYS.

UPS IS A RATS BACKSIDE OF A SERVICE AND DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL. PARCEL WAS STUCK IN JAPAN FOR 60 DAYS DUE TO A MECHANICAL FAILURE AND MY CUSTOMERS WANTED REFUNDS.

POOR PARTNER. NEVER AGAIN."
"Their customer service is ridiculous you can never speak to a actual person, and their drivers are a joke they send you links saying that they attempted to deliver a package when there was no stick note left and I was at home all day. If I could give a 0 I would."
"UPS is the worst. They don't care at all, the customer support is terrible and I regret every single time I choose UPS."
"> Write detailed instructions how to find the delivery address and spend the whole day at home.

""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery"""
Dreadful service from UPS taking over a week to deliver 5 parcels from Germany and we have still not received them even though we have received emails advising that they will be delivered on a particular day - have been advised this is not the case from UPS! Their web site is riduculous and talking to one of their operatives still gets nothing resolved! Being passed around and having to advise your details repeatedly. Will never use UPS to deliver or collect goods on our behalf! Every delivery we have from UPS is always delayed.
"I've now had three delivery dates from UPS, only to wait in and have nothing arrive. UPS's tracking site is back to saying they'll give me another date 'as soon as possible.' It's shambolic service and they don't have a clue when or if my parcel will be delivered. For the supplier who's using them, why would I order from you again?"
"Never had a problem with ups. Always on time, never lost a package. Not like a fedex"
"Absolutely garbage! Every time UPS is used for deliveries, they hold the package and request the delivery address, even though they already have the address. It is my belief that this is done as a tactic to give the depot extra time to arrange the delivery. Very poor management in the Philippines. I dont know why the global management team doesnt take action and dismiss the whole management team responsible for such poor performance."
"I’d give no stars if I could. I ordered books 105 dollars worth and it was shipped in a single box. I was home all day and it was due today. I get the email saying it was delivered at 129pm and got the email at 350. No one knocked or rang the doorbell. I go look and no package! I checked it, yep says my package should be here. Nope! I have to file a claim cause the phone number reminds you five times the customer service can’t open a claim. WHat are they there for? I try to do a claim online, make my account and they want a payment method???? Are you kidding me? So I can’t make a claim unless you have my card info? I paid shipping when I ordered so no you aren’t getting my info. So I can’t file online and their customer service via phone can’t help me either???? So now I got to wait two more days to contact seller again to see what they can do for me. This company is horrible and I will not be ordering books online again since they use UPS for delivery. All these complaints this company should be reported and shut down."
"I supposed to get a parcel from COSTCO on June 21, 2022. Somehow the driver left on the main entrance of the building a note about my parcel. The driver did not buzz the Intercom to let me know that he is here. I was home waiting to get this parcel and after about one hour I went to the lobby and I noticed that he left that notice on the main entrance of the door. I phoned them many times and their customer service promised to re-deliver the parcel Today is July 13 and despite that I phoned them every time I heard all kind of excuses. At the end they invited me to go an pick up my parcel. What a nice joke. They supposed to deliver the parcel to my place and here they are asking me to pick up my parcel. Perhaps this is their new strategy, to ask people to pick up their parcel as they are .... perhaps sleeping. What kind of company is UPS ? They have no respect and appreciation for their customers. What a shame. I will phone COSTCO and suggest not to use UPS anymore for their services. I have many other tenants in my building having the same issue with UPS. They should hire honest people, not people who are cheating and lying. I will never use UPS and I will inform all my friends about UPS lack of respect for their customers. John"
UPS IS FULL OF SH**! THEIR DRIVER CAME DOWN A VERY SMALLL STREET AND HIT MY CAR! THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR DRIVER HITTING MY CAR! I AM PISSED OFF!
UPS used to be a premier service. Not anymore. When I order from an online vendor and see it is being shipped by UPS I cringed. Ordered something from Amazon that was to be here Tuesday. Then they say Wednesday but it still says “label created”. Vendors should have to report who the ship with so you can avoid them.
"Their packages never arrive on time. You don’t receive updates on time. The day of supposed delivery you always receive an update saying you package is delay and no reasons of the delay. Once my package was literally on my city and they says was delay for a storm and there wasn’t any storm. The package arrived 5 days late. Recently I bought a package that was split in 2, one was sent with UPS and other with USPS, the one with USPS, was received on time, still waiting for UPS to receive an update with reasons of the delay. Worst delivery company."
"Due to UPS’ anti-gun stance, I will never ship with them again!"
"Horrible service. They steal packagers or lose them. Rude workers. Literally everytime I order And it is shipped with ups, my package gets lost. Literally everytime. Thieves"
Lost my business by threatening to destroy personal packages of guns parts. Even to fix a gun you own. It's against the law they know it and now the wanna violate our constitution by refusing to do their job that we the people keep them in business for
"I paid for 2 day shipping from Australia and then the parcel tracking shows it sitting in the UPS warehouse for 5 days saying they have contacted me and awaiting a reply. No one had contacted me, I rang them many times trying to get someone to help. Dreadful experience."
"Worst.. don't ever go with 3 day shipping.
Have paid around $450 for it, but got delivery after an 10 days without refund."
BUYER BEWARE......Recently purchased 12rd magazine before the July 1st mag sale ban in WA state and UPS delivered a empty package! Checked my security cameras and the only other people at my house was me so UPS either lost or stole my item! Contacted both UPS and PSA and was basically told to pound sand! Will never buy from or recommend a company like this again and now I'm stuck shopping for 10 Rd mags awesome. Thanks UPS and PSA!!!!
I pacificately requested for my packages to be delivered to my front door. The ups man put my packages on the hood of a car in the yard. He constantly set my packages out in the yard somewhere. He is so pitifully lazy.
"these scumbags did not even call me.
fragile and temperature regulated medical package.

from Holland to paris 6 hours drive.
put house number and apartment number together. no wonder cannot find.
they just don't give a fuk.

65 euros wasted plus 120 euros medical hormones"
Your company is the worst and your employees are stupid the whole company needs to be thrown the away your works only listen to respond and not listening to understand and respond. From the 22 of June and the package can’t deliver and everyday is another bs.
"Ups is the WORST courier service, the delivery drivers don't give 2 craps about your package. My package was left outside of apt building and is now missing. An investigation was opened and then closed without any notification. I still have yet to receive my package or a refund. I had to call them 5times just to get the investigation reopened. I missed a whole day of work, in which they for damn sure are not going to compensate me on, and now I have to wait even longer for them to complete another investigation. And their automated system is straight trash, I had to call 4times just to get an actual person on the phone BC the automated system hung up on me whenever I asked for an agent or operator. If it were possible for me to choose my own courier I would never use ups."
"Very poor service. We are having to drive an hour to pick up our package. Our business was closed the day of delivery. Upon receiving the note, we called the UPS store. Was told to pickup to find out we have to go to Montgomery and pay a $7.99 pickup fee. The 1800 # is very difficult to understand, rude and did not resolve our issue! This is POOR and unacceptable customer service!!!"
"I would give 0 stars however it is not an option. UPS held my parcel in the same place in the UK for over a month and only contacted me at the end of the month to ask for more information (even though I had used Parcel Monkey and already given all details) and to let me know that they had been charging me money every day for holding my parcel. The emails sent to me and phone calls made by employees were so unprofessional that for a while I believed I was being scammed. When one of my parcels arrived battered and with a huge hole in the box, I was asked to pay £100 extra for the delivery on top of what I had already paid- still waiting on my suitcase just hope it arrives with my belongings inside at this point. UK UPS is a daylight robbery scam and if you want to receive your items in one piece within an appropriate time find a different service, not worth the stress or money."
"Hello, my name is Tony Bobet. I am waiting at house for a long time and no one came to bring me my package. The tracking number is 1Z9W58320332234644. The item that I am waiting is Typewriter. I don't know why they have a company if they don't deliver the package. Lucky, I didn't had a doctor appointment. I really be pissed off"
I Love type/talking to a computer when you trying to find your shipment!! They deliver customer service as well as they deliver the packages!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"UPS is by far the worst delivery system. Paid for over night shipping and for no reason at all it was delayed in UT. Now its says the estimated delivery won't be until 7 days later , and that's just the estimated delivery. Don't pay the extra money to have some thing over nighted when you can get it in the same amount of time for free. I will never use UPS again when there is by far better options."
"This company is so sh!t they made me go through all this sh!t to sign up with them to do anything then i do that give them my address i order something im waiting and waiting so i call because i get repetitive useless text from them then they're asking for apt number so i said i have an account with you with my address all over it my package tracking number is linked to my account all you had to do just look at my account and you would've seen my address they just chose to hold or not deliver my package if i didnt get frustrated and go to their website i wouldn't have known there was a problem and this guy on the phone barely speaks English and tried giving me attitude like im the idiot who didnt think to look at their record to see my full address on their site i HATE ups and this isnt the first time they did this last time i had to drive to their mississauga warehouse house to get my package or they were gonna send it back, the one time i forgot to tell the seller dont send my package with ups"
"The destroyed my shipment and refused ti give it to me. The have decided that the caps where lose and what I have in the box is a price of hardwood lol.

Not trust worthy at all. Then I call for 10 days in a row every time I get an answer. They refuse to send it back they refuse to have me pick it up!"
"I really feel bad about this review since not all UPS workers are unprofessional, I also feel bad for the owners I understand that's the best help they could find.

Honestly too many incompetent people working in the same company can't be real. Stop apologizing or blaming on covid since that does not affect your performance, stupidity is what's not letting you advance.

I don't know, I'm thinking and thinking and thinking and the only reasonable explanation I can find is that perhaps UPS managment puts some chemicals in the water or coffee that you guys drink thinking it will make you work harder but side effects are developing brain damage or some sort of condition on many of you

All I say here is true and verifiable, nothing more nothing less

June 29t, I contacted UPS Mexico via phone to advise me on how to ship International since it was my first time, I asked if any additional documents were needed besides the shipping label, I also asked if plastic wrap could be use instead of a box and the guy said yes to the plastic wrap and ""NOTHING"" else is needed other than creating a label. The guy said that all the information they need will be submitted once creating the label

Same day June 29th around 5pm UPS Mexico picked the package up going to the US.

Thursday 30th I received an email from UPS Monterrey Mexico requesting a commercial invoice for clearance, first issue with the information they originally provided about ""NOTHING is needed from me other than creating a label"" that same day after only 1 hour from their request for a commercial invoice they had it in their hands, I received an automated email first followed by someone from UPS Monterrey Mexico confirming as commercial invoice received, he also advise that the package was on the move, of curse I had to make many phone calls and go through many rude people in order to find the one guy willing to help.

(Quick advise: If you ever need to deal with Mexican companies including American companies operating in Mexico do not hurt customer service representative's feelings... I repeat, Do Not Hurt their feelings by sharing your frustration even in a respectful way or any other way because they will hang up on you or make your experience much more miserable than it already is, even if you try to report them nothing will happen or change.

July 1st they charged my credit card for almost $40 dollars extra on top of shipping cost and no one knows why or what the charge was for, again I had to waste hours on the phone trying to find out, UPS Customer Service in Mexico City blames UPS here in the States and here they blame UPS Mexico, what I know is that UPS Mexico is who made the charge and without my consent but as I said, UPS Call center in Mexico City has the worst customer support I've ever experience, I talked to 5 different people both, man and woman from that department and they all acted exactly the same rude way except for people in Monterrey Mexico where by the way my package was put on hold for a week, they were very communicative, I appreciate that.

Long story short, the delivery date has changed many times already but no package, their system shows package arrived in my City on July 9th and also shows today's date July 11th as the delivery date but then when I called them to verify why the package was not out for delivery someone told me that the package is lost, they said that tracking information shows that the package was scanned in my city but no physical package is available followed by America's favorite word when things go wrong ""WE APOLOGIZE"" on top of all the crap they have put me through they don't let me talk to someone with longer arms to find out what's going on, instead they want me to go online to file a claim.

They don't really deserve to have this many customers when they treat customers like crap.

I should've use FedEx instead but they were more expensive. You get for what you pay for"
"I paid an extra fee to have important papers sent to me via UPS. Waited. Had my cell phone on as the call box for entry to my bldg is connected to my cell phone. Got a text msg from UPS. ""Sorry we missed you."" Cked my phone log. NO PHONE CALL FROM THE CALL BOX. NOTHING.
Called the UPS ""customer servive""number."" Took a while to get to a human. She kept apologizing. That I wd be called back. Nope. No phone call at all. Just more infuriating texts.
If I cd have given a zero unstead of a one, I wd have."
"I have an international package which is expected to be delivered on 7th of July, but due to no proper communication from UPS package is delivered on 11th of July. We had a family function and package contains some mandatory items for function and occasion.

Trust pilot team, please have zero star rating as well in the rating section, I don't want to give one star also for UPS."
"They were unable to deliver to my apartment due to the cellular outage which is understandable. They rescheduled the delivery to a mini mart that closes earlier than their delivery times. I have no idea why they would do that when it can be redelivered to my apartment, especially since they rescheduled the delivery to a different day.
I called customer service to request the delivery to be changed to my address. He seemed so lost and confused by the request. I should have gotten the package days ago but due to their slow service it seems like it will take another week for me to get it."
"They treat fragile packages like trash
They treat fragile packages like trash. boxes were delivered demolished. Submitted a claim as the contents are worth 675.85 dollars total Terrible service."
"I will not explain, because they don’t care."
"UPS delivered 3 packages yesterday and put them on the ground out on the road by my mailbox. It had been raining all day. Found packages this morning. All 3 destroyed. Oh course there isn’t a complaint number you can call. Customer service was useless.
Was told I had to go online and file 3 separate forms and someone would call me to come by and take pics of boxes. Just leave them in the porch."
waited all day for my package to arrive. Then i saw a sorry we missed you label outside on my mailbox. did not knock or ring my buzzer outside. this company load up the driver so much that the driver need to cut corners to make it thru the day. This shipping company blows.
"The absolute pits. Driver pulls up on delivery date, looks for package, nothing delivered, drives off. Lazy people, don't care about time sensitive deliveries. If you call customer service, they'll connect you to a Chinese person who speaks poor English."
"I really don't understand why any reseller or online shop would choose to use the service of such horrible company... Time and time again their service has proved to be outrageously expansive and requiring so much work on the receiver's behalf. They leave the tax authorities paperwork for you, sending multitude of email messages, demanding information they can find themselves (like package sizes and communications with the sender which they are already paid for) - then inflect extra costs for the work they should have been doing for the original outrageously high price!"
"The driver simply didn’t want to deliver my package. No truck, no knock on the door, no slip left on my door or porch. It just went from (out for delivery) to (attempted delivery). Called UPS customer service, they said that the team in my area would call me and let me know whats up. Three hours no call, so i call back and finally someone said my package would be two days late and i can pick it up in two days. Very inconvenient, would have liked the truck to have just showed up and tried. Thankful for what the workers do for a living, but this experience was really not even one star worthy 😕"
"Don’t use ups if you don’t have to they suck never deliver on time 3 days in a row they said the receiver wasn’t home and I’ve been home all day no point in using the app I authorized the shipment release and left a note to leave in the garage, all three times they have failed and they make you pay to pick up at a facility"
I order regularly online and sometimes my sender use UPS ...sigh!!! Soo I decided to have UPS to just leave at my front door. Was suppose to receive a package a couple days ago 7-7-22. Of course I didn't receive the package ( was delivered to different address). I filed a claim and UPS says they can't do anything because I said leave at front door. :( They did not that but they are still apparently not liable. CHANGE YOUR CHOICE PACKAGES PEOPLE!!
They left my package on top of a row of mailboxs that could have gotten stolen and in the rain I left deliverey instructions to be left on porch! Then toyed to make several calls to complain to get intouch with Noone !
"I received notification that my package would be delivered by end-of-day. I took the day off from work and waited - it was never delivered. I called twice, but no one could tell me what happened, except that my order was in the warehouse and delivery had not been scheduled for another day. I was finally able to schedule the delivery for the following week. Two hours after I made those arrangements, the delivery came to my house. It was just lucky that I was home at the time to receive it, since I wasn't expecting it."
Where do I start? My company sent me a package to the hotel Im staying at. Apparently attempted to deliver three times but business was “closed”. I asked the front desk person who reminded me its a 24/7 location with someone manning front desk the entire time. Ups never even showed up or came by. Now I have to pay 7 dollars to pick it up because the driver is apparently incompetent to do his simple job. UPS is a joke. They are trash
"I've never had a pleasant experience with UPS delivering any package of importance. This time they didn't even attempt to deliver the package, they just left a note claiming attempted delivery of my $2000 package. I was home all day waiting on this. I went to the customer service center trying to somehow get my package out of the hostage situation that is a UPS delivery truck and was told a supervisor would call me to discuss options. I was called and told that my options were to have it held for pickup on Monday (today is Friday, so that's more than a full weekend without a very important package) or that it might go back out tomorrow. Obviously the delivery drivers can't figure out how to work a gate latch and walk to my front door to actually deliver the package so of course I'll have to pick up the package myself just like every other package that has been delivered through them."
They send my package to the wrong address over 1000 miles away and had to audacity to not give me information after the person charged my card and bought more things! What a stupid company
Wish I could just report what ever driver delivered my package a day late after scanning it delivered the night before. He also decided to open my package of Shoes from Nike.com and see what brand they were before bringing me my package. I’m annoyed because I spent my hard earned money on MY belongings for a worker to think they can just open and look at my sheeet. Check y’all workers please.
"1Z6559X42011126020.
UPS always fails to deliver domestic parcels at
the address. They always deliver to the pick up
point and it has happened with me time and again.
They do not realize that parcel may belong to old
and sick people without access to car. Delivery
instructions means nothing to them.
Moreover they always lie that attempted delivery
failed. Customer not available and similar excuses.
If given a choice would never opt for UPS.
Canada Post is much better option"
If I could give 0 stars I would. Next to impossible to get ahold of a representative. They don't help at all. They lose packages all the time and do not help to find the cause or apologize or reimburse. The people on the phones just tell you there is an investigation ongoing.
"If it would allow me to leave 0 stars I would. We paid for expedited shipping for our parcel to be delivered Wednesday, it never showed up. We were told it was on the truck and would be delivered Thursday, it never showed up. Friday my husband called customer service and was told they attempted delivery that morning but no one was home. BS, we were here all day, no one came to the door and there was no note left to say they had attempted delivery. Apparently (according to Customer Service) it was at the depot across town which was supposed to be open until 3pm. My husband drove across town and the depot was closed. When he called Customer Service yet again, they told him it hadn't even arrived in the city yet. What?? Worst service ever, would NOT recommend."
Complete joke of a company! Ordered meat overnight from Texas and it took over a week to arrive!! Obviously the meat was spoiled when it got here. Then trying to reach a customer rep to talk to is impossible. How this company stays in business is beyond my comprehension! Use FedX
My package was left at a neighbor's address and it was opened then they brought it to me. I talked with local supervisor who did not think it was that big a deal since I received it. 4 out of my last packages delivered by UPS have been delivered to the wrong address. Mailbox is marked with address and home also.
"Absolutely fu*king appalling!
If I could give zero stars, I would.
Waited over two weeks for a package, with no notices of any attempt of delivery, only to call call customer service and have them tell me it's been returned to sender.
What kind of bullsh*t is that??
Fix your company practices, your tracking and train your drivers better.
UPS is the worst."
Amateurs. Can't find the biggest student dorm in the entire city
i had a 4 hour delivery window in the middle of the day so that ruins your day to start with. the parcel wasn't delivered even though they said they tried to deliver it. it was taken to a collection point where i suspect it was taken from the start. i have asked for the parcel to be delivered to my address.
"Unhelpful, rude customer service. They don't care or resolve issues with their USPS contract. Order starts with UPS, then when USPS doesn't finish the delivery, they don't care or resolve it"
"I sent some valuable items with UPS, Fully insured. The driver ripped open the box damaging the contents. They were then lost, and it took two weeks for them to return the package to me, with no exclamation of what is happened.
I put in an insurance claim and was ignored for four months.
After numerous messages by myself, trying to find some resolution, I eventually received a letter saying that my packaging was insufficient, even though it was the UPS driver who damaged the contents and I am one of the leading specialist in sending these items abroad.
Dealing with UPS is like dealing with Con artists. My items have been ruined and I have lost a fortune. I've been treated dreadfully and have been caused great deal of stress distress"
Shocking company. An absolute joke. Phoned to pay import duty and they said invoice would be sent once payment made. 3 months of chasing and receiving automated message saying they would send it and still nothing. Then just for fun today they took payment twice. I think it may be easier for me just to report the theft. Worst company EVER
"UPS has admitted that they and sub contracted customer service representatives, both domestic and international, will at their discretion google a consumer and visit their website and the search does not add value to the relationship or transaction. It is not known, nor will they say what they do with the information and under what criteria a search can be conducted. This was confirmed by Scott Harris of the Atlanta office who is employed as a corporate customer relations manager. He agreed that upper management is aware and that I should not expect any communications from his boss Lonnie Perez operations manager, or her boss Steven Larsen. He was correct, as I e-mailed them, the CEO and several VP's and did not receive an answer.

I discovered this when I learned that the Philippine outsourced customer service group accessed my website as i was tracing a lot shipment. The customer service rep in the Philippine's has admitted to doing it and I have an e-mail from UPS stating their right ""
I will reiterate that there is not a policy that prohibits agents from accessing publicly-available records.""
UPS Corporate Customer Relations


They have demonstrated the right but not the need. They have refused to divulge why they do it, who does it, what they do with the information and how it helps to improve the UPS customer relationship.



I truly believe that when a consumer calls to trace a package, they do not expect to be investigated."
"UPS is the worst delivery company. Not only did they originally lose my package for three days after she shipper contacted them twice they finally found my package along with 8 other they lost then they delivered it to a address that I haven't lived at for three yrs and that I never put on the shipping address. Then when I call there ""customer service"" they tell me cus they messed up I have to pay more money and drive out of my way to get what I ordered."
"Now you have to call your boss and stay home all day waiting for a driver to show up.. Can't?? Then we can leave it at the pickup location for 7.99 next day.. wth is that?? I paid for the delivery already, just leave it at the ups store like always before.. No, we'll try to extract yet another few dollars from your wallet, found more ways to do it.. SHAMELESS .. SHAME ON YOU, UPS.. never ever use your service again .. people pay and you just take advantage of it.. all you do well is your daily price updates.. keep on, sky is no limit.. I ain't paying you another dime 👎👎"
Don’t use UPS at all better off going with fedex or a local company…UPS will not take care of what you ship and customer service is terribe
I called for 2 day straight to try and talk to someone at UPS about a lost package. I finally spoke to someone who told me I would be cvs likes back by a specific time and it never happened. I did a live chat and the agent was clueless. My package was shipped on June 15 and it’s now July 7 and they have no idea where it is. Why is it so hard to talk to someone at ups?
"If it was possible to give negative reviews i would!
UPS is so bad. They returned my package to the sender without notifying me and when i called to ask the customer service the woman was so rude to me saying she cant do anything about it.

Never use it!"
"Impossible to rectify a small error!
I had made a small typo in the address, this was impossible to change. Website continued to give technical glitch error (tried five times), no reply on email to customer service, seller mailed them but also got no reply, then I called twice - agent couldn't help and told me to call on the day of delivery. Could reach them then either, then the package was just put in a public hallway without any signature!"
Incredible service from this company. 2 days from ordering to delivery. 5 star rating. Top quality product and would highly recommend. Many thanks.
"I shipped a pair of glasses internationally from the US to the UK. The process and customer service was awful from the start. Essentially, a pair of glasses cost nearly 400 US dollars to ship and deliver. There was no contact information for the delivery service in the UK and the local UPS store I used was unhelpful. It's taken about 1 month to ship a pair of glasses. Don't offer services you cannot see through."
"Why can't I give 0 stars???

This company should have 0 stars. Or preferably even minus in stars. They seems to be unable to deliver a simple package.

And calling customer service is a joke. Polite people who is unable to create any kind of action.

Package was supposed to be delivered Friday. None rang on the door and no note of missed delivery was posted on the door. Same happened on Monday. And I found out just on Tuesday as I was waiting for the package and went to ups.com.

Called customer service. They said they had been there but did not ring the door or leave a note of missed delivery (!?). They suggested that I changed the address as I said that I the next days would be at work during the day. At a nearby address, after being home on Friday and Monday. And then delivery would be on Tuesday. For sure.

Nope. So I called again on Tuesday. An error had happened on their side. But would be delivered on Wednesday. Nope. So I called again. Very sorry, will be for sure on Thursday. Nope. And here I am.

No package. No delivery. And the website tells me that ""requested address change - pending"".

I have no clue if I will ever get this package. As it stands now its more likely I won't. And the content will be damaged if it stay in the package too long.

Do not. In any way. Choose to send anything with this company. They are absolutely unable to perform the service they advertise. And as a customer it only give you a poor mood to use this company."
"As usual, terrible service! I live in a very well known and nice area yet in the past UPS did not deliver twice, not just once, claiming they could not find the address... Ridiculous. Now, waiting all day at home for a promised signature required delivery for yesterday, I get an email after 10 PM stating my delivery date has changed and that they will be delivering the following day. Well... we'll see if it arrives. Some of the smaller couriers are much more trustworthy than UPS."
I dont have any problem with UPS service and delivery guy.. He didnt have a respect. He dont know how to talk with the customers. Please teach them how to respect the peoples.. Last time also he was angry. Now its continued..
"i was home, they stated that nobody was at home, so didint delivered anything"
Bad company/Staff as always losing track about their parcels
Automated phone service is absolutely worthless. Give us a human being to speak to and stop turning away your customers when they need assistance.
"My rug was due for delivery on Friday. Then, without warning, it was changed to the following Tuesday when I would not be in. I had to register with UPS to change it to the Wednesday. I got an email to say it would come on the Tuesday and need a signature. Again I changed it to the following week. It still came on the Tuesday when I was out and was left, so no signature was even needed!!!"
"I have no problems with any other delivery companies at my address, but ups confuses my address with another one in a completely different county every time. Took me 3 days to get in touch with an actual person and my package was already being held by then. To make matters worse, the customer service representative gave me the wrong ups location. The location it was being held at was 50 miles from the original delivery location."
"How can they be so bad? UPS is worth 140 billion and outside of really nice drivers the company is abysmal. We recently had a regional rep come to our store wanting to offer various programs incentives etc. We agreed and throughout the process they changed our account number for some reason (we had same number for many years prior) and without us knowing. This ended up causing problems with some of our connecting shipping software and it led to unpaid bill as the old account was removed from our online billing. Once it was brought to our attention we paid the bill as we always do but some angry UPS accounting / billing decided to ""suspend"" our account without telling us. So for weeks we have shipping issues causing major operational headaches for our business. Even our regional sales rep could not figure out why our account was unable to ship. After many many hours of very valuable time we finally spoke to yet another angry employee in the billing department who told us ""you should have paid your bill"" lecturing us about the billing agreement. It doesn't take much to see how many things are wrong with this situation in that UPS put one of its customers into a really bad situation despite no real fault of the customer. This is just the latest in a string of bad experiences with UPS."
Omg ups is the worst carrier ever.. this was my first and definitely last time using there service. Package was suppose to be here 7-1-22 but some how got rescheduled to be delivered on 7-5-22. I call customer service and the rep had the nerve to say it was delayed because of the weather! 😂😂😂 NEVER AGAIN!
Worst company to deal with. Left a sticker outside my door to say they missed me yet I was home they couldn’t be bothered to knock. Then told me it was in the ups store I have gone to both stores none of them have it and was told to call a number while I’m currently being passed from person to person and no one has an answer or cares the slightest such bad customer service. 200$ just wasted.
"This has to be the ABSOLUTE WORST shipping company of them all! The customer service reps don’t speak English, nor are they ANY HELP when you call. I’m sure drivers steal packages as well. I had a delivery in Ga that ended up in PA. I was certain tracking numbers were specific to one package. How can you not find a package if only one number goes to each package? If I could take UPS out of my package shipping and receiving all together I would be a happy camper. Too bad it’s not possible. I absolutely HATE UPS! The only good thing about this company is the storefront service. The rest of it is COMPLETE TRASH!!!!"
"I have never experienced such terrible service before….never.
My parcel is week over due, the UPS access point I chose for delivery reject my parcel, even after I paid the tax required.

I call the customer care the cut the phone on me more that five times in this process, one even went ahead to ask me personal questions. I seriously don’t think UPS record calls by their staffs.

I am exhausted chasing my parcel around, I am yet to get it and I deeply regret using UPS."
The worst “customer service” and drivers are incompetent. They don’t even have basic customer service who can provide any time of resolution or problem solving. Waited all day to sign for a package only to get a notification on my phone that they attempted delivery but no one was home to sign. I was sitting in my living room the whole day waiting. No one ever rang my doorbell or knocked on my door. “Customer service” did nothing to try to resolve the issue. They keep telling me “dispatch will call you”. Dispatch NEVER calls. Now I have to have the package returned to the sender and figure out a different way to have it delivered. Never had issues like this with any other delivery company.
I can not get in touch with a representative. My package is missing and they won’t let me file a claim or speak to a human! Worst delivery company I have ever dealt with.
"My express delivery wasn’t delivered the day I was supposed to receive. The worst thing is, the customer service. There is no service at all. How come a whole UPS company doesn’t have a tracking system of their chauffeurs."
UPS wants to destroy packages rather than deliver them; DO NOT TRUST THEM. Playing politics with packages: are they nuts??? Apparently so; perhaps instead of worrying about political nonsense they should be taking better care of their drivers as one just died to heat stroke over the weekend.
"Don't trust UPS. They are dishonest and incompetent!. Was expecting to receive 5 packages on Monday, never turned up. Phoned customer service. Took 45 mins to get through. Then 2 boxes turned up on Tuesday morning. Was told the rest would turn later in the day. Nothing came. Waited late. Phoned again and again, was passed around or hung up on. On Wed one box turned up. No information given on the rest of the boxes. It's late Wed and still no information. Will never use this company again."
another big company playing politics and deciding to side with 1 half of the country and screw the rest. Good luck on losing half of your revenue. Disgusting how they try to bully people. Deleted my account with them and won't be using them any more.
"Ups scum say they will be destroying your package if it contains anything, ""offensive"". That means they will be breaking the law by checking your private mail, and tampering with it. They are owned by traitors and have bent the knee to this joke, administration. If you're missing a package sue them. It's illegal, and like all scum woke companies they will lose millions. Use anyone else you can, if you can't, get together with others and sue them together. Enough and we can ruin them. They are breaking the law."
"I live in an apartment and the last three times that I ordered something and was waiting for delivery, it was after hours. Instead of the delivery person calling up to my apartment to have me come down and get it, they stated that I refused delivery and that I said I would come pick it up at the warehouse. So, in essence my delivery was cancelled because of this behavior. I have called and voiced my concernes about this, as well as changing where they are to leave my package from now on. I'm hoping this resolves issues going forward."
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. With all of the shipping services out there, I have no clue why anyone would use UPS. Honestly, I’m baffled by how they are still in business. I’ve never, and I truly mean never, have had a good experience with UPS. My most recent experience was the last straw and honestly if a company uses their services to ship, I’ll look elsewhere from now on. The seller dropped my package off on the 27th, by the 28th UPS had lost my package. It literally never left their facility and it got lost. How incompetent can a company be? On top of that, dealing with their phone system is a true nightmare from hell. But when you do finally get in touch with a representative, they are literally just glorified secretaries. They can’t research anything for you or help you in any way. An investigation into a lost package takes 8 business days to even begin. When asking if you can put a complaint and have a higher up get in touch with you, your met with a no but are told that they can request someone reach out to you within 3-5 business days……."
"This place is complete garbage. God forbid they ever deliver a package on time. Most worthless delivery company ever. You'd have better luck having a toddler with a ADHD deliver your stuff. Dont use them, and if you order anything thorough anyone make sure they don't use these rejects either."
"UPS has great customer service, packages delivered to the door in a timely maner. Thank you UPS."
If you have the option to choose UPS shipping you may as well forget about receiving your package at all. At least you’ll save the stress and the time and the money. The customer service is awful and the drivers are probably the most incompetent human beings on the face of the planet. I mean how hard is it to look at a package and deliver it to the address. I promise that whenever I get a chance to badmouth UPS I will. I don’t think I’ve ever dealt with a more incompetent delivery service. I still haven’t gotten my issue resolved and I’ve contacted customer service five times. They want to try and charge me to spend my gas to drive 20 miles to their sorting Station to pick up my package. This is the worst company.
Ups was to lazy to even deliver my package. I had to go to a store to pick it up. That is not what I paid for.
This is absolutely the worse shipping company I have ever had to deal with. I had a Amazon return to send back so they showed up with the shipping label never knocked on my door or anything left the label lying on the ground in front of my steps. The ups driver drives by my house daily made no attempt to stop and get the package. So I called ups to see what the problem was with picking up my return there answer was you must schedule a pick up appointment sense you wasn’t home I was home when there driver guy brought the label but he failed to take the time to knock on my door. So they told me it would cost me ten dollars to reschedule my pickup noway in hell I will do business with a computer like this.
"Bad service overall. They do not respond to e-mails, the driver apparently was at the gate, and apparently tried to call. There is no call registered on my phone. So now I just have to wait until the next working day, which will only be the next Monday!"
"Pity I can't give zero stars.

Repeatedly this company charges me extra as they measure the size of my absolutely standard boxes as different to reality and if ever faced with doing the imports take weeks to months and multiple requests for the same information to do that.

If you ring up they have no idea what is going on, tell you different answers to the same question and then promise to ""escalate"" the issue......which sounds good doesn't it.....but really means they write an email to a separate department that just means you get more delays.

No manager is ever available, no phone call is ever returned and no-one gives a damm."
"An appointment was made for the pickup, but cancelled at the end of the working day due to problems of the chauffeur. The cancellation should have been done earlier. They waisted my time!
The Chauffeur who brought the carpet was too weak for such a function, and was not able to carry it!"
The absolute worst option for shipping. The customer service is atrocious and they damage and misdeliver nearly every package that has ever been shipped to me through them. It has been so awful that I will be double checking with companies now to make sure they won't be shipping through them before I will order.
"Horrible tracking, Horrible website, when I called the number they said my tracking number was not real so I got on the actual website typed in the same number got an alternate number they said that one was not valid. The costumer service agent acted like I was an idiot. When I laughed about the situation he asked why I was laughing. I informed him that the whole situation was ridiculous. This is the worst shipping company, website and customer service I have ever experienced. Ever since Tom Hanks got in the plane crash this company has went downhill all the way to hell. Lol. If I could give them a lower rating I would."
"“First and foremost, im absolutely infuriated with the handling of our package from UPS today. Our business opens at 10:00am during the week. It is clearly stated in our entrance. The UPS driver said he was there at 9:55am and didn't drop off the package because no one was there and decided to reschedule the delivery for NEXT DAY!

We called UPS and they said that if we wanted to chose a drop location instead, they would charge $8 more to go pick it up. The driver has already stated that they will not come back to drop off our package.
We paid EXPENSIVE NEXT-DAY AIR DELIVERY because we needed the part TODAY. Our business relies on replacing computer/mobile components and thanks to your inconsiderate driver, we have a customer who is upset about our turnaround promise.
Total lack of accountability on UPS and its employees”
Update:
Last message from UPS
“ Hi, I understand your concern, it is the driver's discretion to release packages if a business is closed. Another attempt will be made tomorrow, I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. - Mark”
Not very helpful"
"If there was a place for Zero stars I would do that. I had 2 packages going to delivered on the 27 and the other on the 28th of June 2022. One I payed to overnite. I received word that I would receive the over night package on the 29th. and the other package that has been out for 8 days on the 29th, 2 different destinations. When I checked my tracking it stated an attempt was made for delivery and I have to pick it up on the 30th at a sub station. They never made any attempt on both packages. The was just to lazy to deliver my late packages. That now I have to go and get. I will try so hard not to use UPS. They are the worst company I ever had to deal with. They brag about how much money(97billion) they made by doing very little. Promises are not kept only your money."
"I feel very frustrated with UPS, the objective of checking the UPS tracking is to know when the package arrives, I did it several times yesterday and it always said out for delivery, at 4:40 pm, I check the web page the same information 4:52 pm, I see a notice that said that UPS had tried to leave the package but had taken it, totally a lie, I have a Ring camera, two dogs that bark when they see someone approaching the door, when did UPS arrive at my house? The bad thing was that when I called the company that had ordered the item, they repeated the same message that UPS had left that no one was home. UPS is not interested in leaving packages outside they never expect a person to open the door, this item was only $60, if they don't want to do the job they shouldn't lie, now the company won't return the $15.99 I paid for two days of shipping.I called the UPS customer service to show my dissatisfaction with this situation and that it doesn't happen again to anyone else, but they don't do anything they just listen but don't give solutions, the only thing they told me was that I had to have called that same day for make a compliment, but I thought the best solution was to call the company where the item was bought, but they believed the lie because they did not return the money."
I HATE UPS! They are the absolute worst. It’s absolutely absurd that they make you pay to pick up your package if you know you won’t be home for any of the 3 delivery attempts. It should be free or there should be other options. It’s my package and I’m an average working class citizen that can’t sit at home all day waiting for a package-I shouldn’t have to pay extra for that.
Very bad company. Can't find the appropriate word to describe how crap the delivery service is.
"Dreadful company, appalling accountability and customer service. I sent a small chair with UPS. It weighed 4.6kg but I marked it as 6kg to be safe. The box measurements were exact and they charged me £28.70 to send in the UK. 2 months later they charged me an additional £49.12 as they had been told the item weighed 46.55kg by UPS!! I weigh 90kg and a small kitchen table chair does not weigh half what I do. I challenged this and they said I need 4 photos showing the box with a tape measure. I said this was 2 months ago and does anyone take images like this. I gave them the contact number for the person who bough tthe chair to verify this yet they are uniterested. They said I have no right to appeal. This is theft so I have claimed it back now from the credit card company and I am also issuing a County Court summons for costs incurred. I have also promised to tell the world how dishonest ParcelHero and UPS are. I had used ParcelHero a lot over the last few years so their attitude is very short sighted... Avoid them at all costs"
"I cringe even giving UPS 1 star. Worst tracking system and worst customer service ever. I mailed a document in an envelope. When it didn't arrive on time, the first excuse was it was delayed because it wouldn't fit in the truck. Really????? It's an envelope! It is now 2 days after original promised delivery date and the online tracking says delivery date unknown. I will never trust UPS with a shipment again. Inexcusable service."
"An electrical fault has prolonged your delivery,
Then they tell me it will be delivered on the 29th
That came and went,
Now they say a flight delay has prolonged delivery .
I see my package arrive at Stansted 3 miles from my house,
That was 3 days ago and it still says due to a flight delay your delivery is prolonged.
Never ever ever again.
Usless Postal Service.
About sums them up"
They claimed they delivered my item. I never received it. Trying to file a claim online is a joke. Customer Service don't answer the phone.
"I bought urgent delivery with UPS Express. The website says 1-2 days. I was hoping for 1, but was ready to accept 2. Guess what, all the updates I am getting are ""we made this mistake, so this will delay the delivery"", ""we missed a planned schedule, so this will delay the delivery"", ""the area code was wrong (it wasn´t) so this may delay the delivery"". These guys can´t put their act together. It´s been 3 days and STILL not at the destination. Not giving my money to you guys again. You suck!"
"UPS has atrocious customer service. A few weeks ago, a UPS delivery driver cussed my husband out & threatened to have his friend, “come back and take care of my family & my dog”. The dog barked at the driver, and the driver called his boss & claimed the dog attacked him. This is all on camera. The driver LIED. Well, after spending 3 weeks being passed from person to person at UPS and calling DAILY, I spoke to the drivers supervisor. She called me a liar & stated that she stands behind her drivers. She satiated that if I had common sense, I would know that if an animal had teeth, it can bite. I tried to explain that the dog only barked at the driver, and again was called a liar. I offered to send her the videos & she spoke over me while saying she didn’t need to see them etc. I have never been treated so disrespectfully by a supposed customer service agent. My husband then called UPS because the person I spoke to hung up on me after stating that they’ll never deliver to my address again due to my, “vicious dog who is the problem”. This dog stays in a 20x20 kennel and is only outside when we are. This dog is not vicious, and only barked at the driver because the driver was running towards the house and SCREAMING AND CUSSING at the top of his lungs! Anyways, my husband calls UPS after I told him about my conversation and he was assured that no phone call was documented or on file. I spent almost 60 minutes ON HOLD before getting treated like dirt by this supposed supervisor. I know am under the impression that a stocker or friend of the driver got on the phone & lied to me just with the intention to belittle me and disrespect me. When I asked for her supervisor, I was told that she is the supervisor over the drivers & that there is no one above her. This is insane. So now our packages are not being delivered and we have to worry about this man sending someone to our house in retaliation. Please someone post a list of retailers who do not use UPS because I will share it far and wide!"
"Horrible experience

Feels like it’s 2005 all over again. I ask for the parcel to be delivered in a parcel shop. The parcel is on hold for 2 days and then I receive the statement that the parcel shop is denied.

I ask for delivery on an alternate address (address of the company I work for). It takes two days, again, for them to process the change. If I had known that, I wouldn’t have chosen that alternate address because it’ll be on a day I’m not at work.

I should have had the parcel delivered on Monday. Now it looks like I will get it one week later because of the slow processes within UPS."
"The worst shipping company.

I had used FedEx and USPS, and I love how they update you and deliver before the estimated delivery time. But when it comes to ups, it takes them a month to ship and deliver your package and you are not even able to track the package. Their website doesn’t work as well."
"Avoid like the plague

Honest to God the worst automated prompts for their phone line.... bring back customer service and stop being lazy and cheap"
"This company sucks so much, I just no longer order stuff from companies that use UPS to (never) deliver the order. No more DJI, no more Planet Computer and many more. F U UPS!"
"I arranged an Express Pack collection in France to be returned to the UK. It's now approaching 3 weeks and I still don't have it. No one seems to know what's going on in their customer service - I genuinely would have been quicker walking to the South of France and back to London with my consignment than this and feel like I don't have anywhere else to turn but to leave a review. Annoyingly they have so many bad reviews, this review will make no difference to them."
"I shipped parcel on 16 May 2022, 0.35 kg, 21 x 14 x 6 cm, and paid the amount due through UPS website. After the parcel was delivered, my card was charged additional amount by UPS without my authorisation or any prior notice. Upon my enquiry, I was told that this was due to my parcel being 29 x 15 x 8 cm which was completely wrong. I then provided evidence that my parcel was 21 x 14 x 6 cm, as I declared, and I requested refund of the wrongly charged additional amount. I have not received any refund for more than a month since my request and UPS are now just ignoring my repeated requests/reminders. Never again ship with UPS."
"I really don't understand these delivery companies. They lose a package for an entire week, and when they do eventually find it, rather than fix their mistake, they continue to ship it in the slowest way possible."
The worst delivery company. They broke my graphic card. The parcel was crashed.
"Worst experiencew ever. Within month they misplaced/lossed thre packages worth of wich were ~$2000. First one they delivered to the wrong house ( I guess they randomly dropped it without checking house number).
Second and third were lost and currently vendor is opened investigation.
Dont deal with them - you will loose your time and money"
So I called to check on my package to see where it was bc it stated in was in Lake Charles where I stay. And why they had a delay with Trailors. Well I was told it was in New Orleans on Plane and then on a train and when I asked to speak to supervisor Rosanna got very rude. So I had to keep asking her and tell her to do her job that's what she is there for I tried to b as patient as possible bc I done heard a lot of ppl gettin crazy with them on phone well she finally put supervisor on phone and not once did she listen to my complaints or even let me talk to her to explain my issue all she did was out talk me like I was a child that was not professional so when I started getting crazy and cursing she wants to tell me that I'm not being professional well sorry but where you being professional to me not letting me speak or explain anything well no you wasn't so me being nice and polite went completely out the window. All I wanted to know was why it stayed my package was in Lake Charles but then all of a sudden as they say in New Orleans on a plane or train they so say when I got an update saying it was a delay with Trailor and my package. They don't help they are very rude and they don't care. I hate going threw ups fed ex and usps or 100 times way better then them and they explain and help you figure out the issue better then ups. I don't even see why ups is even open or they need to herons some better works with better attitudes that help ppl understand bc there attitude makes them and the company look very bad and ppl not wanting to go threw them at all. If I could give zero stars I really really would. Never been satisfied with ups. But wen ordering online you have to go with who they choose
First the customer service is tragic. Say this promising that. Urgent message they will call within the hour. Didn't happen. Just false promises and no control over their own goods. They told me my parcel was list in transit. But another company got me more better info and wasn't lost. So ups customer service. That's all on you.
They play on with costumers' intelligence. When you call them one is directing you to another and problem is not solved. It is a technique to get rid of you. I made for the second time my life the mistake to trust them and receive the poorest service in my life. But this time I'm not going to leave it like that. If they don't respond to my complaint I will have any kind of right with my side to dispute the payment from my bank. With two words: UPs-ridiculous and disgusting
The last three times I had a package delivered to my home. There's a wall around the front porch closing it in. On the driver would put the packages right on the wall which means everybody who drives by walks by can see them and pick them up. Because they're too lazy to walk around and put it inside the wall where it would be hidden. Like every other company does and like UPS used to.
"I live with my 80-year-old mother she returned an item from Amazon through your company. This driver came to pick up her package unfortunately I was in the back of the house. This driver was very disrespectful telling my mother he gets paid by the hour and if she doesn't find the right label he would have to leave. I get paid by the hour also very well and over time so, please tell me what was the purpose of that statement? I've been in retail for 20 years I would never treat an elderly lady so disrespectful I can't believe this is the way you train your drivers to treat your customers. I will be taking this situation higher up."
"Waste of time.
Not going to be in for delivery. Trying to change day but keeps coming up error try again later.
It's not rocket science, far too much messing just to deliver a parcel.
Would rather use royal mail. If you're not in they take the parcel to a local depot where you can pick it up! If you have a system at least make sure it's fit for purpose."
"Ups shipped my pair of running shoes. Shoes stranded at a an access point and never got to my local pick-up point. No mail, no txt, no nothing about the status. Now its being returned to sender."
"How hard is it if you can't find an address to call the recipient. I'm a new address on my route but I've lived here for 3+ years now. It's not the first time getting a package from UPS but for some reason this time they seem to be having a hard time. If Fed Ex will call for help, why won't UPS. Will not make this mistake again using UPS is definitely a bad idea."
"If you have any problem with your package, you will really have a huge headache with UPS. You cannot speak with anyone, it's always a robot. DHL is AWAY better than UPS."
"I bought an electronic drum kit 1 month ago and they keep saying that “It’s on its way” but every time something new shows up, like: “Your parcel is in customs clearance”, “Your parcel has been forwarded to the destination city”, but a few days later, nothing changes. Not even going to talk about the awful custom service, they gave me the wrong payment value and I payed someone’s else parcel. Awful."
"The worst delivery service.

DO NOT USE."
"I order some airsoft accessories and they were supposed to arrive on Saturday, but now it is sunday and the tracking shows that the package was in my city and is now in a different city over an hour away, so I will never use ups again after this horrible experience."
"The Griffin location by Walmart is the best! Always courteous, store is clean and smells great! Every drop off is quick and easy!! Highly recommend!!"
"Don't use this service. Terrible delays, items arriving broken. I ordered a computer that was shipped by UPS and in front of me the delivery guy kicked the box and dropped it! The computer was completely broken inside and the seller had to send me another one.
And now I'm waiting for 2 weeks for an order of live insects that were supposed to be delivered in 3 days. Awful."
"Don’t trust UPS with your fragile items. I ordered a frame for my daughters graduation picture and it arrived totally shattered. I will admit the store should have labeled the package at the very least, but it’s still worth noting, fragile items may not arrive in good condition if delivered by UPS"
"I have Shipped several packages from the UPS Customer Center located at 4455 Stonecroft BLVD Chantilly Va. I would like give a shout out to two outstanding employees Pam Philips, Cassandra Price. Every time I come in to the center I am greeted with two beautiful smiles, and two awesome professional attitudes, they always ask me how may we serve you today? They are very knowledgeable of all my shipping needs and always ready and willing to answer all my shipping questions. Pam & Cassandra are the (BEST) Thank you UPS for having such outstanding employees.
RUSSELL"
"Not only the worst customer service ever, but also the worst tracking and delivery service out of any carrier on this planet. Buy 1-2 day shipping and you still get it in two weeks. Try tracking your package and it won’t even give you updates or tell you when it was delivered. Try calling customer service about any concerns and you can’t reach anyone other than a robot that doesn’t know how to help you. I don’t know how anyone uses UPS anymore. Worst f***ing service ever."
"Terrible service. If your package was shipped with UPS except major delays, and nobody knowing what’s going on, that is if your package ever even gets delivered."
Very satisfied with the delivery service.
"We ordered Braves tshirts from Amazon and they were shipped UPS…. We ordered in Sunday to be delivered Thursday for a game on Saturday.. great…. Thursday they were out for delivery all day and we were here all day and they never came…. Got an alert that they would be delivered Friday by 7pm…. I was here all day and at 5:40 I get an alert that delivery was attempted but there was no one home to give an adult signature?? Wait.. WHAT? For tshirts? And yes I’ve been here all day and no one attempted to deliver anything…. I reached out to UPS customer care and they said they were so sorry & someone would call me within the hour…. NOTHING.. delivery expected Monday…. Too late, will either decline the delivery or return to Amazon.. What a tacky, lying, piece of crap.. very frustrated and frankly PISSED OFF.. Screw you UPS and your lying, lazy, in efficiency.. Hopefully Amazon will stop using them asap!"
I couldn’t find my package and called for help when I spoke with Mary she made sure we would find my package. Outstanding Customer Service and we found my package. Way to Go!
"Please note my horrible experience with UPS. They have come 1st day and didn’t even ring a bell, and were going away but my aunt was outside so she saw and asked for the product. They asked for the VAT payment but in cash. We wanted to pay by card so they rescheduled the delivery for the next day. We paid the vat by telephone that day and today they were supposed to come again, but they didn’t come. I have received an email saying that they did not find us, while my aunt was sitting outside the whole time. Aunt told them that they have a CC tv camera so she can show that no delivery person came, and that’s when they caved and said that the delivery man never went there assuming that we still haven’t paid the VAT yet (which we paid immediately on the first day). But their email says we were not at the house. And they don’t call or ring the bell because they want the users to get their plus subscription."
"AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!
Avoid at all costs. They have no idea what they are doing.

I ordered a package to De Buren lockers and it was delivered on Monday. I tried to collect it but turns out they didn't send me the code to open the locker! After 15 min talk with the customer service lady told me I will get the code the next day. The next day my email and phone number are quiet so I call them again. Another lady tells me it is the last 8 digits of the tracking number. So I rush to the lockers again and of course, the code does not work... Again the lady tells me to just wait till they get to me back through email. I finally got the code on Friday(!!!) but they managed to send me a notification on their app a couple of hours before I received the code that the time to collect the package has expired and they will send it back. Unbelievable! Even though I got the email that stated I have 2 weeks to collect the package (not 4 days). The package was fortunately still in the locker and I got it. But it is definitely not worth the stress and additional waiting time.

Such an awful company and customer service who does not know what they are doing. They take 5 days to send a code to open the locker. I do not recommend using their services to anyone."
Such a shame. bad customer service. I had not reported the house number and no one sent me an email or called me to notify me. Not an email received to inform me of the problem upon delivery. I had to find out and contact assistance. After that I cancel my order. I will fill up a claim for sure. A bad service. Not recommended. DHL is a thousand times better
On time. Superb!!
"The customer service is unhelpful and mean! I got a panic attack talking to them on the phone. Someone rescheduled my delivery date even thought I did not request it. Then the driver came 3 times and said that I am not at home when I was waiting for him all week at home. He did not even try calling me because apparently they dont have a professional phone. How is it even possible ? Anyway, I spent my days calling UPS like 4-5 times per day because they would promise to call me back reassuring that they will deliver it today. But it did not happen. Then they always have bugs on the website for my status and they never communicate on the website when the package will arrive. Nightmare ! I will never use this delivery service for my own brand and for anything else. I have been still waiting for my package."
UPS makes it very hard to inquire about a package that they have lost in their system. They make the customer do all the work reporting it on a hard to navigate website. And it requires a file to be loaded with proof of value. And the file type is very limited as to the type they will accept. Over all very poor customer service.
"6.13 gives awb for 6.11 order but parcel was sitting at UK till I check status on 6.17. Then to deliver on 6.22.

3 days were expected to receive in the past."
"Always the worst service ever, I don't know why are you still in business or at list try to work on your delivery services. My package delivery update status changed 3 times in 3 days , ""out for delivery "" then it goes back to ""delay"" ans still don't have my package. This was within canada for 1 business day delivery. I called customer service they repeat the same thing, I don't know where my package is and irresponsible UPS can't track it's own drivers. Called 3 times so far no one tries to help. Very bad service . Take some responsibility on your service UPS and don't waste people's time and money."
"SAVE YOUR SANITY and just pay extra to use DHL or FexEX. At least you'll get your package without having to go through their customer ""service"" hell 10 times"
"worst experience ever. looks like they already have enough negative reviews... but this is the worst online experience I've ever had. Charged me, errored out, no support. UGH!!!!!"
UPS blows. Includes drivers on up. Use FedEx or USPS.
Had the best delivery driver. He stopped to help me move my dead car and was so nice.
"You guys are pitiful from your robot phone operator, to customer service, to the delivery person. NOBODY THERE KNOWS ANYTHING!!!! YOU KEEP PUTTING MY ORDER ON HOLD NOT ME. WHOMEVER IS OVER THIS DEPT LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE. HIRE PIZZA DELIVERY GUYS THEY KNOW HOW TO FIND ADDRESSES. THESE PEOPLE YOU HAVE ARE ALL INCOMPETENT."
Have simply just never been even satisified.
"Lying into a customer’s face. Sickening. Irresponsible, negligent, ignorant anti-service, though well paid. There will be justice."
Lost my package AS IT WAS 10 MILES FROM MY HOUSE. Absolutely worthless company.
"Check tracking around 8:40am and it stated that my package was processed at my local facility at 8:12a and being returned to sender. I get home around 9:05am and start trying to someone on the phone which wasn't happening. I tried the chat which wasn't helpful. I somehow figure out how to get them to call me back which happens at 10:02a. Speaking with the CSR was like talking to the automated machine, she just kept repeating the script. After about 10 minutes me asking why can't she contact my local facility and her stating I have to contact the sender, she finally says she'll send them as message and have them call me. I get that call at 10:17a. This lady would only say ""you have to contact the sender"" I'm asking ""is the package still there, I can come pick it up"" only to hear ""sir, you'll have to contact the sender."" How and why would a package be processed and sent back within 2 hours? It makes no sense. The unwillingness to try and rectify the issue has got me never wanting to use their services ever again."
I wanted to report a scam but it will not let you talk to someone. I got a text from supposedly ups saying I owe 4.20 and wanted credit card info and social security and wanted to speak to someone but the robot won't let me. So frustrating
"HORROR SHOW, they let my parcel rotten at customs service sending me confusing notifications and no way to fix the problem. I finally had to write a letter myself to free the package and that was 15 days later!!! NEVER USE THIS COMPANY'S SERVICES FOR YOUR OWN GOOD"
Very poor service seems to be not professional at all and have keeps on calling them again again and have explain the same situation again and again very very disappointed.
"UPS is horrible! Paid for 2 day air delivery on 6/16/22 and today is 6/21/22 and no delivery. Tracking showed delivery today, 6/21/22 and no delivery. Tracking showed package arrived to local UPS on 6/18/22 and it has not moved in 4 days. Tried calling their customer service desk, which happens to be in the Philippines and of course talked with Mary, who I could hardly understand. Zero help and wanted me to fill out paperwork so they could research. This put me further to the edge of the cliff. She transferred call to investigations, who was of Latino and I could hardly understand him. He filled out the investigation report and said the local UPS (Camdenton, MO) would call me in 1 hr. 3.5 hrs later I call UPS back and talk to a nice lady, who I could understand. She said she would get more details for me but had to place me on hold. When placed on hold….click and disconnected. So, I know she has my number, so am waiting on a call back. Been another hour and no call back. UPS system does not work. I want answers and I want senior management involved and I want a full refund of my shipping. So why is this package so important. It is vital medication for one of our family pets. Cost of these pills is just over $1000.00. UPS doesn’t give a damn about their customers, they lie at every level you talk too. They offer services and timelines they can’t meet. Their shipping costs are too expensive. They repeat gas service charges for fuel, but when fuel prices under Trump fell drastically they never took those fuel charges off. I’m so pissed I can’t think straight now. So who are you going to call….you’re just back in the same worthless due loop. This is criminal and only one company is worse than UPS and that’s Century Link Phone Co. There needs to be a class action law suit against them. Rant over…UPS can kiss my a….s!"
"The UPS guy thriw my 1000 phone one the cement front stoop, ny dog went crazy as I ran out of my house I said guy UPS guy and he yelled back that your cell phone bye. It was lole 9o degree out hut wow"
I received an email advising my package would be delivered between 1245 and 345 today. At the same time on the website it says by 7 PM. It’s after seven now it’s saying by the end of the day. How can we trust anything UPS says. This has ruined my entire day waiting for the package!
Customer service does not exist in whatever universe they live in.
The same as most and obviously UPS doesn't care. I never got a knock or doorbell ring. My package was left and still shows in route on the tracking so I didn't even know it was there. The package is a thousand dollar item that was supposed to get a signature but of course UPS doesn't care.
"I cannot believe how bad UPS is. I tried to overnight a package on Friday, May 27, 2022, the Friday before Memorial Day. I paid for overnight SATURDAY DELIVERY and the package arrived at the destination the following TUESDAY, May 31, 2022. Surprisingly, I was refunded the full amount within a few days. After that I was trying to do the same thing, overnight a package but this time it was just a weekday. When entering the address into the website, the system automatically pulled the next town over from where I wanted to send it. I had already paid and printed the label, but figured I could just go into my account and edit the label. NOPE. I was told I needed to void the incorrect label and start over, which meant I had to pay for overnight shipping AGAIN. Since I had no choice but to take this option, I paid for overnight shipping again, and now nearly ONE MONTH has passed and I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN REFUNDED. All I’m getting are a few apologies after I have spent HOURS trying to get this refund. I have been hung up on, disconnected and ignored. I’m not sure what can be done, but I refuse to let this go, even if I do get the refund."
The driver never knocked on my door and kept leaving stickers even though we were home. we get a final return to sender sticker and now we can't even get an agent on the phone because the phone system won't let you get through.
"Worse company ever. I have arranged the international (UK -> Greece) shipment of a few parcels containing personal belongings after getting a quote from their customer service and completing all the forms online with estimated clearance costs. Since the overall cost was reasonable (100£), I decided to send several items. Now UPS Greece holds my parcels, has decided to open them to value them (what they can find is only old clothes and books of no values) and asked me to pay 400 euros for 7 of 12 of these boxes. There was no transparency ever on such import customs clearance charges, which are not mentioned nor specified on their website now from any person I spoke on the phone from the customer assistance. They said that the parcels will be abandoned if I do not pay the full amount."
I ordered a water fountain on home depot website. Not only did it end up in a UPS warehouse for six days but it arrived shattered into pieces.
"ups online services are stupidly designed and useless unless its by design.
too many hoops to jump through to accurately track my package"
"OMG, worst company ever.
Three packages were supposed to be delivered on Friday. Two to the ups store and one to my home. The one to my home now has a delivery estimate of next Saturday, and they sent me this notice at midnight after I was waiting around all day for the package, which is now delayed by 8 days. The two deliveries to the ups store that they marked as delivered, so I spent the time and money to take uber over there, only to find out the packages was not delivered. one is now marked as lost and the other as being rerouted. How can you possibly F up three deliveries on the same day to two different locations? DO NOT USE UPS."
"UPS Chaparral/Hayden, Scottsdale, Az.
Only 3 stars for overall service however, Assistant Manager Malorie should get 5 stars as she tried so diligently to resolve the difficult shipping problem I had. My items were packaged professionally."
I had a tv shipped with all original packaging packed perfectly Paid for insurance. Spent 300$ to ship tv to new house and the package handler slammed the tv on the ground all by himself. Goin through 2 weeks now my claim got denied and now ups is telling me it was because I didn’t package it enough. My brand new sony bravia 120 htz gaming tv is useless and ups will not pay the claim. Do not ever use ups. They are terrible
NEVER use UPS!! They don't deserve any stars. They lost my parcel unable to track it!! Customer service is diabolical. Adviser and managers lie about calling you back. I was told my parcel was left on the floor for a week!! They cannot refund the cost and nor transfer my parcel from France to UK. Are they not international? They blame COVID for everything!!
The worst ever!!!! And customer service suck more. UPS make online ordering a nightmare.
"Lol, they didn't deliver package as they were to busy?? That was the excuse given by one of their simple minded agents.

What a joke

I had to drive into city , pay for parking to get a delivery I paid for

Honestly worst service ever"
If I could give negative stars I would. I tried to pay invoice via paypal and they never took the money. After months of trying to pay it and ups not doing anything they passed it to collection. What a malicious company
"I am very happy with all the aspects of ordering on the site as well as delivery and product
Thanks again Drillshed"
"Absolute garbage. Won’t deliver my package because I’m “not home”. No sh!t, it’s 10am on a Thursday. I’m working. They refuse to leave my package at my door. The first delivery driver left a note saying it would be delivered to the nearest UPS store for pickup. I go to the store, it’s not there. They gave me a number to call to tell them to leave package at door because I won’t be home. I call the number and tell them and they said the delivery driver already decided to bring it to store for pickup and to pick it up tomorrow. The next day, a different delivery driver tries to deliver it again. Again, they don’t leave the package because I “need to sign” for it. I then had to go online to create an account and pay $6 for them to bring it to the ups store for me to pick up because if I didn’t, they would’ve tried to deliver again on Monday where once again I wouldn’t be home to sign for it and they’d send it back to the manufacturer. What was a one day delivery process has now turned into a 4 day delivery process. Not impressed at all."
"My delivery has been ""Out for delivery today"" for 5 days. Their customer service is rude and unhelpful. No one at UPS is willing to help find out why they won't deliver my package. There is no way to get a manager or supervisor to work on the problem. All the customer service person does is read the same information that you can get online. They are frustrating and not a customer service oriented company to deal with. I avoid UPS and get the chills knowing they are delivering a package to my business."
"Fifth time was not the charm. Horrible tracker that claims there are errors or unavailable costumers that's just a front for not doing their jobs. When calling customer support they are aware that tracker and drivers are cheating and say they will make sure the package is in time, despite the trackers info, but nothing ever happens. Last time i used UPS it was scheduled for 3 days delivery, it took 14. The package ""failed to be delivered 3 times"" and was going back to sender before i managed, after about 45 calls, to come into contact with higher ups to personally force the process through.
The saddest part is that this absolute joke of a company is forced upon us by sellers."
Worst!!! I need the package that’s why I paid for 2 days. Now I’m in a hurry to find a dress for my daughter for her baptism tomorrow
Paid $100 for 2nd day delivery with a return. Missing and untrackable. It was a marriage license. I will never use UPS again.
"the ups is the most stupide carrier delivery , they have the most worst derivers and customer support ever , i would take usps over ups service ."
"UPS has got to be the worst company of all delivery. For the 5th and final time they stole my package. For 5 times they said that my package as been delivered. I never have seen any of the 5 package stolen by UPS. Here is the kicker I have security cameras from the second anything or anyone enters my yard it's on camera. For the 5 times that ups said package was delivered there is no recording of any drivers delivering my packages. Ups drivers either can not read a gps,map,street sign, or house number and delivered my stuff to some one else or they just stole it. I will pay more to FedEx then to ever use ups at least I would get my package."
Got 2 pairs of sneakers today and box came open with my brand new Nike vapors scuffed
The drivers do not pay attention to notes so packages are stolen. Very upset and I will never use them again.
"PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY!

I am the owner of the small business and UPS lost my 2 packages value of $500. I needed to sent 2 new packages to my customers out of my pocket.
I literally called them 55 times within the 2 months. Every time I would talk about 45-50 minutes with them, and their answer always was we will submit a request and we will call you next business day. That day never happened, so I kept calling them, and they were transferring my call to 5 different departments every time! I was waiting to receive my checks 1 month, never got them!

So ridiculous, rude, unconvenient and unprefessional!!

I will NEVER use this company again! This is a ROBBERY!

Besides $500, I lost probably 6 hours of my precious TIME on the call with them!

My personal advice to all of you business owners and consumers, try to stay away from this company if you want to avoid frustrations!

We all need to sign a petition to shut them down!!!"
"If I could give a zero star to the managers and supervisors, I would. Customer service calls are oblivious to what is going on but are trying from the scripts. I asked to speak with a manager. The rep asked me to hold and I heard in the background someone saying ""Tell them we are unavailable"". Oops, forgot the mute button. Ups has never been this bad. I don't have my most important package and they don't want to pay the insurance. Good look. I wouldn't recommend Ups to anyone ever again."
"Do not touch with a barge pole!
Paid for next day delivery to send a parcel to Italy and was received 10 days later!!
Shamble from start to finish….
Few hours after the collection the parcel was stuck 10 miles away, because I didn’t fill in an invoice (at no point I was prompted to fill in an invoice when I was online booking and making the payment). After sending this invoice (it took me 2 phone calls and an email), the parcel still doesn’t leave the depot for another 4 days, because the department hadn’t forwarded the invoice (the tracking system had been telling me it was in transit for the last 3 days, I wouldn’t have know if I hadn’t rung again) The saga continued with other issues along the way which involved many phone calls, loss of time and headaches…now they refuse to give me my money back and when I tried to argue back they hung up on me!!
Never again"
Delivered in time and beautifully weapped. I recommend
"Ups lost a parcel I sent worth £2500. They sent me a letter admitting that it had been last and asked me to send them proof of the value. I sent the invoice for the sale, what it would cost to replace and other recent sales. After all of this the maximum they will refund is £80. Absolute joke. Even admitting fault they still wouldn’t replace the item. How can a company lose something then decide how much they will pay you."
UPS accounts receivable (877-869-7502) is the worst of the worst. Outsourced call center do not know or cannot do the job. UPS hire the cheapest labor to not do the job. What's the point?
"UPS drivers are either stupid or don't give a damm about delivery of packages. Perhaps it is crappy management that don't give a damm and it passes down through the ranks.
Of all the deliveries we get, it usually is UPS that disappoints."
"The worst logistics company on the planet. Paid for 3 day shipping when it needed to be there in 5. It took 7. They did nothing to make it right and then threw their hands up and ""Terms and Conditions"" was the reason the couldn't give me a refund. Horrible customer service."
"COMPLAINT

So I live in Tennesse. Usually when ordering or anything that matters, there’s never an issue. Except for right now! So I have a friend of mine decide to send me a package for my birthday! She sent it out on the 6th of June. She has recieved the tracking number and sent me a picture of it so I can track it as well. So when I looked it up it was said it was in Chicago and the package was delievered on the 7th(my birthday). So I called up UPS and I talked to some guy who didn’t even bother asking “how can I help you?” Just asked for my name and tracking number. I bluntly had to tell him the situation and he asked in a rude way “How do you know the package is for you?” And he told me the package was for a guy named “Eric”! And said that my friend GAVE me the wrong tracking number! Who the hell is Eric? So my friend had called UPS and they told her that they will open a claim and do an investigation and let her know within 48 hrs. So days go by and no call from them! And she had to call them to tell her the claim has been closed. And she had the package under insurance. Still no answer about ANYTHING. So about 2 days after my birthday (June 9th) they send a text of the EXACT tracking number my friend sent to me and still says it’s been delievered! I YET still have NO package! Again I live in TN her receipt said my address in TN and they delievered it in Chicago! So my friend talked to a supervisor and asked if they could possibly mixed up shipping labels? And the supervisor told her there’s a possibility and he’ll check cameras and give a call back. So now up until today(June 16) we both received a call…mine was “A package for Eric was delievered” who the hell is ERIC?! and her was about the claim being closed and she will receive a check for the package, which is fine. She plans on giving it to me after she cashes it out. I understand all the understaffed business and what not! But people need to put the shipping label in front of the customer before they leave so they know the package is heading out to the right location! I will still be calling today to make a complaint cause as a reciever of the package I do have the right for explaination! Can’t they just find out who Eric is and have him send it back?!! Rude customer service! Very upsetting from both parties! Look forward to a mouthful! Oh, and one thing, my friend did suggest it asked to send an email picture of her receipt and they told her that wouldn’t be necessary! None of this makes NO sense to me whatsoever!"
"I had a package delivered that was open, completely open. I saw it on my security camera. The package contained two plastic containers of food. I noticed one of the containers appeared to be slightly open, but as I looked further, I realized the plastic security seal, not just the thin plastic, but the thick plastic band that goes around the entire container that you have to tear off, was completely gone. Someone had opened the container. I could live with this if it wasn't food, but it was. I've spent the past few days trying to file a complaint with UPS. I've been told repeatedly that the ""damage"" department would call me, but they never did. I filed a claim online, but once I submitted the claim, they came back saying it was submitted, but my photos which showed everything, were not. That makes no sense. I've always seen UPS drivers throwing packages around. I don't see this with Fedex or Amazon. Just my observation."
"Severely disabled level 7 highest social security disability goes. Have no furniture other then a bed. 90% nerve damage so problems standing and walking. Apartment complex where I live is so long that the office is literally a block away. When I get a call from the office stating U.B.S. tried ringing my buzzer, no answer so my package is now in the office a block away so a 2 block walk, which puts me in SEVERE PAIN! IT PISSES ME OFF BIGTIME!! I have their app, I see them pull up, I stand by the buzzer, stand by the door, NOTHING.. So in other words the driver lied. Too lazy to do his dam job and deliver to my door. Push 085 on the buzzer, it's the office, he gets into the building then lies. Wonder all the other packages people had to go get. Senior apartment complex. To lazy to do his job fire him and hire someone else. Nothing but reviews on here stating the same thing. Person not home, when their standing or sitting waiting all day and the person lied and never showed up! Then to pull that crap on disabled people."
"Don’t give your crap 💩 in the parcel to this company because until they will do the customer clearance it will start stinking globally and you will feel the smell from you destination country for the package, meanwhile they will put all the delays to government customs so that you will not be able to claim for delay. After your package will arrive minimum 7 days late and another 2 days it will stay in the destination customs after which they will deliver it to you but when you will open it you find it damaged and damage report will not help you even you do insurance like in my case as they will tell you that the package was not packed properly, however it is properly packed or any other reasons which they have in advance ready a lot in their rules. Customer service is sucks, they will never reply you on time , over the phone you will wait 20-30 minutes to reach their operator and in most cases local office will not answer you and you will call international contact center at your own cost and same will be there because there will be no other options to reach them. Anyone interested can contact me I ll share the communication and photos if required. Beware of this crap company!!!!!"
"try to avoid it at any costs.
The address was wrong. I've updated the address didn't work call 5 times to leave it at the center didn't work and after many calls and they told me the address is updated and for sure will be deliver to the right address but it was delivered to the wrong address at the end :("
"The worst shipping service ever. Do not even know if it is correct to call it service. I sent my international shipment on date 14 May and was scheduled for 5 days after, it arrived on the 16th of June (UK - Italy).

The receiver send them various emails asking the reason for this delay, and they said they needed ID documents for the customs clearing. The receiver sent promptly everything. After a week, it was still in the warehouse. I received an update saying that since I, the sender, asked the package to be sent to me (note I was not even in the UK anymore) and that they were gonna ship it back (I never asked for it and I did no wanted it).

After many calls from the receiver, they said again they needed the same exact documents the receiver already sent. At this point, the receiver got angry at the phone and after a short back and forth, they agreed that they made a mistake and that the package will be delivered soon.

After a month, an enormous amount of time wasted in call lines, and useless email reminders, the package arrived. Inside, there was a collection of butterflies, that was packed pristine, and arrived completely smashed, destroyed, and to be thrown away.

After having specified that the nature of the shipment was not commercial but due to relocation and residence change, they asked the receiver for an enormous amount of documents to have a free custom clearing. After all of that, I paid 70 euros of customs, over a total value of 90 pounds of shipment.

I tried to lodge a complaint, but the website continuously sends you to other pages and things to do, and I honestly don't have any more energy to follow these clowns.

Make yourself a favour, chose a serious courier and not these buffoons. They are extremely incompetent, unprofessional, and unorganized.

Their email is completely useless, their customer service is not coordinated between sending and receiving countries, and the complaint filing is a nightmare.

Honestly, please follow my advice and DO NOT ship with them. Chose another company, or bring them yourself with a horse and a carriage, it would be faster and less troubling.

I sincerely hope that his review will make them lose as many clients as possible, as they are the closest thing to a legal scam that you can find, and they truly deserve to be kicked out of business."
"The only contact I had with them was a text message from a mobile phone number, belonging to...who knows? In it I was asked if I wanted my parcel delivered to a shop quite a ways from me or have it delivered to my home address. I replied that I wanted it delivered to my home address. And I waited and waited. Looked at the parcel tracking, where it said that it could be picked up at ""Name of my Town...."". My town has more than half a million people. There's a lot of places where it could be picked up.
Several days later I contacted the online shop to hear what's happening to my parcel. And lo and behold it had been delivered to the shop, that I can't get to.
I contacted UPS the next day, and a nice girl, at customer service, said she would change the delivery to my home address, and that it should arrive on Monday... well we'll see....
How can all these small start-up delivery services be a thousand times better than this huge global company?? It was not my choice to have my parcel delivered by UPS and I will most certainly make sure not to have any deliveries made by UPS in the future."
"Unbelievably bad, when are UPS going to ever listen to their customers?
We actively avoid UPS when it comes to shipping but sadly some of the companies we work with use them, a 3 day shipping is now 17 days old, and no delivery date given"
I’ve been waiting for my package for almost 2 weeks now. It was on hold for 4 days and they keep changing the delivery date and time. I already called customer serving and all they tell me it to wait. Worst delivery company 👎
"This company is by far the worse of the delivery service industry followed closely by Pitney Bowes.

I place hundreds of orders through Amazon and each and every time UPS or Pitney Bowes are involved, my package either doesn’t arrive or is delayed unnecessarily.

Today, is Wednesday and my package was scheduled to arrive this past Monday.

For no apparent reason, they changed the arrival to Tuesday. I waited all day Tuesday, yet it didn’t arrive.The reason supposedly was because my apartment number was not listed. This is peculiar because I have ordered hundreds of items before through Amazon and most arrive without a hitch as my apartment number and buzz code is clearly stated on my orders.

Even if my apartment number is not on the packaging, the driver can easily look up my apartment number through my name which is listed on the lobby intercom.It would only take a minute or two, yet the lazy drivers cannot even attempt that. Secondly my phone number is clearly listed on the docket and a simple phone call would have solved the issue. I asked customer service why they simply could not call me, and was told UPS drivers do not have company phones! What a bunch of crock!

So now, it’s Wednesday and earlier when I was tracking my packages, it stated it was on its way. Well now it’s 6pm and upon tracking it, it now states my package is back at the sorting facility! Absolute inefficiency!

I called UPS and now I was told my package should arrive tomorrow (Thursday)….

These are brake parts I ordered and I suspect since it’s in two boxes weighing over 30lbs each, the lazy drivers simply do not want to carry these boxes to my apartment hence the delay…..this is not the first time this has happened with items that weigh over 25lbs that UPS has attempted to deliver…and the same issue (no apartment number listed) is the main excuse….kinda makes you wonder…

Anyways, if my package does not arrive tomorrow, I will simply cancel the order….as I needed the parts on Monday to complete my brake service on my van.

UPS is one lousy and inefficient company…I place it in the Mickey Mouse category…

Giving 1 star as there is no selection for minus 50 stars!!

Just my two cents…

Disgruntled customer…"
"Ups is the worst shipping company I've ever had the inconvenience of dealings with, they lost my package and told me three times that I would be able to pick it up on a certain day and they couldn't locate it when I arrived, asked me to put in requests for locating my package, which I put in two of them and the didn't process either of them, and told me I didn't pay duty fees, in which I did, and when I was in the office another man came in and they did the same to him. Seems like they have zero communication with eachother, zero care for there customer, and zero care for your packages. I recommend paying whatever price to just go through another company and not have to go through the stress the put me through, specially if you're ordering something limited and irreplaceable like I did"
"07:15hrs UPS app stated out for delivery “By end of Day”, waited in all day then at 17:12hrs the app says rescheduled delivery next day “By end of Day”!!! What a bunch of w-anchors!!! This is not the first time this has happened either. Why can’t these people send an email giving a 2 hour window like DPD and stick to it like DPD. Then allow their vehicles to be tracked to your door like DPD and give a countdown of your delivery number and tell you when you are the next delivery like DPD. What is the point of UPS having an app if it’s not updated and tells you next to nothing. I will never buy anything on line again where it states that UPS Is the courier. Oh and don’t waste your time contacting their “customer service” department to get a more accurate timeframe other than all day or a reason that the item hasn’t been delivered. English is not their first language and they clearly have no contact with UPS in this country other than the worse than useless information available on the app."
Was told that my package was going to be delivered within the day so I waited around but around the end of the day I got an email saying they said I wasn't available and they'll try again tomorrow!!! I was in the house all day waiting for them and I was some how unavailable!? Which is a lie. I could understand if they were unable to make it but to lie instead is just pathetic. Don't use. Awful company.
"Good job UPS.

Literally made up lies that they attempted to deliver at my home even though I have been at my house whole day literally outside and have yet to see any deliveries attempted. Now they're saying because I wasn't around they've pushed back the delivery date by another 10 days and instead I'll have to manually go pick it up. Complete garbage service and I will never understand why some brands like Logitech would ever pick such an inferior delivery service"
Very poor experience twice in a row. Received notice about delivery on the day / stayed home / package didn't arrive / tried changing the delivery address afterwards / website only returned errors / called support / chose a pickup point / package was dropped off elsewhere / finally managed to retrieve it
This whole company is trash. My package has gone back to the same carrier facility a whole two hours away for 3 days now. Can’t file a claim because it’s not lost but can’t get my package either it’s straight trash. I got a notification that my address was wrong even though the package I ordered 30 min before got delivered no issue so that’s just a big lie and then when I did update it which meant I have to go and make a bother stupid account that I didn’t want. And after the “address change” they said it’s undeliverable. Like come tf on. I seriously hate this whole company and their customer service is actual bs. All it does is enrage u worse than u started and leave u with no solutions WHATSOEVER!!!!!
"Poor service. UPS gave me a delivery date and a broad time span didn’t deliver.

Eventually delivered when I was not at home and left the package in a unsecured area"
"this is a complete horror, never use this mail, ever!
2 parcels were sent to me from Ukraine to Sweden. the first one was sent to the post office and they wrote that I was not at home. but I was at home and no one came. for the second one I received an SMS that I have to pay 100 crowns. I didn't pay, they sent the bill home, I paid and they sent my parcel back, I'm shocked. when they began to find out, the ups said that I was not at home again. but when they come they never call before. NEVER"
"“”The C.O.D. amount is missing from the label. We're attempting to update this information. / Your delivery will be rescheduled“

Apparently, the customer service told they attempted to deliver my package and nobody was home. They lied nobody came, no one texted before or notified and the worst thing of all they said that I need to pay additional $70 upon delivery. I haven’t experience this at all with DHL and Fedex. It’s the worst experience ever from a shipping company."
"After being notified that my package was being held for ransom, all I wanted was to pay my Import fees...no I don't want your app. No I don't want to sign up for an account...just a one time payment. How difficult can you make this? Holy cow...about as difficult as imaginable. After 2 hrs. of fighting with their webpage, I finally talked to an honest to goodness human on the phone and was able to make the payment. Then when the package was delivered, my daughter unknowingly had to pay for it again. Now the fight to get a refund. UPS has always been the most difficult courier service on the planet to deal with...even 30 years ago. Fix it!"
"still waiting for my package! I was home waiting for my package to be delivered. next thing I know I get an email stating the attempted to deliver my package. no honk of horn, no vehicle. my dogs didn't bark (they were in the house) I call bs! everyday they reschedule the delivery then nothing.... its been two weeks so far. spoke to the customer service department twice. hoping for this Thursday! nightmare!"
Every single time I have to deal with UPS it is the worst experience ever. Just when I think they can’t get any worse they manage to top themselves. The packages either aren’t delivered at all or they’re delivered extremely late. I have even had several times where a driver flat out lies and says they attempted delivery. I have watched the truck pull up outside my building and the driver sit there and then pull away. Then has the nerve to say they attempted delivery. I took a video last time and threatened to send it to the media. That was the only thing that got them to admit it.
"If I could give a zero I would. UPS, first leaves me 1 notice. But according to them their second attempt. I tried to go online to update delivery instructions my number on notice didn't work. Today 2nd notice, but according to them final attempt sending my package back. I had a heck of a time getting a LIVE person on the phone. Then I'm told that to hold at a location I need to pay? When my notice didn't work to update AND I only had 2 attempts not 3. I told them gonahead send the package back but I will NEVER use UPS again AND I will let everyone I know how horrible my experience was."
"just the worst delivery company ever. no information even when you set up an account, most companies can give an estimated time for deliveries but not ups and they have no customer services.
do not use them"
"Horrible. Reschedule NEVER work!. And 8 out of 10 deliveries, they delivery in wrong times than scheduled. And just for fun half of the time, when the package is almost at home, they simply gave up and say something wrong happen and they will inform later a new date!

Why this company still exist?! Nobody gonna miss them."
"If you don't want a convenient delivery, and want to have to hunt down packages like Dog the Bounty Hunter, then UPS is the service for you. Nowhere else will you find worse customer service, slower delivery times (if at all), and the rudest drivers in the world that don't respect your property. If you're a cynical b@$tard that hates absolutely everything, then I'd definitely recommend UPS for all your frustration-inducing needs. No need for a trash can, just ship things via UPS and they just dissappear! If you need to sign for your package, they will watch and wait until you're not home and attempt the delivery so they can just keep making delivery attempts so it looks like they're doing something productive, when really they've been toting around the same people's packages for weeks on end and calling it a regular route. If you want to be more pissed off than you've ever been before, I recommend UPS. Negative 999 trillion stars out of 10."
They driver is stupid he drop package next road to my house and then never show up to my house to drop package so stupid driver slow service customer service is suck also.
"Literally the worst ever, sent my package back after 3 delivery attempts which never happened! I was there in my business all days and I never even got a slip! Couldn’t get a hold of anyone what a hassle and a waste of time."
I have had two packages I ordered from EBAY shipped through UPS in Birmingham Alabama and the First package was delivered to the wrong address and had to be sent back to the UPS in Birmingham Alabama and the second package was supposed to be delivered Friday of last week but was delivered 3 days later
This has been the most frustrating experience I have ever had. I have had to spend more than 4 hours trying to connect with someone to help me . Every one says it is not their department and transfers me only tobe on hold again. Someone gave me a number thay said was a direct line to someone who could help me and when I tried the number I was told that I would Have to pay $3.85 to be connected. DON'T EVER USE THIS COMPANY
Purchase a courier service to get some parts shipped to myself in ibiza from the uk as purchased a new drive shaft for my bmw supplied by APEC long story short it broke after 2 months in ibiza. Tried to get parts shipped here from the uk was made aware the service would take 2days to get to me. That was a week ago and no signs of it arriving anytime soon. Absolute joke of a company run by monkeys. No help either whatsoever.
Quoted a price to deliver parcel which I paid to then find out from my bank they had charged me 4 times as much and to top it off they delivered my parcel destroyed a shambles of a company avoid at all costs
"This company coudn't care less about customer service. Nothing works, deliveries are not delivered as agreed, nobody knows anything, everything is always delayed. Avoid."
"UPS has messed up delivering my packages twice in less than a months time. They're drivers are liars! Making stuff up so they don't have to walk into an apartment complex to deliver a package. It's either you were home, or needs a signature, and this the best one yet ""refused"" why would I refuse a package i paid for???!! All the other excuses are lies as well because I work from home and they never attempt to delivery. I never have trouble with FedEx or Amazon. I'll stick with them and hopefully UPS finds reliable employees."
"To say I am irritated and upset is an understatement. After trying to deliver a very important document to me that apparently required my signature twice while I was at work, I called UPS customer service x3 and had to wait on hold for over an hour over the span of three days to get them to send my delivery to a local UPS location. Which cost me $7.99!!! And they can’t give me an ETA for my order tomorrow just that I have to keep calling to see if it shows up. Seriously this is the most ridiculous experience I have ever had with a delivery. If you can choose to not use UPS you could be saving yourself a lot of time and hassle. If my delivery wasn’t as important as it is I would tell them to return to sender and ask that the sender use a different company. SO FRUSTRATED!"
"I am constantly getting packages delivered to my house that are for other people. When I call to get them picked up no one shows up to collect them and they sit on my doorstep until I track the person down or deliver it myself. If I try to report it, my only option is to make claim as if I'm the person waiting for the package. Every time I call customer service I'm assured that someone be there soon to recollect the package. You obviously are not concerned about getting people their packages, UPS."
"I will never use UPS again. I own a small business and they have ruined 2 packages for my customers. I also spent over $50 for 1 day shipping to send a pie however, it took over 3 days to arrive to my customer and by then the pie was no longer good. No matter how many fragile sticker you have on your box they don't care."
"If I could give less then 1 star I would,this company is awful,I had to ship 4 items back to amazon,company picked items up on on June 9th,I realize no updates will be made available during the weekend but none were available on Thu or Fri either ,only update is label created plus ups never even left anything for me to track packages,in the past they did but not this time,I am appalled and hate this company with a passion"
"I live in Florida and had ordered something for my grandson who lives in Harrison Arkansas. The vendor used a combined form of shipment (which was unfamiliar to me). It used the USPS along with UPS.
I had to research my dates of delivery as they did not inform me - even though I signed up to be.
The dates were changed three (3) times.
My fault was I informed my 6-year-old grandson when he should receive it.
I contacted customer service who sounded as if they were over-seas. Unfortunately, I had to ask her to constantly to repeat herself as I was unclear on what she was saying. I wanted to know if this date that was given was exactly the date now - that it had been changed so many times. She seemed aggravated and rushed me from the line and said it would be there.
I got off the phone discouraged and thought about it and decided to call again knowing I would speak to another rep. The gentleman who took my call informed me of how the shipment was sent and how it works. He also put in a case to follow up on. He was a very friendly and willing to listen to my concerns and questions.
The same day I had a call from UPS in Harrison. I was told the package was delayed in another state for 3 days - & not knowing why.
He was very understanding as I let him know how my grandson was in tears that the package did not show up and to me very discouraging to keep letting him down.
The next day I received another call from the same gentleman in Harrison who informed me that they would be completing the delivery that day & without the combined delivery so that my grandson would get his package.
To my surprise - the driver came out of his truck to hand the package to my grandson (who was EXTREMELY excited and running to the truck) My daughter video taped the whole thing as the driver noted to all that he knew he was waiting for it. It was very touching. Wish I could post for all to see.
Thank you all for the extras - adding personal touch.
What started out poorly sure ended on a good note.
Way to go UPS!!

Sincerely,
Stacey P"
Waited all day for package they never showed up and then returned to sender saying I had rejected it WHAT? You never delivered
"Dear UPS your services are frustrating

First, you made a mistake in packing of goods, you sent my clients Goods to New Jersey and kept New Jersey's for my clients,
Secondary, you are asking my client to pay tax $ duties cost of a whooping $900+ dollars oa good worth N181,698 Nigeria Naira.

This is rather disheartening!!!
And Unbelievable!!!!
Kindly find attached a copy of the invoice for the package.

I regret every bit of this business."
Ups sucks I sent to packages to Puerto Rico they delivered one box’s to the wrong address and the second package they have on hold saying that the address was wrong which it wasn’t. Ups needs to hire people that take their job serious they deliver to where they want I spent a lot of money in what is in those boxes. I will never use ups again I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone now I have money that went down the drain? They need to hire people that take their job seriousups sucks they are pieces of crap They need to replace that cause those were for niece and nephew. Never again will I use ups I am giving them a bad review they suck!!!!!!
They cannot do their job a d the computer talks you in stupid circles
This is the worst place ever! Order from Home Depot and for the last 3 days they tell me it will be here... Still haven't got my order! I even ask if I could just go get it and they wanted to charge me to do that... REALLY! I will never use them again. FedEx delivered half of my order 4 days before it was suppose to be here now I'm waiting on the other half from UPS and can't even get it. How are they still in business?
"They just came to your house and tried to deliver the package. If no one was at home, they would take the package and asked you to pick up later. They never contacted the customer before they came. Those people just assumed you were at home all day long and not working. I would recommend them stop delivering those packages and just put them at the service center waiting for customers to pick up by themselves."
"UPS is suck when it comes to customer service, i tried to call numbers and used their VA.... my problem did not solve at all. I tried to ask for agent but their AI or VA is useless and it's not letting me talk to someone."
Drumroll my all time award for most incompetent company and poorest customer service is.. yes UPS!! They really earned this one. After losing a package that was supposed to be in their local warehouse 10 calls between myself and the shipper and talking to people in their customer service who did not have a clue including what time or day it was!! Overseas?? Lies from all no straight answers so I filed a claim. I figured if they saw they would have to cough money up they would get on it and find my package! Wrong!! More runaround and now now I am getting no status and they will now answer questions note says to contact shipper !! My good money paid and hours lost amount to 5 times contents of package and no resolution yet. No straight answers. Going over 10 days now..Great job UPS YOU JUST WON my ABSOLUTE Worse Incompetence Award for the year. I spend thousands of $$ shipping myself every year I will ship with UPS again thank you especially not anything for myself.
"BEWARE - 2 day shipping does NOT mean 2 day shipping.

It means 2 days from whenever they decided to haul their butts there and pick up the package.

I WASTED a BUNCH of money for something that is now useless to me."
"I have been waiting for a package for a week, the driver supposedly brought the package on Tuesday, but he never touched my hand, he left a piece of paper with a location where he supposedly left the package, but he never really left it, since I went the next day to the supposed point where he left it they left and it was not there; I called customer service in Spanish several times and everyone told me the package arrived that day; so 4 days passed; until the 5th day I check the tracking and it says that the package is being returned to the seller…….! What bothers me the most is that customer service in Spanish never did anything, and the worst thing is that I tried to make a complaint, but since I was not the one who sent the package, I could not do anything! SO THAT THE ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PACKAGE HAS NO RIGHTS WHEN USING THE UPS SERVICES! dedde today I will not let that when I make purchases they send me the package by this company"
"The worst company in the world.
They never care about customers .
I ordered something . They did not even ring my bell. Left me a paper with an address to go an pick it up. This notice does not have a tracking number.
I called them , I waited 10 minutes and a woman replied that I should giver her the tracking number. She insisted and I repeated there was no tracking number.
She hung up the phone to me . Very bad service, and especially rude. Never trust them.
This is the third incident I have with them."
"I was waiting for my parcel and was at home for the full day. Suddenly, I received a message from UPS: ""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer coll.""

They didn't even try to ring the door or call my phone number! There was no delivery attempt!

Now I need to wait again for an unknown period of time and pick up the package by myself. What's the purpose of the home delivery option then? Awful experience."
"Awful. Seems recently the people handling the packages for UPS are playing football with them prior to putting the packages on trucks for delivery. I had a shipment, clearly wrapped in fragile tape (2 glass bottles of maple syrup) and the bottles were so mangled the METAL CAPS had been crushed. Another shipment, of grain, crushed and spilled throughout the box, and it would have taken some serious carelessness to accomplish that. Seems some employees are taking their days frustrations out on our packages. I feel bad for the business that have to resend product because of the mishandling in shipping. It's amazing anyone can run a business with carriers like UPS."
"I ordered a package from a retailer arcteryx.com which uses UPS. I signed up for delivery updates from UPS but never received any! According to UPS they tried to deliver my package but needed security access to my apartment building: ""We are trying to get the security access our driver needs for this delivery"". They never asked for this information, or sent a notice about it - maybe inform the receiver about this? When I called customer service they said they had already begun sending it back to the sender. Joke of a company!"
"Always issues and hassle with UPS. Never with any other delivery serbice, just always ups."
Package missing. Customer service does not help. Ask me to find it myself or contact the seller.
"It’s been OVER 3 MONTHS and UPS has refused to resolve or take responsibility for a missing package. Very briefly, Package was mailed at a Boston UPS store. UPS “computer system” says the package was delivered “ hours” later to a NY address. Cameras confirmed no package was delivered. After telling them that I will provide camera footage, UPS finally states package was incorrectly labeled and delivered to address they had in their system, but they cannot divulge the address. UPS now says the customer has to contact the “shipper” , which is the UPS store where package was shipped for assistance. Getting no response from the UPS store and UPS Corporate office says “sorry, contact the Shipper, they are liable to you”. If the UPS stores can use the UPS name, why can’t UPS mediate to protect it’s name? Does UPS plan to be a continued viable option in the industry?"
UPS can SMD. Ordered a wedding ring and they rescheduled to where I wouldn’t be able to get it without my fiancé knowing. F*ucking pathetic pieces of sh*it.
"My package was just delivered to me.. and your UPS DRIVER SNUCK through my closed side Gate, past my pool, and INTO MY HOUSE TO DELIVER MY PACKAGE!! I’m shaking I’m so livid!!!!! How scary to find a man entering my home!!!!!! This was obviously not my front door!!! This was the Private gated SIDE entrance!!! Your people have no right entering a home!!!! WTH?! Completely Unacceptable!!!!!!!"
"Worst customer service ever
Next day delivery is a 3 weeks later delivery
Frustrated employees over the phone repeating a training written speech like robots with no solution no information"
"I am so OVER UPS!!!! This has happened multiple times to where I have ordered something and UPS fails to deliver on the estimated delivery date. Recently ordered a birthday gift and it is now officially lost! Trying to get a hold of a representative was absolutely ridiculous, the link that they had sent me kept giving me an error, and so now I had to file a claim that she said can take 5-8 business days so YAY! Now I probably won't receive that package or get the package at all. I get it, crap happens but I really hope this company gets it together!"
"Their tracker says its gonna be there at around 10:45 - 14:45.... i got my package at around 19:15.
another package im waiting for at the moment had the same time estimate, its currently 17:00. Not only that but their password requirements are fkn absurd, especially since the password reset does NOT work ( on their DK site atleast). The support said he couldn't help me with the password reset issue and gave me a a number to call... which turned out to be someone not from UPS, who told me he often got calls from people thinking he's UPS.

ALL I WANTED WAS TO LET YOUR DRIVE KNOW TO PLACE MY FKN PACKAGE OUTSIDE MY DOOR, so i can leave my house. WHY does it have to be so HARD to make you do something so SIMPLE?!

Your service is absolutely abysmal and i have no idea how you're still in business.

(This is not just a support issue and im not putting all the blame on the support, its just the entire system of your company thats so badly build up, that there's issues around every corner of the experience.)"
UPS guy insulted me the first time he saw me by saying “Get your skinny ass arms over here and help me” and talked about not jerking off. 10/10 would order from them again.
"Complete rubbish of a company, they ""lost"" my packages worth of 1k, filing a claim now which god knows how much time it going to take. Even though the customer service admitted that the package is lost, I keep receiving emails everyday about expected delivery, it's all lies, they ruined my work schedule with their lies.
their workers are extremely rude and have no decency, ghetto trash, they feel like you owe them something for delivering your package as if your property is a charity handed to you by them. I'm pretty sure they stole the package and label it as ""lost"""
Literally the worst shipping company in the WORLD they will tell you a date and push it back further and further all the time EVEN WITH FAST SHIPPING OPTION I hate it don’t know why retailers ship with them
Worst customer service ever no updates on package and still seeing package is on the way for over two days!!
"I have had a good experience over the last 7 years having a mailbox at UPS store 6184 on E. Bijou St, Colorado Springs. The current manager, Talia, is doing a great job. She knew my name by the second time I was there to get my mail and packages. Talia and the other employees that I have dealt with there over the years were helpful, efficient and professional."
"I just don't know where to start to voice my frustration at how horrible UPS is. Should I start at the constant late delivery times (both on delivery day and processing), the customer service that transferring me to the wrong dept. twice, or the staff that clearly hasn't had enough training as they had no clue how to handle my issue. Or maybe it should be their website that can't validate a perfectly legit residential address?

I honestly don't know, but I do know anyone I get shipments from I'm going to beg them to use ANYONE but UPS from here on."
UPS er det kun én ting å si om: This is not good at all.
"UPS is the only place that lies to get money. For 8 dollars, they say they tried a last attempt delivery when i was awake since 5:30am. Absolutely poor service and very bad response times. No one to answer the calls. I have had no good dealings with UPS including a lost gift, 2 returned packages and charged amazon returns (when clearly states that it is supposed to be free). Pathetic!!!"
I stay 5 mins away from them I got to wait to end of the day to get my package I will never in my life use any company that use ups cause the suck I then seen 4 fed truck come by my house I'll start using fed ex
They claim to have delivered my package but have not! What makes it worse is I go to call UPS and guess what I can’t speak to and actual person and a robot hangs up on me. So tired of these larger companies that o buba e no care for their customers at all.
The drivers are never on time and now that I can see their location I can see that they spend way too much time just sitting and they drive by my house a solid 4 times before delivering late.
"Fed ex is way way better, UPS suckd"
"Horrible service, deliverers and customer representatives. UPS as a whole is a joke. I have UPS my choice that fails me every time when linking my packages to the account, do not subscribe it’s a waste of more money and time. The drivers keep pocketing packages from my apartment building and lying about how or where the packages are delivered. When I tried bringing this to the customer representatives all I got was rude female dogs who can’t complete a whole sentence correct or stay on a line long enough to understand what is being explained. Do yourself a favor and use FedEx, USPS or any other delivery service besides dumb BS UPS."
Terrible experience with ups. They’re lazy and rude. They don’t use my doorbell or even knock on my door then have the nerve to leave a note saying “sorry we missed you” of course you missed me because you didn’t knock on my door or use my doorbell. Terrible delivery service!!!
"Worst tech in the shipping industry! Outsourced customer service that doesn't actually do anything. A voicemail that doesn't understand voice commands and tracking numbers you can't enter manually. Can't seem to find the idiot driver who delivered my package to the wrong address and a ""proof of delivery"" that doesn't give enough information for me to contact the business they delivered my package to but it still shows as ""delivered""."
The app is rubbish. As far as I can tell it gives no additional information or functionality. Can’t track my delivery apart from estimated 4 hour delivery slot; or make arrangements to deliver to a neighbour ( signature required).
"Horrible shipping company and service, they lost my package, service department did not make an attempt to find it even though they had clear clues where it was. Not able to get a refund since 60 days have passed. I will never recommend or use them again."
Arrived ahead of estimated delivery day again. Always impressed by how fast they move packages.
"Late delivery, damaged a package while it was in their care; delivered 2 packages out of 5, promised me that it would get delivered at the end of the day, did not turn up. Stayed late after work. And no one phoned back. When I phoned customer service the wait time was 45 minutes!! Now they tell me it going to be delivered tomorrow!!!"
"My shipment got stolen before it delivered :(
Even though my matter is urgent they told me it’s going to take 8-10 business days. My grades is going down because what happened to me. My shipment wad a (laptop)
For studying. I’m so upset."
"This has to be the worst run corporation in America! I've never had a delivery go smoothly. This time, my package was 5 days late and, because the driver could not spend 20 seconds to look at the names on the complexes mailbox, it was declared ""wrong address,"" just as I watched the truck drive away. When I used the ""correct address"" option on the website, I was told it was not possible for my package. I now have paid an extra $6 to drive over 20 miles to attempt to retrieve my delivery tomorrow."
"Ups your drivers need to stop stealing people packages. Today I witnessed my package didn't get delivered and my apt complex lady was in her office all day.

Only to find this package wasn't deliver, this is not the first time I have seem this happen. A ups lady came to put a flyer to the door without making attempt to deliver the package.

I ran after her and all she could say was sorry. You guys needs to do better mehhh"
"Worst service ever. They always mess up my order and delivers late. If I give store pickup the service there also is so bad. They don’t know anything about where my package is or why its delayed by weeks.
And horrible customer service. They just charged me $8 to pick my own package and yet the package was not ready for pickup when I went there."
"Honestly- why!
I had a shipment sent to my address. They dropped it off at a different address but then refused to tell me what address they dropped it off to. They told me to contact the shipper to confirm address.
The worst customer service"
"Great customer service and very attentive manager, Lenzel at the Edgewater location store #4614. Go get your shipping services done there!"
Always late. Packages arrived damage or unusable . Hate UPS to handle my product I order. This time it went from California to Jackson Mississippi to Tupelo. 2 extra days on my order. Why? Waste of resources… My package is now 1 week late. Should be here tomorrow unless they ship it somewhere else. Original due date was the 3rd. They always changing my information for God only knows what. So much for our plans to use it. Maybe next year.
UPS is the absolute worst delivery company! To think that USPS FedEx Amazon even foreign delivery services are way better than UPS. My package always disappears for a few days with no update on travel and the delivery date seems to always change to a later date. I dread when I noticed anything I order is coming via UPS I wish they didn't exist. Trust me I avoid using them if you have the option.
"UPS is just horrible. They lost another package this week. Please, do not ever use UPS. I am not sure how they stay in business, but I will never again PAY them to not deliver a package. Oh, and their customer NO-SERVICE is completely ineffective. They referred me to make a claim, and then their system says I cannot. So back to customer NO-SERVICE, who also cannot help because all they have is the same link.

If you work here, take a long walk off a short pier."
Yes my experience at the ups store was great and The cashier was very helpful And there where no lines so you didn’t have to wait and while I was waiting they were playing church music which I really enjoyed please continue to Keep playing church music in the ups store in griffin the store was clean I will be going back to visit again thanks again for your services
Ips is the worst place you can use to ship i paid for 3 day shipping 3 boxes delivered list 4th box . And i lost my contract with a company and liad due to ups F☆☆☆them
"I ordered a large parcel from Hong Kong from a company that I’ve always used and never had an issue with before. They always use parcel force. I receive a call the other week from someone asking for my email and something about a parcel, so I think what’s the harm? And give them my email address.

They then proceed to send me an email that honestly seemed like a scam from the errors, asking for information I’ve never needed to give before when dealing with customs. They also attached at the bottom an invoice for over £1000. I didn’t even know it was UPS contacting me until I saw the email. They wanted a “work of arts declaration” and a “reason for export”, I sent them an email back asking them to clarify because I genuinely have no idea how to answer that. They didn’t and still haven't replied.

Yesterday I called because I was starting to get worried about whether they had my package and there was something I needed to do to release it (like pay customs) and I was still on edge about it being a scam since there were so many red flags. I contacted the company I ordered from as well because I was supposed to receive a tracking number from them but still hadn’t, which was super sketch.

The person on the phone this time didn’t put my mind at ease at all and actually made me believe more and more that this was a scam. She was asking me how I would like to make the payment and I said that until I have some evidence that UPS even has my parcel I’m not paying for anything.

The company I ordered from got back to me saying that yes my parcel was shipped but that UPS hadn’t even told them they had got my package or even sent them a tracking number. They had to contact UPS to get me a tracking number. I paid for customs this morning and tracking says my parcel is out for delivery.

But Just now I received another phone call again asking for my email address so they could acquire information? I still have no idea what I need to do. There was yelling in the background of the phone call so I could barely hear, and the operator couldn’t get the spelling of my name correct so just decided to end the call. I’m still super on edge and haven't received my package. This whole experience has been horrible.

Edit- I received my parcel, and the minute I mentioned customer service to the delivery man he said “yep, it’s shocking”. If your own drivers know how bad your customer service is you would think that maybe you would make some improvements. Like, IDK, invest in some local customer supports officers."
Should have zero stars. Ups suck’s
"Never get my packages to me, the site is a mess that doesnt even work like it should. How are they even in business anymore."
"This company let me down badly twice and lack communication. They were not reliable and I found them to be quite incompetent.
I ordered a package from Switzerland and they ruined the whole experience.
I won’t use them again and wouldn’t recommend them."
"Terrible service from this company...even when they say they're going to be early, they don't show up, then change the time back to the original time of delivery usually the next day.
I work in Jax but live 1.5 hours away, I'm there everyday and home everyday, and ALL my shipments come from there, but hey can't seem to be consistent like I am.
I especially love when they're running late and they just leave the package at my gate in a bag, which I PURPOSELY left the gate open for delivery, and if I don't have UPDATES ENABLED to notify me then I'm waiting forever..."
"UPS IS TRASH, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOP; THATS WHY THEY WEAR BROWN!"
"Worst!!! This is the 4th package lost by UPS.. I ordered from Amazon, everything on shipping label is correct and this crap company can’t make a simple delivery.. I got the run around as usual, they said they delivered it to the right address, until I said I have cameras and you never showed up, then I was told the shipping label was wrong and they delivered to what was on the label.. This company is a joke.. fool me once shame on me fool me 3 times you suck!!"
"Unbelievably horrible! This is the second time they did not deliver to my address and left a note saying it would be at an access point. Went to the access point the next day and they had not received it. Here it is 4 days later and I get a notification today that it is rescheduled to tomorrow again pick up at access point because their attempted delivery there failed today. This place is not nearby, extremely dirty/grimey with infrequent hours. I had several orders from Amazon, that were split up - all carriers delivered on time - same day, except UPS. I spoke with the local driver today, that delivers and with all of his reasoning I pulled out the app and notification and he seemed clueless - when I asked Did you ring my bell? I wish I could stop all Amazon orders from being sent via UPS to me - this is ridiculous. UPS chat can't help. UPS outbound phone calls are not answered. UPS nearest location isn't open on weekends."
"i wish i could leave 0 stars. ups is 100% unreliable. i am forced to use ups to get my packages for my diabetes supplies and they are late ever time, even when i pay for rush shipping. i can not survive without my diabetes supplies and they are currently late with my package so i am forced to leave an old pump on which gives me a higher rise of infection that i can not fight off. overall, ups is the absolute worst."
"Worst shipping company ever. It is impossible to speak with someone without tracking # but the system doesn't recognize my tracking #, then they refused to open a clain and informed I go oline, I wasn't able to open the claim online do to the site down. Then you called get someone, the call gets tranfer multiple times then the calls ends and no one calls you back. I use them via Ebay and Amazon and NEVER again. I don't care if I am saving a few bucks, it is not worth the aggravation. I cannot believe I have to deal with this level of customer service in the 21st century in America unfreaking believable."
Always friendly and smiling.Ms Q always takes her time to make sure your needs are met
They have lost 3 of my packages. The app does not update to give the appropriate time that the delivery driver will be there if you have to sign for a package. The worst delivery service.
One Star. Make that no star. Package has been misplaced that was to arrive on Saturday. On Friday it was 2 hours away from my house and now for some reason it was sent to Mississippi. They now have no idea where it is located and can only say it’s on its way to me. To be delivered on time is why you’re paid and not to give excuses. This is not acceptable. I also spent more time than I care to filling out a form to receive notifications. Well..not the first one has been sent. I guess when they lose your package they don’t want to inform you in real time. You’re website for tracking is a joke. I got more info from Mercaris site where I purchased said package than your tracking site. How is that possible when that’s your whole purpose? Never again!!!
"This is not the first time this has happened, yet this was the last instance that happened a few days ago. The driver stopped in the middle of the road in a curve to deliver a package. When he didn't move, I honked my horn to let him know that there was traffic he was blocking. When the driver did get out, he looked at me and then walked SLOWLY towards the residence (that was probably about 50 to 60 yards from the road) looking at his phone. When he got to the door, he stood there and continued to look at his phone. In my impatience, I then had to drive around the truck using the ditch. This behavior was totally unnecessary due to the driveway was EASILY accessible. Not this instance yet one before, I have actually had the driver use a vulgar hand gesture and curse me as I drove around them before with the EXACT same circumstances."
"I have horrible experience, delivery guy never buzz my door. Without delivery my item he left. I had to pick up far from my home. They should change their system. Awful"
"UPS is a racist company that does not Complete delivery in brown neighborhoods. They literally sit outside for a few minutes in a brown truck and beep the horn for you to come downstairs and get your package. They only do this for 5 to 10 minutes. If you were not there when they arrive, they take your package back to an access point for you to come pick it up yourself! FedEx delivers to the apt door. Amazon prime delivers to your apt door. Post office delivers to your mailbox. But UPS drives Around in brown neighborhoods in brown trucks and expect you to come outside to get your package. UPS NEVER TELLS ITS CUSTOMERS THATS THIS IS POLICY!! It just takes the money and lies. That’s Fraud."
"Shipped airsoft gear from UK to CZ

Gear got stuck at UK for a month and something now.

UK UPS says they don't know where is the issue and can't do anything about it, so I should contact CZ UPS.

CZ UPS says they don't know where is the issue and can't do anything about it, so I should contact UK UPS.

Latest development was that after a call with very unpleasant (swearing) CS employee of CZ UPS I was told to contact customs department by email.

They can't create a ticket, they can't give me their phone number.

I'm never going to use this stupid company ever again!"
"Really terrible. My three month old daughter and I are stuck abroad owing to their inability to courier urgent documents needed for her travel to us. We are already four days past the delivery date and the package is still stuck in a sorting facility in Shenzhen. No customer service agent can provide an update since it isn’t in the origin or destination country. It’s absolutely appalling. Furthermore, they’re blaming covid and national holidays for the delays, all of which were known factors when determine the delivery date. NEVER USE UPS."
"Definitely the worst service I have ever come across. The entire structure of the company is fundamentally designed as a scam. Their customer service departments are located in irrelevant locations, no communications amongst them & no contact numbers so you can get hold of them personally.
Don't use it, IT IS A SCAM!"
"Absolutely shocking. I almost don't mind that they can't deliver my package (the one with a legal document to allow me to start a new job!), but what REALLY frustrates is that they're one of these companies who have successfully spent millions so that it's impossible to actually speak to anyone. No offence, but speaking to an agent in the Philippines who is reading from a computer script is next to useless."
"The packages will literally be coming from less then half a state away and it will take forever and the scheduled delivery time is all a lie. They almost killed the aquatic animal I was having delivered (Axolotl) by letting it sit in a hot warehouse for days! (They are VERY sensitive to heat) and you're lucky if you even GET tracking info because most of the times it will just say ""Will be delivered *insert day*"" and then will give you no tracking info and won't even deliver on that day!!! They just let your package sit there and just decide to deliver whenever or if they want to!"
"In the past year or two, I don't think UPS has delivered a single package to me on time. By ""on time"" I mean according to their own tracking. Yesterday I was expecting a ""scheduled delivery"" between 2 and 6 p.m. (according to one UPS page), and by 7 p.m. according to another. Hours passed after 7 p.m. with no delivery or update. This morning I was about to report the package lost, but finally received a new estimated delivery time: 4 days later. Almost as if it had never left the point of origin. Won't be the least bit surprised if it's delayed even further. How do they get things so wrong?"
"Suppose to receive my package Friday (6/03/2022 on the ups app was getting updates on my package loaded on the truck out for delivery then follow my delivery the driver was in my area did not show with my package driver went back to headquarters in oak creek,wi called ups then a lady from headquarters called me saying it wasn’t on the truck she said I would get tomorrow (06/04/22 Saturday I’m tracking the driver on follow my delivery driver was in my area said delivered did not get the package I was driving down the street saw the ups driver he delivered my package to the wrong address he went back to get the package he delivered it to me don’t need this stress I had a heart attack 5 years ago I was getting chest pains on Saturday dealing with ups"
"Worst Customer Service experience of my life. A very important package vanished from the local store. Countless calls to UPS Corporate as well as the local store I used in Santee, CA, over the last four months, and the same lies, the claim has been processed and the check is in the mail. No accountability whatsoever."
I hate this company. Was getting emails all week that my package would be arriving today from 2-6 pm. Address was correct. Spent all day home today. At around 5pm I check the site. Supposedly my address needs correction. I click the link. My address is correct. I go back to the site. Now it shows my address was updated and am ETA is not available. I call the 800 number to find out what is going on. The package cannot be redelivered u til the next business day which is Monday. No one knows why my address needed verification. No one apologizes for missing a day of work for no reason. No one apologizes for a second day off work on Monday to wait again for this package. I hate this company.
"I paid the sender for overnight delivery and UPS said that weather delayed it and customer service said “about an hour”. Nothing changed for 2 days, so I filed for an investigation, now nothing has changed except “investigation under way”."
So every time I order from Amazon and they use UPS....if it arrives late on Friday or Saturday morning I have to wait until Monday or Tuesday to get my package. They are so lazy they don't work on weekends. When packages are sent by USPS or FedEx I get them on weekends. This has happened to me 3 times now. I hate UPS. I will never ship anything with them!
"THE ABSOLUTE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE!
UPS and I have always had a BAD relationship. I buy items in bulk online to avoid costly prices in stores and most of the time the item will be coming from states just a few hours away (pennsylvania, Maryland, Etc) and it will take them days just to ship the item. After that it takes up to weeks for the items to arrive because of ""Delays"" that are never explained. But recently I ordered a cheap bed frame from the accursed Amazon because I'm in a pinch and it's all I could afford. Little did I know the package was coming all the way from communist China. I was told the bed would come on June 6th which is my b-day and I've already been sleeping on a thin mattress for 2 weeks now, suddenly the UPS tracking tells me the package JUST shipped and won't arrive until the week after because of.... you guessed it ""Delays""
Fk this company and the arrogant inner city people they hire. Ghetto and unprofessional too. Many times i've had blk or hispanic guys throw my packages onto my porch (caught on ring camera) shattering the items inside and filed claims and NOTHING was done. Go.To.Hell."
"I expected nothing and I got worst. They ""try"" to deliver to me 2 times but nothing at my door.. Nope First time :

""Delay in delivery due to weather or unexpected circumstances. ""

Next day :

""Delay in delivery due to external factors""

I waited all day because it needed a signature and the status only change at the end of the day. I waited 12 hours!

Worst carrier in the world!"
"Worst delivery service ever , gave them correct mailing address 3 times , and was told package was on its way , then was promised before 12 at a ups drop center , never happened , then promised a delivery before 6 pm , waited 4 hours never happened then called them and they said the address was wrong ? after talking to 3 people who all ignored my address changed ? then sent package back to shipper , totally incompetent , you couldnrt possibly try and be more useless than this company"
"I missed an order on Thursday 6/2/2022. While having a conversation with the delivery person through my RING camera, I advised him to please leave my package. He advised that he couldn't because a signature was required. The delivery person then advised that the package would be available at a ""pickup location"" Friday, and gave me the address. On Friday around 5pm, I arrived at the location and was told that my package wasn't there. So I proceeded to my home, and was greeted by a new ""sorry we missed you"" note on my door. This was shocking. I made an attempt to contact customer service. After calling the 800 number 4 times I got a human with a middle eastern drawl. I immediately asked to escalate to a supervisor. The supervisor advised that my package would be available for pick up before 8 pm this (Friday) evening at a location about 20 miles from my home. I drove to the other side of town to this location. Once I handed my 2 door tickets to the rep, I was told that my package ""should be"" available for pick up tomorrow (Saturday).
This was a lesson that needed to be taught to me. I will no longer buy expensive items online that require signatures to receive them shipped to my home. Shipping them to a department store is way less hassle."
"Never on time, cannot track packages effectively and have a don’t care attitude. Choose ANY other delivery service, they’ll be better than UPS."
"Called UPS to speak to a customer service rep because for some unknown reason, my package was rerouted to an access center. I advised the customer service rep. I would like my package delivered to my home address. The customer service rep. assured me this issue has been corrected and my package will be delivered to my home address. The day my package was to arrive, the correction was not made and my package was floating around in the UPS System. I have spoken to several customer service reps. and keep getting different answers. It's like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. UPS use to have exceptional customer service now, it is very poor. They may have more business than they can handle. If I could give 0 stars I would UPS needs to get their act together."
"Second time UPS delivers my parcel at a pickup point 14km away while I was at home.
Their customer service computer system is dreadfull,long and slow.
Tried to resend it with help of a agent, nothing happened and still have to pick it up myself. Where can I complain about the delivery(driver)?"
"I ordered a package that had to come from Columbus Ohio. I paid for expedited shipping so I could have it before I was traveling. The day I was supposed to get it, I did not. I checked to see when the package was supposed to arrive and it said in a week! UPS website said that “Due to the situation in Ukraine, your package will be delayed”. IT WAS COMING FROM COLUMBUS OHIO NOT FROM UKRAINE. Overall I was extremely disappointed with the service of UPS."
"Thiefs.
Ordered 2 small bags bags from Dior for choise, sent 1 back just to receive email from Dior that package arrived EMPTY! It was 1k worth sadle wallet.
Reading rewiews on Dior and especially here it's obvious disgusting trashy company with bunch of thiefs and incompetent idiot..."
Very quick and efficient. Thank you.
"UPS My Choice data is useless and cannot be relied upon. Tracking information presented to the customer regarding expected package delivery date/time is unreliable and out of sync with actual delivery status.
What's the point of providing a service that is not really helpful to anyone."
"They will not give me package and they stole my package and claim they left it at someone else front door. They want let me pick my package up at a local UPS location. They commits fraud I gave them my address and they are trying to keep my package.. This is unprofessional!
**Update**
Now they claiming that they are sending my product back to the sender. Not only that is the killing part the whole thing is that they have a updated address. I'm telling you if you a business owner do not do business with them. I have never experienced this long as I been in business. People pay their hard earned money to receive services from them and they will fail you no matter what that's what I get from this experience."
Every package I have ever received from UPS has arrived late. Never had issues with DHL or USPS. But always UPS. USPS and DHL always have my package on time (around 3-5pm) and with UPS if I don't get it at 9pm I usually don't get it until three days after it was meant to arrive.
"Worst company ever. Tried to use ColisExpat, but instead of giving the package to the guys, you were just like: nah actually we just gonna let him come to the pick up store and not even try to hand it to the right address. So I try to change the pickup store (what you don’t let me do) so I don’t have to drive to Paris, just because you are so lazy, never ever again, worst delivery service in the world

Update: called them to fix the issue, they did nothing but take 5$ for the call, where I got no help at all."
"They treat fragile packages like trash. Five out of seven boxes were delivered demolished. Submitted a claim as the contents are worth more than 10,000 dollars total and the claim was denied. Terrible service."
"Repeatedly sends packages back to the sender for no reason, unreasonably long wait times, just a garbage service in general. Use something else."
Lost my package and didn't even notify me.1 week later still saying it's on its way.
"I'm surprised that UPS has not improved their technology or services, I am currently waiting on a package that has been listed as being in transit on the delivery truck in Stratford for over 2 days. They're claiming to have the wrong street name/number so I created an account to correct any errors only to discover that the information was originally correct. The seller had sent me a screenshot of the label and she had done everything perfect to get the package to me. I spoke on the phone to UPS and was told that I should still get my package that day, (it's 6:55 p.m.) and to keep my cell phone line open for a return call about my situation and neither occurred! I asked the seller to use FedEx or the post office in the future."
My package was supposed to come in 2 or 3 days but was delayed please don’t use this app it will have you waiting impatiently for your package.
They shouldn’t even get 1 star. Companies shouldn’t use ups my son has a subscription for this clothing store where the send him a box monthly I believe and he was waiting on his box was excited about it too so he was tracking his order and it was marked delivered never saw a driver me and my other son were just getting home my son asked you saw a ups truck we live in a townhome I told him no he just marked my packages delivered we didn’t even see a truck and we took are time to look around for package nothing not at neighbors and everyone here knows everyone small little community of townhomes but nothing well it had to be the driver but when we reported it they did nothing they hire thieves and then ups does nothing my son paid money for his box stuff he works hard for just so ups can steal from him and they are lousy companies shouldn’t use ups to deliver for them and I read the reviews nothing good I hear they are a trashy delivery company and wait till I see a ups driver come over again I am comforting him and asking him if this is his normal route companies need to use fed ex because ups is crap just like the color of the trucks crap. And I am leaving this review cause this is my son that got screwed and I don’t like anyone screwing my kids over I mean no one I had to see my son deal with ups stealing from him. And ups needs to repay my son for the crappy employees they have
Stop confirming delivery when you haven't delivered! If you can't deliver it that's fine but stop lying and do your jobs its really not that difficult.
"was on the line for more than a 2 hours, and they hung up on me"
Ups is the worst carrier someone should buy them out every package is late by at least a day even for over night. They should have to reimburse you for the pricing they charge if they can’t keep there word. False advertising big time. Straight trash I hope Amazon drops them from there account.
"Wish I didn’t have to give a star, I paid 9.99 to choose my delivery date. I was giving a time frame from 12:15-4:15 once that time approach still no package. I called multiple times and was told someone would give me a call within an hour to let me know the package. No call.. no it’s the end of the day and guess what no package or no call."
"I am completely disgusted with this company. They give you delivery times with a live map to follow, and they pin the truck half a block away from your house to meet the delivery time and you look 10 minutes later and they are a mile away. I have watched this driver skirt around the block from 10:00am- currently which is 6:15 pm. My delivery was suppose to be at 11:15am I’ve reached out to the 1800 number and I’m told they have to follow a route. A half a block away isn’t on route?? Seriously give me a break.I will never use this company again for deliveries."
"I ordered a product imported from China at a price of 700kr. It was delivered by UPS. And UPS sent me the documents. The import duty charged was 1245kr. Wrong to edit the document to make a new one. Because of the Danish import law, the import tax is 38% and UPS has made a false document. Make an import tax invoice that exceeds the legal limit. The actual product price which is higher than what I actually ordered from China. So I have gathered all the receipt documents. They tried to deliver me the wrong document 3 times and they didn't correct it. And in the last document UPS asked to pay 365kr import tax. I already paid. Now UPS refuses to deliver and contacted me to original transport company. And UPS has stated in detail that I refuse to accept the goods. Even though I have already paid the import tax, the company has the payment slip but they are not responsible. Agree to edit. While UPS is liable for lost products and I gave UPS company import tax invoice and emailed them more than 15 times and now UPS loses product and does not refund import tax to Me. It is the most fraudulent and irresponsible shipping company. Please do not use this transport. I have all the documents. The company has submitted the assignment to the company's lawyer to take legal action. Very very bad i give 0% UPS."
"A package was sent from Amazon Germany on Monday to our small vacation house on a remote Aegean island in Greece and it arrived this evening in only three days, fantastic service."
"Ups is horrible place to ship from. They lose packages, you can’t get any live person on phone to help find packages. I dropped off Amazon return on April 25th and on June 2nd package not delivered. Went to store in Fairlawn with my receipt but they said it hadn’t been received in the Wadsworth Center but it’s been over a month, agent sent call ups that gets you no where. Will never use ups again this isn’t 1st time with this issue"
"all shipments have been rooted in from UPS.
this time I got the wrong parts, they called and solved everything by phone. was impressed.

but then the invoice comes again of course. and again one has to fight against UPS idiotic customer care.

steer clear of UPS"
Package didn't arrive as scheduled. 4 days of no updates and no answer but I'm sorry from the employee. Offers nothing as to why they don't know where it is. States 3-5 business days without realizing it's already been past that long. Sad
"UPS call center does not even offer a call back service and you end up staying on the phone for over an hour!

The estimated time for delivery is also never met and the UPS guy finally showed up after 9 pm when UPS states that their deliveries are up to 7 pm.

UPS needs a good overhaul from top to bottom."
"I hate this company so much, their website is impossible to navigate and I received no notice or updates whatsoever that several attempts had been made to deliver my package, no one even buzzed my apartment number any of those times and I also wasn’t told it would only be on hold for a week at a UPS facility that is nowhere near me, which makes no sense because there are several here downtown at walking distance. I had no way to pick up my package because it was so far and I don’t drive and when I called them they told me it was impossible to schedule another delivery at a more convenient time so now my order has to be shipped all the way back just to be shipped to me again, this package should have come to me in less than a week and now it’s going to take months because of this ridiculous back and forth"
"one of the worse companies to work with! bunch of irresponsible people , they should shut down their business. DO NOT WORK with this company. customer service is in another company who has NO clue about their job. offices locally do not answer calls or respond. no notes are put in the system and they lie about it. driver does not read any notes even if it is there. they do whatever they want and take no responsibilty"
My package has been out for delivery 5 days now and no one can tell me what is happening. Sad.
"Worst courier. After I paid all the necessary fee, the driver is asking me again to pay otherwise they will not deliver it. Called customer service to clarify things and they said i paid and ignore the messages from UPS. And my item is not delivered yet despite of all the calls i made. The driver put a message that they attempted to deliver and said they will not give it as i didn’t pay the fees where infact they didn’t even go to my place. Instead the UPS sent me a message to sign so they will not be liable if the item lost or what ever happen.The main culprit of this crazy stuff are the drivers.This is a complete scamming to the customer."
"Don't you ever send a package to El Salvador using UPS, they have charged so many fees on top of the custom taxes that is beyond ridiculous, over a. Month to get a small box with simple household electronics? Whatever company they are outsourcing is just not good. They made me pay 200 dollars to deliver my package. Almost costs as much as the products"
UPS Totally incompetent destroyed my item did not compensate customer service is a joke this company has the worst feedback I have ever seen avoid read their feedback
"I wish there was a way to give no stars. Absolute worst courier company. Ridiculous customer service, driver doesn't even knock the door or ring the bell. Just puts a sticker on the door and walks away. Lazy and inefficient company who probably doesn't care about the customer feedback."
"Have to use the website to change delivery details as they insist on only showing up while I'm at work, except the website crashes on login - and on password change, so can't change anything. Ridiculous that they can't build a working website in 2022."
I wish I could leave a zero they left my package the wrong address on the next block had me looking for then told me to contact the sender because there is nothing they could do about it I swear there full of crap
"Do not use them!!!!! It's the worst! why? Because they told me that they gonna delivery on last friday, and it didn't came. I called customer service and they promise they gonna deliver on this monday, nothing came in, but the tracking shows that it goes back to depo centre. I called the second time, they say oh we will leave ur number to driver and if he cannot deliver, he will call you. Nothing came!!!!!! and today, Tuesday, I called again. The new guy with super strong indian accent told me the driver cannot call the customer. And the parcel is back to depo centre again for 2 scans, it will send out within 24 hours after the scan. And i will receive the message. So it's been more than 72 hours, I haven't received the parcel they promised to deliver. Do nooooooot use them !!!!!!! The worst delivery service I had ever!"
"Really terrible service!! They turned up on the wrong day before the package was ready for collection, then told me I had to rebook for a fee of £15. On the rebooked day they didn't arrive. The customer service line is a premium rate no and is all automated so you can't speak to anyone. It really is the most rubbish service, don't use them!!!"
"Prompt service Uk to Aust
Only 1 less star as I had to check a few different places at my work as to where the goods may have been left. Until I checked my phone & noticed I could call up an image of exactly where the UPS drive left the gear"
"Why does anyone use these clowns?

I actually avoid buying from companies if I know they use this joke of a delivery company. Only one star as I can’t give zero.

Another order, another email and text telling me a delivery date, another day booked off work to wait for said delivery for it to not turn up and simply be rescheduled at the last minute.

Again and again UPS fails to deliver, not only the parcels you order, but their own deadlines. Dear UPS, don’t quote dates you can’t keep, stop lying to your customers again and again.

Time will tell if this parcel has actually been lost like the last one."
Worst delivery company ever!! Every time they deliver something to me it’s damaged. I will not buy a product from a company if I know UPS is delivering it. One star is being generous.
"A package was sent to me on the 24th. The sender omitted to write the apartment number. UPS didn't bother to contact them. On the 29th I contacted the seller and she contacted UPS to update my shipping information. After which I spoke to a UPS agent to find out whne they would deliver my package. They told me if would take TWO DAYS to add my apartment number to the address and because this was a long weekend, they couldn't tell me when I will receive it. Today is the 30th and I am still waiting. That is really bad service!"
Absolutely dreadful service. Customer service are a waste of time!’ Waiting on delivery for two weeks said we owed tax and duty but wouldn’t tell us the amount . Finally got a someone to confirm the monies owed on Friday was assured my parcel would be delivered today still nothing and still not left the original depot .been on the phone for 30mins now even after all day Friday !!!!!
"UPS delivered my package to wrong destination. Couldnt get any compensation, from UPS or seller. Will not be using UPS in near future, ever..."
15 of my packages have been waiting for collection for a week from the droop off point. Service below possible criticism.
"I give 5-star compliments to the store #6483. I use this office frequently and the service I receive is efficient, polite, fast, and they always present themselves professionally. Thanks, Branch 6483"
"They are such a fraudulent shipper, looted one of my package which contains more than $500 worth of goods. The package was lost on the way and no one in UPS could track it. Their website and customer care service is full of garbage, you can't get any help. At last, they agreed to pay $100 for the lost package. I NEVER EVER use UPS service in my life."
"UPS has been such a disappointment!! I paid over $100 to get urgent overnight delivery. They decided that they didn't want to deliver because the unit number was not included in the address even though they had to meet me in person to provide a signature for the delivery. Then i immediately update the address based on their instruction on their website. i.e provided exact same address with the addition of ONLY ONE number to it. Now they had ""everything"" they needed and the whole day to make the delivery. But they decided to postpone the delivery for three days, just because it was Saturday and they didn't want to get tired doing a job they were paid to do. So much waste of money, time and energy. They clearly can't do a job when it's most needed. What a Crappy Company!!!"
"Should Be ZERO! So I received notification from UPS that YOUR PACKAGE IS ON THE WAY delivery Sat May 28 Between 2-pm -6pm. I decided I would do a yard sale so I had my gates open and was out there all day. Much to my excitement I saw the UPS TRUCK come in next door. Then I saw him make a loop and turn around. I figured he was noticing the address was wrong but instead watched him drive away down the road in the other direction. I live next door to a Firestation who has the address on the street. I also have my address on the street on my mailbox and my fence. About 30 minutes later I got the ding from UPS that an adult needed to be home to receive and that I would not get my package tell Tuesday. How is this possible since I was sitting there all day and the Firestation was even home and oh by the way the driver never got out of his truck! This was a part for my trailer so now I’m out $353 total and $100 for shipping to UPS. I called the customer service number and after just repeating or typing operator several
Times finally got a person. He stated I would receive a call in an hour. An hour and half went by and nothing! I again called Customer Service spoke with Shane she stated the previous person never contacted the distribution center. She gave me a case number and I asked her to repeat back to me my complaint but it was totally wrong. She said they did not leave a call slip. I reiterated to her the entire story and asked her to send it verbatim. She said someone would be calling. Another hour and nothing, another 30 minutes to get a person Jill stated there were already two claims filed and she could do nothing. Distribution would call me Tuesday. What? First person to say this. Asked for a manager literally 20 plus times and they just keep repeating what is obviously in a script. Finally transferred to the American Customer service (another man’s words not mine) and spoke with Jess. I asked him where he was and he also stated the Philippines. He also stated there was nothing he could do and they would contact me on Tuesday. Another absurd thing is when I try and change the delivery date or location they want to charge me. For their own lies and inadequacy’s I would have to pay. Are you freaking kidding me!"
"My property is monitored 24/7 via security cameras. I was expecting a package to be delivered and my cameras show the driver arrive at the end of my driveway but never gets out of his truck. 3 different cameras catch this. Somehow my package supposedly gets delivered to my front door according to the driver(It was not). When calling UPS, no one is able to take the call or manage a claim. It all has to be done online as if everyone had access to the internet. No one here can track the drivers, no one knows what routes are given to whom. This company has come a long way only to be very badly managed. They better get their act together!"
"I have been dealing with an ongoing problem regarding packages being delivered to my address.
I spoke with an AXXXXXXX who said she was one of the managers at Hub Phone# 818-XXX-4939
She told me that UPS would not be delivering my package today and would be delivering it on Tuesday after I spoke with the UPS representative who said it was coming. You employee / driver RXXXXX HXXXXXXX in the past claimed my call box was not functioning when I checked that it was working with him that same day. The package was heavy and after speaking with him I was able to gather that he might not have wanted to lift such a package off the truck. He also reminded me that he had seniority now within his job to ensure me that he would not be in any type of trouble. That same day his manager called to let me know he would be dropping off my package.

So now Manager ""AXXXXXXX"" who refused to give me her last name said that UPS does not have to make a second attempt today to drop off the package and that they will be coming Tuesday the 31st. I am shocked by how unprofessional and entitled these UPS employees are treating me. It has made me wish to never use your service if possible. I know nothing from this letter will help me regarding your service but please know I have nothing good to say about UPS and I will remind others that UPS will let them down and to use anyone else."
"Firstly, the person handling my delivery was extremely rude and rough with my package - with electrical components inside. Then, when I go to discuss these problems with someone by phone, I can't even reach someone. I got a callback, to have no one there. They then go on to immediately give me a survey on the representative that wasn't even there! I attempted to call back, and then don't even have the option to get a call back anymore. This is the most bs company I've ever dealt with. All this doesn't even care ver the number of times they delivered elsewhere."
The driver was nice but he tried to deliver me an empty package. This is not the first time ups has screwed up deliveries i genuinely don't understand how it is still in business. Late and damaged packages are the norm it seems.
UPS is by far the worst carrier. We used to use them as a company only to experience high damage rates and consistently late shipments. It has come to the point that I will not order products from companies that use UPS because of the lack of reliability.
They handed my package to som random person at my address I was the only one home that day and I never received the package so they had a signature but what’s the piont of that if they don’t check if it’s the right person I’m losing 500 dollars because of the problem they just make sure they hand the packages to the right people instead of being lazy I’m really mad that I’m losing that money because of one ups drive that couldn’t deliver the package to the right person
Every other order says can't deliver and goes to post office. There is always a problem and they can't deliver on time. Package makes it across country in 2 days then sits in local delivery for 3 days. If it all possible I don't use ups.
"Useless, promise a delivery date and don't deliver. No update online. Phone and promise to get back and don't. Deliver on a day that their web site says that the package is still in the depot.
Same problem on three occasions. In my experience they are the worst of all delivery companies."
Put in an order on the 20th of this month the item I was supposed to have was supposed to be here by the 26th it’s now the 29th and they’re telling me it’s going to be the 31st before I receive the item and all their updates that they had or super slow and then it said it was out for delivery two days ago and I’ve yet to receive it and when I got in touch with them today they told me it’s still in the warehouse and it will not be shipped until Monday which is the 31st will never ship nothing else with UPS again
"If you want a package lost, UPS is your company.

And no, they don't care."
Pay over $120 fir overnight delivery and they take 5 days. Crap company and should go bust with amateur service like that.
"Pure crap! First, they said they tried to deliver my package, but I was at home at the time and there was NO delivery attempt. Then they told me it was at a pickup place about 2 miles from my house. I'm 74, and have had a stroke, so I took the bus. When I got to the pickup location, they had no record of the package. This is a three-day weekend. I can't go back to the place until next Tuesday. Bah! I won't buy from Deep Discount again unless they use a different carrier."
"This will not be constructive or positive. If I could give a negative rating I would. It has been so difficult finding someone on the other end of the line that knows how to solve a problem. I have been waiting for this package of photos to make a memorial video and they tell me they tried to deliver an hour ago, no truck came in the parking lot today nor did anyone try to open the door. I've been here for two hours. They can't seem to find the tracking number or my address for that matter. I'm so angry I'm cursing. DON'T EVER USE THIS SERVICE. They couldn't find sand in a desert!!!! I was just informed that their drivers do not carry cell phones so all they have for contact is a pager, what a waste of time. Their 24 hour service is meaningless, the person who sent me the package was told they legally have 3-5 days to deliver rush packages. REALLY? A $60 service with a loophole they don't tell you about. USE LOOMIS!"
"Absolutely no customer service! I ordered the package delivered to a third party pickup spot so it would not be left out on my front porch. UPS turned the delivery over to a ""partner"" delivery company ingnoring these institutions and you can't even file a complaint! So unprofessional!"
Worst worst worst company I have ever dealt with. They lose your package all the times. Then when you are trying to track it down they are all clueless. Even though you pay the C.O.D it won't show up as paid so then they don't let it at your door cause they don't know it's paid for. Then it goes back to the warehouse for another week and calling the techs they know NOTHING about what is going on. Please save yourself the headache and use a different company!!!!!!!!!
Y’all are a bunch of morons. The worst delivery service known to man. My package was in the town I work in and I couldn’t come get it because there was a delay but wouldn’t say what for. Y’all just need to go out of business. Everything y’all do sucks. I want my package and now the usps doesn’t know where it is. Bunch of morons work at ups. It can’t be that hard to scan in and out packages.
"Wow UPS you suck really back. I get a notification saying you attempted to deliver my packages. Bull I have cameras and the 2 times you said was attempted was 8.25am and 10.35am I was mowing my lawn no one came.
Then I called customer service took me 25 minutes just to get a real person.
The lady said the delivery guy never made an attempt to deliver my packages. So if thats the case then why in the hell would you say you attempted to deliver my packages?
I wish there was something we could do to bust your A** for lying saying you did something when you didnt."
Worst delivery service of the bunch. Their otr drivers are more cognitively impaired than Joe Biden and their route drivers can't make any deliveries on time.
"I placed an order with Amazon, recieved a confirmation from UPS that my delivery date would be that friday. Then I recieve a new email from UPS Stating my delivery has been rescheduled and wouldn't be here till the next Tuesday because of the holiday weekend. So now all the plans I made are out the window because UPS couldn't hold up their end of the deal, even though my package arrived in my town about noon on that Friday. The customer service person I chatted with said they technically had 3-5 days before they delivered my package. What a bad display of greed over customer service. and they are going to hold my package in some warehouse for 4 extra days."
The customer service number does not connect me to any associate.
"Horribles.....el repartidor vociferando y un trato pésimo.
Una mafia."
"Genuine worst delivery company on earth. Emirates Post, a local company, can deliver from Europe to UAE in 4 days (normal rates paid 14-28 days expected delivery), UPS charge 88 Euros and can’t deliver in 8 days with EXPEDITED SHIPPING.

Go locally. They are a joke. Even may have to go to the DEPOT TO COLLECT BY MYSELF IN MY OWN CAR.

Apologies for the rant.

Customer service are extremely helpful but the company as a whole is an absolute shambles."
Worse service ever! Use fed ex
"If there was a way to leave a -100 review, I would. UPS is the worst carrier in existence. They always mess up deliveries but what’s worse, they lie consistently. I am on the phone now because they have in the system that I refused a delivery - which I did not - and the representative said that the package never left the main hub to be delivered. This is after I called and talked to a representative earlier who assured me it would be delivered - because it’s food! It can’t be delivered tomorrow. This is the umpteenth time UPS has lied about a delivery they have lost or stolen. I’m done."
Package was to be delivered on the 25th and tracking never loaded any details. Now after complaining to ups and company purchased from it will now arrive June 2nd. This company has turned into a big joke. I’m finished purchasing from companies that use them to ship.
"They don’t deserve a star. UPS is VERY VERY VERY HORRIBLE. The UPS driver drove up to our home look over at our house sat in front of the house and then drove away without delivering my package, Knowing full well that I sat at home all day waiting for that package because they don’t give you a drop off window. They just say your package will be deliver up until 7 PM. I called customer service and they told me your package will be delivered at the end of the day which is 9 PM. I then check my tracking number and it says IT WILL BE UPDATED. My tracking was then changed to the next day. I’m running a business and can’t afford to not get my package when I pay to receive it that day."
I missed intercom call from the driver by 2 minutes. He was already gone when I came downstairs. I have called Ups customer service and they told me he will come back the same day. He didn’t show up. I called them next morning and they said they put the note it’s urgent and I will receive my parcel first thing at the morning.. I called them twice that day and… the driver did not show up at all.. I took day off to make sure I will be at home when he show up. They ruined my day. I don’t think they even care.
"UPS (Universally Poor Service) absolutely stinks!!! Their app doesn’t give correct updates and their total attitude is that “we just don’t care”. They are cheap for a reason, poor everything! The delivery times sent by text or email are an absolute joke! You can always take the latest time and add 6 hours and MAYBE get your item by that time! I’ve been lied to by drivers and the complaint process is a joke BUT businesses use them due to the cheap rates. I’m at the point that if I order something and it has UPS delivery, I won’t buy it no matter how bad I want/need the item. I HATE UPS!!"
UPS never even attempts to deliver my packages to me. They just report that they tried and then drop them at a location a few miles from my house for me to pick up. I never even get a sticker or anything on my door.
"If I could give zero stars, I would! I hate UPS so much, they way they deliver packages doesn't make sense at all. It depends on driver's mood I guess. Sometimes I find packages outside of my apartment complex, sometimes they get delivered, sometimes they don't. How a company this big can be so disorganized? I was expecting a package today, and found a note in mailbox ""sorry we missed you"". What did you miss? My mailbox? I don't even need to sign anything for this package. And all other packages from the same company got delivered, so how DOES IT MAKE SENSE?"
The worst courier company it’s really really bad you should learn from DHL
I received my parcel in a very good condition and at a scheduled time. Thanks a lot for your delivery and a full information about its track.
UPS driver makes no effort to redeliver packages. Tried once and then even said that “addressee refused shipment and said to send it back”… Total lies. Absolute worst shipping service ever. Constant lies about making second and third attempts (I have a Ring camera). If I could give negative star ratings I certainly would. Horrible and useless 1-800 number that offers no help whatsoever. Avoid UPS if you can.
"Absolutely the most incompetent and pathetic shipping company on earth….even worse than USPS!

Lost a $1k package, claim process took 2 months which they closed out without ever contacting the customer (me). The multiple calls and excuses yielded NO results. The manufacturer of the shipped item stepped in and sent a replacement item (they actually offered) and are now handling the issue with UPS directly. I can’t say enough about Horn Blasters (the items manufacturer) and their amazing customer service.

UPS on the other hand is a joke. Their FAKE APOLOGIES are evident by their incompetence and lacking communication. It’s probably a result of COVID though….SMH."
"Shietist delivery service known to man. The inconsistency is wretched. First it was supposed to be delivered today in the morning, then 11am-3pm and now by the end of day. It won’t let me sign for my package online, the customer service chat is useless because they “don’t know anything” (their words) and when I called to ask if I can sign for it online, luckily I’m home on time but often I’m not so I needed to sign for it if it was to actually come during 11am-3pm, the thing said I’m 6th in line and should be connected within 7 minutes, it was 30 minutes later and I was still on hold. I’ve never had a good experience using them."
Just got a 19.5kg parcel received from France today. Full of glass and porcelain items and all got to me safe after only 5 days with no issues at all. Thank you UPS
"The incompetence of the company is mind-numbing. My package was tagged as ""Incomplete address. No such address."" In both cases not true. It is now a week since the delivery was scheduled to arrive. Nothing. 5 days ago I actually spoke with someone at UPS. She told me they had ""fixed the problem"" and that I would have a delivery the next day. Nothing. One other thing: if you call to speak with an agent you are quickly referred by the automated setup to the website. This company deserves to die."
"Out for delivery yesterday Tuesday(which was the delivery date), but I guess they couldn't make it in time so it went back to the facility. So with that being said I expected delivery today. Nope! Went from Illinois to West Virginia overnight 8 hours away. They're so quick to send it off elsewhere. I probably won't get my stuff until Friday or Saturday, if I'm lucky."
Their company and customer service people are filled with liars and cheats. They say one thing and lose your package then they claim they “found it” and will send it to you in 2 weeks time. Then it doesn’t show up and they say they lost it again. Then they say fill out a claim and they send a $100 check to replace a package worth over $4k. If you ask me they’re just thieves who steal people’s packages!
"I paid for the fastest possible delivery to home. I had not left home even once and I even brought my laptop near to the entrance to hear a car arriving and the doorbell. Nothing. I checked the tracking and It claimed ""the customer was not home"" which is completely BS. I was there, and nobody came to our door. They are sending the package to a pickup point from which I have no time to pick it from. I paid extra to get the delivery fast because I need the package for my travels. Now I will need to pay extra to get the same product in the country where I am going, and there is no guarantee that this can even happen. They had all the details and they could have called if they did not find the right place."
No time for delivery . One week ago delivery at 9:00 very soon . But another day i wait in my house all day no delivery . I lost my work . Fucck off
"Driver will not knock or ring doorbell, this has happened on numerous occasions. I will get the notice to pick up the package at a local auto parts store. I have a disability that limits my mobility, so I requested to have the package re-delivered to my residence. In the notes I even put ""KNOCK OR RING DOORBELL"", because apparently delivery drivers are unsure how to do this. When I had contacted UPS customer service, I did advise them of my mobility issues, the response was ""oh sorry, you're package is ready to be picked up at the access point"". This is one of the most useless ""delivery"" companies out there. Thankfully I didn't have any life saving medication sent to me because I'd probably have to go to the magical access point for them"
"I received a text from ups that I thought may be a scam. I called to find out if I missed a delivery as the text stated.
I wasn't sure if we had something coming so I didn't have a tracking number. There are no options in the menu to speak to a person. If ups can't be bothered to have an operator option I can no longer bother to ship with them."
package lost. what can I say
"Ups , driver didn’t show up to pick up a package and said they didn’t have a buzzer number when entering my condo there is a display of my apartment number with my name and a bell to ring my door ! Ups didn’t try very hard!! My apartment number is the same number as my ringer !!! They rescheduled me 4 days later just for the driver to tell me that they can’t print out waiver bill when I spoke to a supervisor the first time they didn’t appear they had no reconciliation of what’s going on, worse customer service ever !!! I highly don’t recommend! Just pay a bit more with another courrier and they will get the job done ! NEVER GOING WITH UPS EVER AGAIN !"
"No response to complaints whatsoever. After insisting I pay nearly 26%in additional charges before they would give me my goods, I spent 14 days trying to get an answer. No return calls or answered Emails until I emailed CEO's office, after which they ignored the question just suggesting I use their app for more up to date information on deliveries? In the end I had to pay as I needed the goods to finish a project. Extortion. All in all 3 day delivery was 17 days and 26% more expensive."
"I'm not sure why all these reviews are so bad, because we have the best driver. Madey R. is one of the best UPS drivers we've every had. He is always friendly, always helps us with returns and NEVEREVER complains. He was on vacation for a week and we were afraid he left, but he reassured us today that he will be with us for 3 three years until the next bid. Thank you for being Awesome Madey!!!!!!"
The worst experience ever with the customer service!
UPS just delivered a metal print that I ordered. The end of the box was ripped open. UPS has a history of delayed deliveries and damaged items. It’s like they do not care how they handle items.
"Drivers leave my orders at the gate thrown on the ground and don't drive to my house inside the open gate. I pay extra for speedy delivery and I know your driver are paid very well. I have lived in this place 22+ years, I'm 81 years young and don't want to search for my delivery. Also most drivers come to my house but today the package was on ground😩"
"DO NOT BUY A MEMBERSHIP. TOTAL RIP OFF. Had to leave town at the last minute when a package was arriving in a few days. Packages are constantly being stolen in my building and this order cost me a lot of money so I bought a UPS membership just to get my package securely held at a UPS location until I returned. They did not tell me they only hold packages for a week and then will return to them sender. If I knew this I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT A MEMBERSHIP. What a total scam. When I called customer service to ask if they can hold my package 2 extra days they refused, I asked if I could send a friend to retrieve the package and they refused this, they refused to deliver the package as well and said it will just be returned to sender if I cannot pick it up myself within a week. I am so incredibly angry and disappointed in their lack of customer service. Even the USPS has better policies than this."
"One star is too high, if possible I would rate UPS zero or give it a negative rating. My package, which was a large oil painting arrived from Spain so damaged it is now having to be returned. The canvas was torn and three out of the four corners of the frame were badly chipped and/or dented. It had clearly been thrown about with little regard for what was inside even though it had FRAGILE plastered across the box.
The box it came in was damaged but I had no opportunity to point this out to the driver as he left the package on the doorstep and drove off, despite requiring a signature for it.
The package itself was held in a warehouse for over three weeks with no information provided about the reason, other than waiting for 'customs clearance'. I paid the customs duty (a random amount, again with no explanation about what it was based on). When I wrote to HMRC and asked, they informed me that once duty has been paid the courier needs to deliver the package, there should be no waiting for 'customs clearance'. Phoning and emailing is futile, you get no meaningful response from anybody and as for the CEO Davit Scott, don't bother with him, I don't even know if he really exists. if he does he does not have the courtesy to respond to emails, even though it is his name provided by customer service queries.
I can honestly say that I have never experienced more shoddy service from anybody ever, let alone from a well established international company. UPS is obviously complacent and doesn't feel it needs to improve it's services judging by other reviews I have read.
The gallery who employed their services are currently in the process of complaining and I now have to wait for the outcome of that before I receive my money back. In case anybody from UPS reads these reviews I will provide my tracking number so you can see the string of emails and phone calls I had to waste my time on during the period of over three weeks when my package was sitting in your warehouse at Stanford Le Hope.

"I have not received my package yet. UPS claimed that they passed by the house and we were not at home. But we were three people at home. Noone rang the bell.
They did not leave a notice of passage!
I called them to let them know that I needed the package urgently. The driver was almost laughing at me.
I found it to be intolerable."
UPS is enjoying all the Payments of Amazon Prime shipping and using the excuses to hide behind. We've had 4 drivers work our area. The first three did very well. The latest one misses deliveries all the time. Prime deliveries that are 1 day now take 4 days. FedEx delivers on time. If Amazon wants to continue to be a thing they need to pick a better carrier until UPS gets its act together.
It's been 5 weeks. $800.00 item. Can't track my package. Can't file a claim. Can't speak to anyone. All i can be sure of is that they have no information and theres no way to investigate further. Im convinced their website is built to make people angry. I've been through this before with ups. They're the worst of all delivery companies and it's not even close.
My package was supposed to be delivered between 2pm-7pm today. No delivery at 7pm. I 'm watching the door like a hawk and received a notification stating no one answered the door and they will try again on Monday. I'm beyond pissed. No note or anything was left because these clowns didn't show up. Get out of the business.
"What a joke of a company, 2 times "" delayed in transit"" (not the first time)
Without any explanation."
"UPS rep literally would NOT tell me what address they dropped my package off at. It's my package and they told me they were not authorized to tell me. So, first off, the package should have been delivered through my ups account directions to my front door and they have the gate code. I called in and they said I don't have an account with them. I then check the website and they have actually erased their accounts---WOW! But even after giving them the gate code and instructions, they never delivered the package. So I see it was signed for and left at the front desk. Our building doesn't have a front desk, and no one could have signed for it.

I don't use any companies who ship with UPS anymore. But one company, this is all they use and every time UPS never delivers packages to my building. UPS sends messages to the warehouse for instructions to the driver and to warehouse management to call me back and sort this out . (We also gave the route driver a key to the building, so there are no excuses to screw up the deliveries). But the warehouse managers never call you back and AI keeps blocking you from even being able to call a human on the UPS phone number about your missing package. It was here 4 days ago, and I still don't have the package, I absolutely despise UPS. Everything should be done the way amazon does it. I can see Amazon coming down the street on their GPS map. I will have to buy my items from a vendor who uses USPS or amazon at this point, because this cannot continue. UPS used to be the best and now they are a complete MESS! The bottom line is, they probably were too busy to drop it where I paid to have it dropped at, and they dropped it at a delivery center. That's the new trick. They say they missed you, drop it at delivery center miles from your home and then you have to figure out how to get it. Catch a $20.00 Uber roundtrip to pick up your package because the drivers are too busy or (lazy) to go to your address."
"A complete mess. Poor communication and no guidelines. I was supposed to receive a completely innocent 6x10 bubble envelope with an ID at a cvs. The most simple thing, right? I went there about 4-5 days after the package was scheduled to be delivered. They said they never got it or they wait 2-3 days and send it back to UPS. I called customer service and After a robot asks me to tell him the long af tracking number which is impossible I finally get a hold of a representative and they tell me I need to file a claim. This is a complete waste of time. What if this was something important. What does UPS expect us to do? Find a needle in a haystack all our own?"
"I am interested to know why UPS executives have chosen to work in the field of logistics since they seem to know very little about it and seem to actively avoid getting packages into the hands of their customers. I have spent a tedious hour trying vainly to pay a duty fee via a glitchy website/app that displays two different prices, multiple sign-ins/lock-outs, poorly designed submission forms that aren't mobile friendly. My only concern is for UPS's frontline staff that have to spend their days apologizing for the baffling decisions of their paymasters. It must be demoralizing work that drives one to drink.

My only hope is that these above mentioned executives must run through as many hoops as I had to to complete a simple transaction to get into heaven when they die. That, in my opinion, is purgatory enough."
"Where in the hell has this company gone to seriously every time I have a package delivered by UPS there’s an issue. Not once is there something where there’s no problems. They deliver to the wrong place, the package never comes, they pretend to attempt a delivery the list goes on. It’s sad you can’t really choose what company is used to ship your stuff because UPS is not it. They’re getting almost as bad as god damn FedEx and that’s saying something."
"UPS and FedEx are both the same when it comes to scamming people with overpriced overnight shipping that doesn't get delivered next day.

UPS put my overnight package on a train from Michigan and expected it to be delivered the next day? Hell it wasn't even near the HUB in Charlotte for me to pick it up, it's still in transit at 10am. Are ya'll seriously that brain dead?

They know right away it's not going to make it in time, shipping it as a 2 day package that is half the cost. Doing this to thousands of customers a month would net hefty gains at the expense of our hard earned dollars and energy better spent elsewhere for inept services.

Your shipping network is a garbage heap."
"This is quite possibly the worst company I've ever dealt with when it comes to shipping. I paid $55 extra to get a package next day delivered, and took the day off work so I'd be there to sign for it. I was giving as a very special gift not only would I not receive the package on the agreed upon day, but I couldn't even get refunded the $55. I hate the fact that at times I'm forced to use ups if I had my choice I'd use this company for absolutely nothing. Thanks ups for ruining a very special day, and keeping my funds at least for the time being I hope you're proud of your ""company"". They couldn't even give me a reason for the delay, they put some poor soul in a call center on the front lines to take the abuse while the cowards who run the MONOPOLY hide, and rake in millions."
"Just hope your delivery date don't fall so close to the weekend otherwise expect delays. They are fine any other day it seems. Took a whole day to go from being scanned in to being shipped to transit one state over, it also went from one town over to a whole state over. The whole process was quick as I was tracking it except now that it is Friday there are now issues funny how that worked out."
They keep trying to charge me for sending my package to a access point. Just leave my package at your location so I can pick it up. People work during the day and every other carrier does not charge for anything like that. Every company needs to stop using UPS to send customer orders. I will go out of my way to shop with businesses that do not use UPS
"HELLO does anybody run this company or do you just let the monkeys run wild in the zoo because whom ever is running this company into the ground and can't teach there drivers simple delivery skills should be fired when did it become normal to leave package and not ring doorbell or knock I for will ask from now on if the company uses your service because I will not use you ever again two weeks your so called delivery man gave my 500 dollar tablet to a worker in my driveway didn't ask for ID nothing then lied and said he delivered I to front door intellectually challenged
you people need to wake up or your company is going to go under I am done i will never use you again good luck with the new job looks like your going to need it and don't even try to blame this on covid last I read covid doesn't make you stupid. Shawn"
"UPS sucks. They claim I have a dangerous dog, and I witnessed a driver strike my dog in the face with his hand held device due to my her barking at driver. Now I have to watch my dog with ALL delivery drivers because the UPS man has taught her that delivery drivers are dangerous. They lie and claim I wasn't home or my road was flooded so they couldn't deliver. Then they leave the package at the terminal and don't even try to come again or contact me to come and pick up my package. I wish I could get relief from law enforcement due to the driver's action but my dog is a pit bull and you know how these nit wits feel about them. Do not do business with anyone who ships UPS, that is the only way we are going to get anything done about them."
When I see a store using UPS I don’t want to buy from them. Imagine everything you hate about a delivery companies and you have UPS.
Thought was a decent company promised Friday that was before they sent package around country . Tracking doesn’t refresh. Now they cocked up now have to wait until after weekend before they try delivery . Very poor service
Paid for ups ground shipping and was shipped to post office where I can’t pick it up. Plus can’t get my money back for the upgrade. Wow what a shame stealing and wrong place to be delivered.
"UPS being an international company, i thought they would be professional. it's filled with people who cannot even communicate in simple English. Their customer service is a farce. They don't have access to any systems, nothing. The team that handles border clearance is uneducated and care a damn for customer service. They are never in sync with the customer service department. THEY Speak like they rule over customers. Never ever send a parcel through UPS. They're the worst."
"Gotta love when you wait on your porch all day and never see a UPS truck and send you an email to say they failed to reach you so you have to now go to a pick up location in another city. To makes things worse, there’s a UPS pickup location a 2 minute walk away but yes, they picked a place that is a 20 minute drive away for me to pick up my package. The package was addressed correctly, required no signature, and I live on a street that’s easy to locate.
Oh, and I can’t get them to re-deliver to me or to that closer pickup location near me unless I want to fork over $6 or $7. So I have to pay for that delivery driver’s actions.

I work at a call center and now I understand the pain of customers who call to beg us not to use UPS. It’s a pharmacy based call center and a lot of these customers are low income and disabled. Shame on you UPS, your system is not friendly to me and it’s absolutely horrific for those struggling.

I’m lucky I was able to get a ride to get my package. But what about people who can’t do that? I was given only 5 business day to pickup my package before it would be shipped back to sender. 5?!?!? Seriously. The pickup place was only open 10-5 on Mon thru Sat, in an absolutely shady “tax” business. So if you have to work all week, I guess you are out of luck.

So cool that your employee never made a delivery attempt, and there was only one delivery attempt. From there I have a limited time to pick up from the pickup location a whole city away. And the alternative was paying for re-delivery (and I guess if the employee neglects that would I have to keep paying for more re-deliveries?)"
"One of the worst delivery companies. Poor customer service, and erratic and inaccurate delivery notifications. Had a parcel rescheduled twice at the last minute after making sure I would be at home to receive it. Now on to reschedule number three. Customer service have not helped at all."
"Totally appalling! Especially UPS-Malaysia - does not take responsibility at all. (1) On board 3 boxes from KL to Sydney on 22/3. 2 boxes arrived and 1 according to them went missing and and they wanna compensate RM$200 NOPE! goods worth RM3k.
(2) UPS-MY opened investigation and closed it within a week said it’s loss in transit in Sydney. Closed case. Washed their hands off.
(3) Wasn’t happy. We wrote to UPS-AU. They said the box is still in Malaysia hasn’t landed in AU.
(4) Back to UPS-MY - they said now loss in UPS-HUB in Shenzhen. Question- how can a big box go missing WITHIN UPS own Hub?? Unless it’s stolen by internal UPS staffs due to higher cost of living.
(5) Asked for proof of scans etc. They provided some but weren’t happy and not interested or bothered with client.
(6) Wasn’t happy! Wrote to UPS-USA (as was about to put a very bad review but can’t find their google 😏😏)
(7) UPS-MY closed the case and that stupid 3rd party courier company can’t and won’t do much 👎👎
(8) We didn’t wanna accept the claim nor close the case and then miraculously the parcel appeared & was signed by “Erika in Kirribilli” on 12/5. Not bothered with the courier or UPS-MY so we...
(9) Called and wrote to UPS-AU - why our parcel was delivered to “Erika in Kirribilli” !!?? The customer service dare not say anything but insist the case was closed refer to UPS-MY. Nope, we pursued. We also suspect that UPS internal staffers must have seen a claim was made and case closed so someone nicked it.
Note - the claim was made by UPS-MY not us!"
"UPS have consistently delivered on time, take great care with the packages they deliver, and their staff are always very friendly and courteous.
5 stars from me!!!"
"I’ve had nothing but grief with UPS. I receive a package every month for medical supplements via UPS. I pay a delivery fee so it’s brought to my home. I’m always at home, and the last 3 times, I received an e-mail stating I wasn’t home and the package was delivered to a pick up point. As I’m always at home, especially the day of delivery by my intercom phone when I’m given the delivery 4 hour window. When I called to complain, a customer service rep apologized and promised she would have the package to me the next day. Next day came and no package, so I called again was promised again it would be delivered to me by end of the day. I also asked to speak to someone who can take complaints and I was told, they will call me back. Before I could say anything, the rep hung up on me. No phone number taken for a complaint call back. I’ve run out of supplements and I still have no idea where my package is. Unfortunately, the pick up location doesn’t open at a convenient time for me arrange a pick up. I’m so frustrated with UPS. They are the worst delivery company. I’ve never had issues with purolator. If there was a way to give them a zero rating, I would."
SERVICE HORRABLE THEY SAY MY PACKAGE DELIVERED AND NO PACKAGE AND THEY NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE PACKAGE SAY DELIVERED YET I NEVER GET MY PACKAGE DID THE UPS WORKER TAKE MY PACKAGE
"The driver ONCE AGAIN LIED that he called with the delivery, saying no one was here. We WERE HERE THE ENTIRE DAY. We have a call box and the driver does not let us know he's here. UPS does this CONSISTENTLY. They never deliver to us. They LIE. Now we must wait AGAIN tomorrow. Waste yet another day. Waiting. UPS IS TERRIBLE."
Horrible service. I had an order that was partially delivered in April and I still haven't gotten part of my order. As well as the stuff I got was damaged. I have attempted to file multiple claims but the website won't let me so I have resulted to emailing them multiple times with no response. Unfortunately I have another order with them and it has been delayed as well. I would recommend to steer clear of UPS as much as possible because of multiple issues with my orders with no solution or response from them.
I will never us this place again. Cost me a thousand dollars to send a package that wasn't delivered and they don't care they just give you the run around so I will take my business to FedEx. This place is a bad place to send anything expensive. Cheap package made it but evidently someone wanted the expensive package. I would never recommend this place extremely poor service Extremely Bad place.
"Terrible service. Never on time. On a package that requires a signature, I received 2 notifications via email stating the package will arrive, first by 11:45, then by 1:15. At 3:30, I called customer service. They stated the package would arrive by 7:00pm. In this world of technology, I would expect better accuracy on knowing where and when a package that requires signature will arrive. Especially one worth over $1k. FedEx is better by a mile."
"Right miserable pair of drivers,not friendly or polite like all other carriers I use,I pointed out that my package was split open and contents hanging out underneath as one of them walked up my path,all I got was a look,and he walked away,should get another job if this one isn't suitable!"
"I placed a claim for a lost package over a month ago. At that time, they verified they lost the package. It was not insured - so covered for $100. I now had to spend time verifying costs, trying to fill out UPS forms that didn't work, locate tracking#s, claim#s, user#s, etc. - none of which could be found all in one place. Once all this is done, no response. Do it all again. Then 'missing documentation' message. Once I contacted BBB I received a response, and that a check was sent to me.....The original $100...and to the WRONG address! Really worth all my time dealing with this."
"UPS in Barbados has had my parcel sitting at their depot since the 3rd of this month (15 days n counting). the parcel was due to be delivered on the 5th. all now we still waiting on clearance, no updates on progress given, no info on what the delay is about or how much longer it will take to finish(or even begin) the customs process, and also no delivery date! phone rings out when trying to call for information. and when you do get through they aren't bothered about your goods, the time, money or injured parties involved. I will NEVER use this courier service again. i'm hoping to God that i dont get the 'lost in transit' nonsense now!"
"THEY LOST A PACKAGE WITH DOCUMENTS THAT WILL TAKE 3 MONTHS TO REPLACE BY VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES. AFTER SEVERAL UNSUCCESFUL ATTEMPTS TO GET THRU TO AN AGENT I PROCESSED A CLAIM THRU THE WEBSITE. AFTER A WEEK I RECEIVE AN EMAIL THAT THEY ARE CLOSING THE CASE BECAUSE THEY CANT REACH ME.
THEY MADE NO PHONE CALLS
THEY SENT NO EMAILS
NO ONE GIVES A DAMN
WORST DAMN SHIPPING COMPANY!"
"Dealing with UPS on my most recent shipment has been depleting. The urgent documents are lost in transit. I've spoken to four different people this morning trying to get charges waived for the missing envelope, the last person saying I just needed to give the billing department some additional information to get the package sent. They just transferred me back to the main menu where I continue to hit a wall. Very frustrating."
Waited in all day 17th May for delivery then told at 22 15 no delivery
"$70 undisclosed ""customs brokerage fees"" for $9 of actual customs, holds package hostage and threatens to dispose of it if I don't pay. Garbage scam company."
Want to ship a small package of ammunition in accordance with the ups limited quantity rules to my son. Seems that although their rules say you must ship from a customer center. Have stopped at the williston vt center during advertised hours and no one is available. Tried to call to get help and ended up in a automated loop. Web site says if you call one of their motivated employees is ready to assist you. What bs. They need to update all their information to state that they are no longer providing direct service to potential customers.
"Very bad service. Unreliable drop offs in Portugal (""he should come one of these days!!"")
They lost a package and told me so. I had to order a new one. After one month they said they found it and so I was not entitled to any compensation. But I couldn't get money back on the new order.

Their customer service is atrocious they just read of a script and don't want to help you.
You really feel helpless. Please avoid."
"UPS is absolutely HORRIBLE. Bad tracking. Finding help from their customer service is disaster.
No one is able to tell you the exact status of your package.
They keeps on updating rotating the same information on the tracking reference, and as anyone can see, after 2 weeks of my package being at UPS UK, they keeps on saying the same things.
I contacted them everyday, as a sender, but unfortunately they were not able to give me details about my package.
The receiver also contacted UPS UK, and they requested more details about the items. Hence, information about all items was provided, but nothing change.

YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY REPEATEDLY UPDATE THE TRACKING NUMBER WITH THE SAME INFORMATION. AS YOU CAN SEE BELOW...

Service is terrible, it was not the first time I had trouble with UPS in Spain, their specialty is the no show of the driver, who then says he did ring the bell but nobody answer. The result is you pay for a express office delivery, and you end up with a delayed pick up to their office.
My last claim is about a package that come from UK.
I paid for a 3 days delivery, and after 21 days, I don't have any f***** informations where is my parcel and when it's gonna be delivered. They are saying that it's custom check, and that they need information from your comapny, which I supplied several times, but nope, not enough..
If you have a business and need a reliable delivery , PLEASE don't use UPS SPAIN EVER !"
"I purchased a product and received a tracking number that indicated it would be delivered Friday, May 13 by 7:00 pm - it did not arrive. I Enroll in UPS My Choice thinking I would see the latest scan of where my package was, stupid me, it gives you no further information than if you just tracked the package with out it. After contacting them the then changed the tracking message to "" it will be updated"" and that stayed that way for over 2 days. Now it indicated the package should arrive today May 16, but still no further information about where the package is. UPS My Choice is totally useless, don't waste your time even enrolling. They have no clue where your package is or when or if it will ever be delivered. They also wouldn't let me file a claim even though they had no idea where it was. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHAT SO EVER."
Delivery date is always wrong and when it's not delivered it just says it's going to be delivered everyday until whenever it eventually is going to be delivered. Fedex doesn't do this and usps doesn't do this. I can only try but avoid companies who ship with ups from now on.
"On two occasions packages delayed until Monday when UPS tracking app says out for delivery for Friday between 12:15 - 4:15 & rechecking app on Saturday morning says rescheduled for Monday! It appears the packages are being misrouted to the wrong delivery truck & sent back for reprocessing!

Inquired & no creditable reason given! Use another reliable carrier like FedEx!

Based on me frequently checking the UPS app & following the computer scanning of the packages."
"Ups is not a major provider in Greece, actually the worst i have used. No notes left, info in the website regarding the parcel's tracking not accurate, site no user friendly. However, if you get to actually speak with a representative on the phone, solutions can be found."
Ups said my package was delivered and I never received it. This is the second time they did this. The first time they told me the put it at the wrong address. The customer service was rude and no help at all. They don't want to look for the package they said contact the shipper. I do not recommend ups!
Absolutely terrible. Bad tracking. Inability to get packages to their destination on time and when they do finally arrive half the time they’re thrashed. Finding help on the website is a disaster and real humans are harder to find than a unicorn.
"1ZA8T1970347097785
Just had the best experience with a UPS delivery ever. Great driver and customer service. He needs a raise and praise!!! He went out of his way to get our fragile product here safely and in one piece. Very special man!
Thanks so much.

"Kal and Tim went out of their way to help box a headboard to send back to Amazon!!! They were professional, efficient and so friendly!!! It is true customer service!!!"
"Tracking fails to locate package or provide estimate. Virtual assistant is useless. Over phone, the virtual operator does not understand clearly enunciated tracking numbers and keeps mis-hearing single digits, then puts you in an endless loop."
"We ordered a rush shipment for a youth baseball team. The order should never have left the United States. It was to be UPS 2 day Air. It went from Arizona to Kentucky, To Harrisburg PA (our driver works out of there) and then went on to Canada. Since then, we have been told it was in security as a suspicious package (it has t-shirts in it), it would be shipped out and should arrive in 2 days (3 times now) and have found out today that it is out for delivery... In Canada. Regular customer service can't handle the call since it is now an international issue (again, should never have left the country) and International services obvoiusly can not follow up with promissed emails, call backs, or delivery times. This issue has gone on for 3 days and they are now telling us that we have to fix it online... why wasn't that said on DAY ONE. Either these people have no clue as to what they are doing, or they want to blow smoke and blame everything on everyone else while doing the least amount of work possible."
Our parcel has been stuck at their warehouse for the last three days and cannot speak to someone on the status.
"Hopeless organisation when things go wrong. We received two shipments of goods from Italy and we were charged duty on both occasions which is contrary to the Brexit agreement. I have sent some ten emails to their so called post clearance and billing departments without response. I have tried to phone and keep getting transferred from pillar to post by agents based mostly in Asia with a very rudimentary knowledge of English and when I finally managed to get through to the department responsible for the error, I have been cut off in midstream. This happened several times, so it’s more than a coincidence. There is no one in the organisation that will accept responsibility. Last year we sent a small consignment back to our Italian suppliers. The consignment was in a depot close to our suppliers. We were advised that delivery was on the way but this did not happen and eventually, after some eight months, the parcel was returned to us. We had spent over £20 on the shipment and our suppliers over 100 euros in charges and we have been unable to get any refund despite many approaches."
"Same experience as usual. Rubbish service. Waiting for our goods for 2 weeks now.. All custom information UPS requested was provided 1,5 weeks ago, but still no delivery or reply to the e-mails. Avoid this company."
"UPS is a shocking ripoff, that doesn't give a damn about customer service. When you ask for an explanation of why they're charging double the amount of tax that is due, they simply ignore your emails. Wouldn't touch them with a bargepole after that."
"What a rubbish company, do not use UPS unable to deliver to my customer sent next day signed for, after 8 days my customer was still waiting, so decided to ask for his money back contacted Indian call center to have parcel returned to me, long story short it took 24 days to get it back, what a joke, if you use ups you will regret it."
You ask them not to pull big truck in driveway they do anyway when u call make complaint they rude. I also have video
"Terrible service and extremely expensive but they can't give me a clear and logical reason why my package has been delayed just "" we're sorry your package has been delayed it could not make it on time""
What a joke. I have paid 55 USD for VIP service and it is just so unprofessional.
No tracking information, no update at all if I didn't call I would never have realized my package was not arriving as I was expecting."
"Courier delivered to my building and was rude as i was doing my job. I work in hospitality and understand the day to day mechanics. But what I don't understand is why take it out on someone working the same field as you. Courier delivered to my building and as we have marble floors for stairs, in the past UPS couriers have brought the hand truck down them and ended up chipping it. Now as a result we don't allow them to come down. As i was telling the gentleman this he snapped and told me "" I work this building everyday, I know not to bring it down the stairs."" I normally don't work morning so I'm just doing what's asked of me. UPS do better cause it makes no sense to attack someone for doing their job. Or passing on info from management.."
Avoid at all costs... these are amateurs... disgusting.... got £11 out of me and didn't get parcel posted...rude courier.. very unprofessional...
"If I could give no stars I would, UPS have ruined my Exhibition. I have tried to send some shipment to Amsterdam in good time for my arrival, paid all the extra costs for a fixed day delivery, I ensured I put all the paperwork in the envelope. It is almost a week later and the exhibition is over and my shipments are yet to arrive. Countless emails, calls to customer services with requests to talk to a manager about my complaint and many extra copies of documents sent and still they keep sending me emails for more information.
This company has no customer service or organisation skills. If you value your small business do not use UPS."
"Absolutely insane the UPS system and a delivery!! Everytime when I order something from Eindhoven to the UK! Always late my package,ALWAYS!!! Today 9:45-13:45 it’s not 16:22 in the afternoon!! And another big question is where the UPS driver leave my parcel??? Where?? Because I can’t find it!No picture,nothing!!! Delivered but where?! Insane !! No information on the website juuuust delivered it’s the final result! I’m Never ever use this company again! NEVER!! I will be Promise!!!!"
"UPS driver delivered my package to someone they thought was me, at a location other then my home. Then they lied and said I picked up the package from their truck. The irony is I have been home since Oct 2021 due to a medical condition and was not the person they thought retrieved the package.The driver lied and the UPS Supervisor laughed at me when I explained my situation. Getting someone in management is difficult and I can’t get resolution through normal channels. Time to take legal action.

Would not recommend using UPS for any deliveries."
"Absolutely dreadful service, chased and chased my late delivery was told every time it will be with me before 7 pm on each day even guaranteed verbally will be here tonight, and guess what still no delivery!
Will never use these again as long as i have breath in my lungs, they just need to be honest and i can work around problems
Just please tell the truth and cut the lies lies lies lies lies lies lies"
"I will never use this service again, totally disappointing. My package was not picked up, then suspended and after lost. Delivery date was suppose to be 25th April and today is 11th May and I am still waiting."
"There are no ""zero"" stars otherwise will give that. This is the third consecutive year that whenever I schedule a pick up with UPS the driver shows up after calling them at least 3,4 times and after taking 3,4 confirmations from them, Last year i talked to a manager as well but nothing changed this year. I will never do any business and I always suggest my clients, friends, and family don't do any business with UPS. i am complled to work with them because my employer has a contract with UPS. They are the worst people on the planet to work with.If i have this sort of staff i will fire them and will put them in jail so they will not ruin any other businesses."
UPS has gotten terrible! They are slow and their tracking is awful. They want you to sign up to get tracking info and then they never update tracking. Terrible service!!
"UPS used to be so reliable. Now you can't even get in touch with a representative without tons of automated prompts. Then only if the auto promt reply deems it necessary. Once you get a live person they will only read the info you already have available to you and no additional help. UPS mail innovations is even worse because you have to go back and forth between them and the post office to eventually find out if the package is lost, your only recourse is to contact the company and get a replacement and wait all over again hoping it isn't lost again."
"Very bad logistics coordination and tracking. I have not come across any other logistics company of a similar size and international presence that would have a similar customer service quality and delivery standards.
Problem 1: Delivery updates on their tracking page are not prompt and up to date, estimated delivery date keeps getting delayed and postponed.

Problem 2: Customer service replies around 1 business day but they do not resolve issue, they repeat whatever information you can see from the tracking page, despite requesting them to intervene and check further if the package is lost in transit or can arrive on time.

Conclusion: Reconsider ordering from any merchant if they uses UPS as their logistics partner, suggest to use others like Fedex or DHL, at least they do not keep shifting the goalpost (eg. Delivery date)."
"Title useless parcel service
This is what ups should be called purchased a new pair of boots they were sent out for next day delivery they did not arrive so I contacted the seller who told me ups had sent the parcel to wrong destination and the didn't know when they will turn up so I have made my mind up to give one more day then demand my money back needless to say in future purchases if useless parcel service are the couriers I will not purchase but will purchase from a different trader who use a proper delivery company"
"The most most disgusting, most irresponsible company I have ever heard in my life Never, people never use this service. I ordered a product from Spain to Holland and waited for it for six days. But I never got it because I left Holland. The same thing happened in Belgium! i hate you b/tches, be damned you all!"
Worst customer service and late deliveries. No real time tracking no way to contact the delivery person they dont even call or knock on ur door before delivering the produxt. The customer support is the worst part they are in hurry to disconnect the call even if u ate trying to get a solution and on call they just try to push u to disconnect the call by repeating one thing that they dont know anything and cannot help it. If that is the scenario than what is the use of customer support if they cant say anything.
"Out for delivery going on the third day. Apparently the package is on the truck to be delivered, but the driver doesn't deliver. Don't put out for delivery on the tracking information if it's not going to be delivered that day....."
"Worst delivery ever. They claim to attempt to deliver, but I registered no attempt. UPS does not allow scheduling, does not try to contact customer, does not offer enough information in the tracking page. For adding a delivery note with instructions, you need to create an account with a registered address in the USA, so sorry europeans."
"Worst Service Delivery EVER!

Drivers don't even ring the bell and they claim the delivery ""failed"" - what are you supposed to do? stay outside your building the whole day waiting for them? Cause they see the main door to the building is (of course) locked and don't know how to use a f bell?

Then you establish a new delivery day - confirm it twice - so you can take home office (because they deliver in the middle of the day - why not? it's not like people have lives) and guess what? they deliver on another day. Just because."
"Returned my item to sender with no, explanation whatsoever.

Couldn’t ask for a worse service."
"They ""delivered"" my new computer worth more than a thousand euros to a non-existent neighbour, I have spent several days trying to find it and have not found it yet."
"My order was originally meant to take 1-5 working days, but when I got the confirmation email it was due in 10 days. The delivery date has been pushed back by a day and my package isn't even out for delivery yet (and it has been over a week) so I'm expecting further delays as it is a weekend and is due in 2 days. Considering delivery cost me £18 I'm quite upset and angry. How can you be one of the biggest couriers on the planet and still mess up this much. The 1 star average review says it all. Never using UPS again absolutely terrible."
"Terrible phone customer service! They lie to you and they don’t care about you! Lost $9,000 because of them!"
"If I could give zero stars I would!!!
I sent a package with 2 day air..expecting it to get there in 2 days. I sent on a Weds morning, expecting it to be delivered on Friday…. Now, they tell me it won’t get there till Monday…5 DAYS LATER!!!
UPS shouldn’t advertise 2 day delivery if they can’t follow through.
Will never ship with them again!!!"
"Well, here we are again; I never learned my lesson. My company has an account with UPS which bills me at the end of the month, so I often take advantage of it that's why I keep making these same mistakes over and over. Anyway, I overnighted a Mother's Day card for Saturday delivery on Friday. It cost me $64.00 for a simple envelope. Lo and behold, I was just notified that my mother, who by the way is very sick, will receive the card Monday, not Saturday. So here I am paying top dollar to make sure that my mother gets her Mother's Day card by Mother's Day and once again I get screwed. UPS is turning into the USPS in terms of reliability, so I guess either I start using USPS or another service like FedEx."
"2020 - UPS used to be my go to. I would pay extra to have them do my deliveries.

Now 2022- I will pay extra to have anyone but UPS. I get a lot of deliveries. I can not remember the last time I got a package on time from UPS. Late every single time. This is to a business address."
It took UPS more than 10 days to get a shipment from China to Belgium. Lousy service.
"Worst experience ever customer rep keeps telling me the same bs as well as the supervisor,there is no peace of mind I’ve been waiting on a package that they said was ready for pick up I paid the fee for them to say the shipment hasn’t even made it yet and there’s a delay"
UPS stated they left my package at an unknown post office so is not there responsibility. Verified with store I ordered it from and it was to arrive UPS. So oveuslly they lost my package. That's right UPS stated there is no way to know what post office they left it at!
"Useless, better throw a package in the air and there will be more chance to get it"
"The worst service
Unreliable and irresponsible no one one takes responsibility for the mistake
They let someone change the address of the delivery and another time they forgot to add the sticker on the pre paid envelope
Awful!!!"
"I paid for home delivery using UPS, and there were no notifications whatsoever telling when the package would arrive. Luckily I checked the delivery date with the tracking number and stayed at home all day to receive the package. However, tracking said delivery was unsuccessful because I wasn't at home. Clearly they didn't even try to deliver the package because they didn't even leave the delivery note in my mailbox and I would have either seen or heard the delivery car. So they didn't even bother coming close and just took the package to a ""nearby"" access point. The access point was so far away I had to take a bus (and pay for a bus ticket) to get to the access point. There was no way to request a new delivery because I didn't have the code required to do so since they didn't even deliver the note to my mailbox (or anywhere else near my house). So, I paid for home delivery and what I actually got was a delivery so far away that I had to even pay extra to get it."
"Beware, when shipping with UPS, if they lose your package you’ll be responsible to replace it yourself. I shipped a package with contents valued at $683.00. I did not purchase insurance and didn’t see there was a tiny box where you write in the declared value of the package. Regardless of all of this, UPS is still fully responsible for losing my package. They scanned it when they picked it up and it hasn’t been seen since. They did an investigation and could not locate the package. I received notification to my email address, in my name, to file a claim. I completed all the paperwork in my name, including a PayPal receipt from the company I purchased from, also in my name! Rather than fly home with this package I chose to ship it to my home address using my approved employer’s shipping account. The shipping label had me listed as the sender and the receiver. Why is all of this important? After filing the claim I was notified it was settled, I received a claim number directly to my email address in my name. After not receiving a check for over a week, I inquired, I was told they sent the check to my employers address in the amount of $100.00 made out to my employer! My employer has 50 locations throughout the US and over 10,000 employees. Imagine a company that only deals with shipping, loses your package and then doesn’t want to make good on it? I should not have to purchase insurance to ensure that they do their job, it’s what they do, they ship packages! I supplied photos of the product I shipped along with dated, itemized receipt and they decided they would reimburse me $100.00 and then didn’t even send the check to the person they have had all correspondence with! Does your dealership ask you if you want to purchase insurance or what you value your vehicle at in case our technician doesn’t know how to do his job? Of course not! Why? Because it’s what they do, it is their business! They agreed they lost the package, I provided the proof of the contents and the cost of the contents, and they still don’t want to pay! I’m absolutely outraged that a company such as this can get away with this! Absolute theft!"
"I live in Raleigh NC and would like to give a huge shout out to the UPS driver that dropped off my medication yesterday, super happy friendly guy, so fun connecting with you !! I also want to thank Steve at the 9660 store for his patience with me, my concerns and also checking to make sure my package was delivered!! You guys are Fantastic 😉😊
Marian Gourlay🌺"
If i was able to leave a zero i would..text said package was at front door same time that i was.out there they called driver who swore package was at front door..two hours later package was thrown at back door broken with items missing..UPS sweats package was delivered...really!!!!!
"Utterly useless and incompetent! One star, only because, as usual, it's not possible to give none or minus stars.

UPS app is not fit for purpose. Notification received that a parcel was to be delivered two days later, however, they attempted delivery the next day without advising me. However it gets worse as I was told a sub-contractor had tried to deliver it at 14.11 and had pushed the buzzer to my flat. I was at home from 13.45 and the buzzer did not sound. Notification received that parcel was redirected to an ""access point"" but not before receiving two identical emails in quick succession which were composed of blank database fields communicating absolutely nothing whatsoever. Every time I am informed that a supplier uses UPS I know I'm in for trouble. Avoid!!!!!!"
The worst courier company. For a week i can not pick up my parcel because in the point there is person who dont know how to speak English and dont know what to do. Customer service dont answer. So i have to cancell my order
"Incompetent scammers, their web site is usually broken (but will charge you anyway without providing the promised service)."
"My package never arrived to my home as instructed. Instead I received a message 30 minutes after the delivery time stating a delivery was unsuccessful and I would have to travel to a nearby pickup point to retrieve it. I was sat at home throughout the delivery period, within earshot of the door, with devices sounds all turned down. There was no knock or ring of the doorbell, so clearly the delivery driver didn't even bother to try to deliver the package."
When they deliver your package the throw it on the porch. Wish I could attach the video.
"I am an online seller of musical gear, guitars, amps, etc. I try to be fair, and objective in these reviews, and anyone who searches my review history can see that I am not a vindictive person at all.

However, in this same spirit of objectivity, and 'calling a spade a spade,' I have to strongly advise anyone who is starting an ecommerce business where shipping is imperative, against using UPS as your carrier.

I have had UPS delivery drivers repeatedly damage items that I have had shipped to customers, and I have lost money on my sales more than once.

What makes matters worse is that in my experience, they take no responsibility whatsoever for the damage that they cause. I recently tried to file a claim for damage to an item that they had caused, and because I had less than 7 photos of this damage, they refuse to allow this claim to be submitted. Are you kidding me? 7 photos? As if three clear photos of egregious damage aren't enough.

I am currently in the process of expanding my business, and let me tell you, I am not going with UPS as my carrier of choice, that's for sure.
Just thought that you should know."
"We received a parcel from UPS via their courier, which worked fine (so maybe 2 stars should be given for getting it to us).

The parcel, however, includes baby equipment that once used, needs to be returned to a UPS Access Point. We have tried multiple different Access Points in Tooting (SW London) on different days and have been fed exactly the same line that their ""UPS Machine isn't working"". Google reviews indicate that I'm not the first to experience this. As a result of the rejection of our parcel, we've been fined £50 by the supplier in overdue fees. We still haven't managed to drop it off and don't know how to return it!"
This company is beyond a credible company they are the lowest form of customer service rejects I have ever seen. We ordered 2 electric bikes 4000$ and they first say there was a issue with a battery and days later now they state that they lost it/ stole it !!! And when we call to get answers They state they are tired of dealing with us. Don’t use UPS go with fedex !!!!
"I tried to send a parcel from UK to Spain, first of all it wasn't picked up when it was supposed to (I paid extra to have it picked up) and I had to call about 5 times to reschedule. When I finally managed to get it to UPS it was sent back because it didn't have the commertial invoice nedded for exportation. It was a personal item and I wasn't informed at any point about it needing any documentation, nor was I notified about the problem, they just returned it without telling me!!!! Of course I had to pay for the service even though the package was returned and it wasn't my fault. Then I had to place a new shipment request and pay again full price, and when contacting them for help about how to fill the commertial invoice they just kept sending me links where I couldn't find the information I needed, they wouldn't read the problem I was explaining in my multiple emails. I had to call 4 times to costumer service in order to clarify this. On its way to spain I recieved another message about necessary documentation and had to call 3 times again, the first agent told me the package was already in Barcelona, the second told me it was in France, and the 3rd said it was still in London, that was all in the same day! How can they not know where the package is?? On top of that when the parcel finally reached Spain there were importation fees to be paid and instead of contacting me they called the person at the UPS access point shop for him to pay. Of course he refused and I got a message that my shipment had been refused and would go back to the UK. 3 calls later I could solve this and finally got my package.
This has been a horrible experience, the package has taken 2 full months to arrive when it should have taken maximum 7 days (according to what I paid for), and they have the worst costumer service ever."
"I recently ordered an item from Amazon that apparently required a signature but because I am a My Choice member any package that requires a signature can be delivered any way. That is nice until the item is broke or defective.I like not having to go somewhere and pick my packages up, who has time for that.I contacted the seller and they could not file an insurance claim because I am a My Choice member. I have never heard of this and neither had the seller. The seller stepped up and is sending me a new item through the post office this time. So beware of this, you cannot make an insurance claim if you are a member. I think this is stupid! Maybe it's their way of getting out of paying for something."
"Trying to rebook a delivery slot before the parcel was difficult and had to wait until the next day to do so- I was changing it from arriving on a Friday to the following Tuesday when I would be in. When I was finally able to do so it was easy enough. Confirmation email of the change was received. I went to work the Friday and was then sent a text from my husband that the parcel, a large rug, had been delivered when no one was there and had been left outside our door visible to all. Thankfully it had not disappeared but this is poor service from a usually good courier but shows they don’t listen to their customers and changing the delivery date was a waste of everyone’s time"
"Worst courier that ever existed. I paid online for expedited delivery. Had legal documents that had to be delivered the next day in another city. Pick up was 9am - 1pm. I called by 11:30am to reconfirm pick up and they informed me that the driver was on the way. No one came. I called back at 3pm and they informed me that the driver had too many pickups that's why he didn't come. No information, no notice nothing. Do not ever use UPS. They are highly incompetent. This may cost me my transaction. I am from a third world country and our courier service is way better than this. This is really poor and unprofessional."
"I ordered an item on Amazon, but was informed UPS delivered it. It's pouring rain today, I saw the package and was pleasantly surprised by a plastic bag with my box in it to protect it! I wish I knew who delivered it, they deserve a tip or something, that was such a nice thing to do. Thank you so much, I've never had anyone deliver an item with such care in 20yrs lol.
You guys set the bar high with customer service and it's appreciated!!!"
Delivered package to wrong address and on the west coast when I live on the East coast. Customer service sucked!!! Filed a claim never responded to it. Do better UPS do not be like the UPSP.
"If I could give negative stars I would. I’ve been chasing a package for ten days: call the number, get their the automated to finally talk to a person, get told the package is on the way, no show, call again, “sorry, it was mistakenly puton wrong truck”, call again, “here’s a case number, I’ve escalated this”, call again, “it’s at the customer care center” drive 45 minutes to care center and it’s closed for lunch … you get the idea. It’s the absolute worst company for customer care and service. They don’t seem to know where packages are. I am so eager to avoid them in the future they may have cured my Amazon habit."
"Import fees and no method to pay. Another terrible experience. UPS won't deliver my package until the import fees are payed, but none of the payment methods on their website are working. Customer services is a long-distance phone call to the US who passed me off to a hold queue with no answer after half an hour. Still not sure how I can collect my package. Based in the UK, package is coming from Germany."
"Worst service on the planet - UPS driver delivered my parcel to the wrong address & I have been on the phone with them non-stop and they still can't tell me where it is. I have been advised that the a driver is retrieving it...and that is all. No idea when I will see it or if I will see it. The 2 people I have spoken to that have identified themselves as supervisors where actually the nastiest people I have spoken to at their ""service center"" so far - one of them being a UPS hub supervisor whose employee dropped the ball. She was so rude and I was made to feel like this issue was completely my fault.
The entire process has been a cluster....
@UPS
#worstserviceever"
It should have really been a ZERO ! I called 3 different times for someone to pick up a package that was not mine. I was honest by calling and felt bad for the person who was waiting for the package that I had ! Someone really dropped the ball on this one.
A bunch of worthless people. I now know why their uniforms are brown and that's because the are so full of shi#.
"How are these clowns still in business. Impossible to get in touch with them and the ""delivery date"" keeps slipping back. Pathetic!"
Horrible delivery service! We have called numerous times telling them to quit putting our packages in the ditch on the road and they have yet to stop!
"I live in a condo in Florissant. Was waiting for my package and the UPS never rang my doorbell, they just left a note. I am very unhappy now with UPS. They are getting bad at leaving packages and Fed Ex is getting better now. I am so upset with UPS right now."
very fast delivery good pricenice product
"They lost my package— my $200 package that required signage to drop off. It has a traceable scanning record showing where it is in their system, yet the “cannot find it”. “We will launch an investigation for the lost package”, they said. I asked them what they would do if they could not find the package and the lady told me they would pay for it.
I called back a week later to check on the status and the investigation was closed on day 3. Why, You ask? Was it found??! No, it was not. They closed it and never contacted me to tell me.

I opened a new investigation and a month later they are still “looking” for the package. They said they will call the seller to look for it. Why? It’s been documented that it shipped and it’s at a UPS facility. Why are you contacting the seller?
Well, the seller felt so bad for me that they sent me a replacement but I did ask them if UPS was reimbursing them for the lost item. They told me UPS refuses to pay for it."
After months of the same delivery from the same company UPS was unable to deliver today due to an incorrect address. The package is fresh meat and will probably sit in a warehouse over the weekend. If I am not reimbursed by UPS I will seek legal counsel for recovery procedures.
"If I could give zero stars, I would. Had a package shipped to my daughter. Tracking showed it had arrived at the UPS Hub in Tualatin on Wednesday, which is only about 5 miles from her home and that it was out for delivery. It didn't arrive. On Thursday, tracking showed it had arrived at the Hub in Tualatin (again) and was out for delivery (again). It didn't arrive. Today, on Friday, tracking once again showed it arriving at the Hub in Tualatin, and that it was out for delivery. I phoned UPS and when I finally got a human on the line (it took an hour), the UPS Rep looked at tracking, said it did look ""weird"", and promised me that she would contact the delivery driver to make them aware of the situation. She also promised a call-back to me within one hour. Plus, she guaranteed that the package would be delivered TODAY. Fast forward 8 hours and NO call-back, and still NO delivery. I wish Amazon would allow us to choose the carrier we would like to use because UPS sux."
"The most unprofessional and hopeless company I've ever experienced. Received a bill on 24th of March 2022, for something that was invoiced 3rd of May 2021! Yes, 11 months difference. So, naturally I had no idea what this was for and very skeptical to pay the bill. UPS, as I've experienced before, had dated the bill as 3rd of March 2022, but also managed to send me a reminder SMS to pay on the same day I received the bill.

The SMS said ""If we haven't received payment or heard from you in 7 days, we will send the bill for collection by a debt collecting company"". I send them an email straight away asking what the bill was - received no reply.

I did however, receive a bill from the debt collecting company this week (last week of April)! They also had the same approach as UPS - dated the bill 7th of April and the 14 days you have to pay the demand have already expired once you receive the bill.

Complained again to UPS and got a reply from someone called Konstantin Mparakos at UPS Sverige AB.

The reply did only explain what the bill was for, nothing else and nothing more. No ""we're sorry"", no ""we apologies for the inconvenience"" and certainly ""we are so sorry that this was incorrectly sent to the debt collecting company - we will pay the extra fee that has been added!""

So for UPS - you guys really need to understand what good customer service is. From my experience, you have no idea what that entitles. The number of 1 star reviews here says it all as well."
"This is the worse delivery company ever. They lost my parcel that I'm been waiting for more then 3 months, really bad customer service, no information whatsoever. Do not send anything with them."
Worst ever business I would never ship there these people and there customer service reps are just as bad with the worst attitudes in the world like if you don’t like your job quit. And if they don’t deliver to your location they will still charge you for shipping and have you pick up the package and not tell the business… I HOPE AMAZON AND FEDEX PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS!!!
"They didn't follow any of the deadlines or days the supposed our packet come. The packet arrives a day I was out of home and so, they inform me (When I was trying to track it) that my driver goes to a different country. So many bad reviews and you still haven’t change anything….."
Made our fifth call to UPS customer service today to let them know that drivers are still leaving boxes at our mailbox even though I signed up thru the UPS site to ask drivers to leave packages at our door since we live down a 1/3 mile gravel driveway. We know that drivers have productivity requirements and that this is probably why they don't take the time to drop off properly. Neighbors have the same problem..driver told him that supervisor told him not to drive to houses in this area--takes too long. We never have this problem with FedEx or USPS.
"Stop messing up my Packages!! I tried to send you guys the correct address multiple times on your shi**y website/app, because I can’t seem to be able to get a real person on the phone and I just keep getting my packages not dropped off. Actually the worst delivery service around"
This is the worst and third class service of Canada never ever send any thing even you don’t have any other option don’t go with this third class courier service.
"I had a VPN enabled & it gave this message AFTER I did all the work of filling out the forms: ""UPS internal security measures prevent the processing of this shipment.""

Firstly companies shouldn't be blocking VPN's as they are essential privacy tools in todays day & age, also if they aren't going to block VPN's, why do they wait until the very end. Screw UPS, use Fedex, as least they aren't engaging in IP censorship.

Blocking access on the basis of IP address should be illegal, & there should be strict net-neutrality laws in place to protect privacy preserving solutions."
"1 star is too good for this company. The pickup truck is so lazy and never pick up any orders. I live in Lawrenceville, GA and my home camera show the pick truck driver came and didn’t ring the bell. Both times all they did was left the return labels and walked away. The return label show local phone number but it not working number. If they thinks the job is hard, they should looking for other job. Don’t be so lazy😡"
TERRIBLE SERVICE. NOT HELPFUL. DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT DELIVERY BUT SAID THEY DID. OACKAGE STILL SAYS OUT FOR DELIVERY HOURS LATER. WILL FOREVER BE USING FED EX.
"This is not the first time, But when sending a package the chances are that it won't get scanned into the system for 24 hrs. You can call and push buttons for 20 minutes or repeat the tracking number 3 or 4 times with no result OR talk to a non English speaking rep. UPS is by far the worst carrier out there.
STAY AWAY use FedEx or the Post Office"
"These people don't deserve a one star.
Horrible they give no effort what so ever.
Simple fix when they don't feel like delivering is to write can not find adress will try again..

Horse !!!!!+!++"
"Ordered from the same company in the last 2 months 3 times for next day deliver, Once your package gets to Louisville..Its lost in all that mess, Never get updates and when you do it always says ""Flight Delay"" That is a bunch of BS. My current package was suppose to be delivered Yesterday last up date was yesterday morning 730am said it departed from DFW I live 2 hours from DFW No update till this morning at 630am saying it processed through my local office..Tell me where my package was for 11 hours? You call Customer Service and you speak with someone in India that have no clue on what they are doing if you can get someone that speaks English, they are just reading the same thing I'm reading via the website. I've asked them to tell me where my package is for 11 hours..They never give you a Answer..UPS is the WORSE for Overnight deliver, I'm never had any problems with FEDEX Overnight."
"I don't think they could be worse if they tried. Three packages sent with UPS, and all mismanaged, delivered late, and requiring numerous calls to try to get them moving. Excuses ranged from vehicle problem, attempted delivery - a blatant lie, to recipient name being wrong, even when it was an established account, visible on the paperwork and online.

Customer Service support is of little use, and in many European countries there is no option to speak to someone in English, which given UPS operates globally and multinationals are located there, is crazy.

There is nothing to recommend UPS. They are, pure and simply, a delivery company, and they can't even get that right. And they couldn't care less. A message in a bottle would do better."
The absolute worst shipping company there is. Impossible to be any worse.
"Every time they delivered my package, they sat it on the porch and drive off than changed status to delivered. No knock, No signature basically leave my stuff out there for the world to pick up. At least knock on the door loud enough than walk off. most of the time my door be open if im expecting a package that day. Right now I can’t find a package because they left it “at the door” and it’s a waste of time filing a claim. Just horrible. TRAIN these drivers to KNOCK.. leave notes.. or something!"
"The company clearly ignored mi complaints about a parcel was delivered damaged and items lost. I filled the form and uploaded the photo like a proof of my complaint like they asked.
At the no any sign of care . I need it to chased myself instead of they show a bit of care to the customer."
"First I got an email, saying that I can manage my shipping details on the UPS platform. I tried to register, but when I received an email to verify my email, I could no longer log in, because it said that no account exists with such an email. I tried registering again, with the same email, and then it said that it is not possible to register, since an account for that email already exists.

So I had to call customer service and arrange for a delivery time. At the agreed time, no one came and I later got an automated email saying that the delivery could not be made and that it will be redirected to a pick up spot nearby. The driver had been by my building while I was at home, but could not call to say that they were here or ask for the doorcode. Ridiculous! I called customer service again, and they said that drivers are not provided with phones from UPS and that's why they don't have the obligation to call. Not very sustainable, driving back and forth with packages, just because they can't make a simple phone call! How much money does not providing the drivers with phones actually save for UPS?? I'm guessing they could cut down customer service staff by 80% too, if they just gave the drivers phones...

A few days later I received an email saying that my parcel was in a store nearby, so I went to pick it up. They could not find it and asked me to come back the next day. When I came back, it was nowhere to be found and apprently it had never been entered into the store's systems, i.e., it had been delivered somewhere else. According to the online tracking of UPS it should have been at that store.

So, I called customer service again, furious. They said that they have to open an investigation in order to find out where the package could be. Very well, some more waiting...

A few weeks later, after having heard nothing from UPS or the whereabouts of my package I called them up to see what's going on. They informed me that the package had been returned to the sender. What??! So the package had been returned to the sender without ever informing me of where it was or even giving me a chance to receive it. Not quite the service you expect from a company main business is delivering packages...

This was the second time within a short period of time that I've had to do battle with UPS customer service. I honestly think that it is the worst delivery service on the market."
"Had a delivery of tiki torches, less than a hundred bucks, first delivery left a note needs a signature. Put a note on my door, just put them in the car, hit the lick button, next day, another note needs to be signed for. I work for a living, not around m-f. Had to pay 5.99 to have it left at the local facility the trucks operate out of, paid it. Went there, the lady behind the counter was not personable, waited ten minutes for her to come out from where she was, the ironic part about it was, I didn't have to sign to get my package. Signed nothing! Business need to accommodate for working people."
Had a delivery today from Amazon the driver pulled up sat the package on my front porch and left didn't even knock on the door and then updated the delivered status and said left by side door thats a lie it was in my front porch 😀
I honestly can't imagine how their service could get any worst.
I shouldn’t give them no star is going to give them one I was supposed to have a package delivered today But there was nothing delivered at my front door at all this is the worst delivery service ever I would never have UPS live in my packages anymore I’m done with UPS. So I’ll put in a claim so I’m gonna wait and see this is the second time they said something was delivered at my door and it was never delivered at all the employees don’t care about the packages they just delivered anyway wanna say they delivered it.
"Every package I’ve ordered this year has been at least three days late. Currently waiting on a package that was supposed to be here over 8 days ago and it didn’t move for four or five DAYS. Their customer service is a joke, I call constantly to try to see where my packages are and if I could just pick them up from my local post office instead of waiting a full business day for them to get delivered after they’re already late. There’s barely any opportunity to speak to a real human being, it’s always just the dumb robot who doesn’t understand anything. I hate ups with a fiery passion."
"Well, prior to my last recent review, I ordered an item from Coach only to get a text stating again stating it was delivered...NOT..after contacting Coach an email was received stating a new delivery date and that a signature would be required due to my prior GIVEAWAY, well, once delivered on yesterday, the UPS guy DID NOT ask for my husbands' signature but thank God it was delivered to correct address this time because once again my package would have been given away. So now I have two bad situations one day apart, never received my patio set and my original Coach item was given away so HAPPY MOTHERS DAY to someone!"
Worst courier company. I wasn’t given a time window when my package would be delivered only by end of day. At the end of the day the package was not delivered and I didn’t received any updates. I emailed UPS and didn’t get a response. It is difficult to contact UPS. Don’t use this company if you have other options.
"They lose packages and can never seem to give an honest answer why. I can only assume they are stealing stuff and getting away with it ? I have had 1000's of dollars of stuff just ""missing"" and when I call, they could care less. CAN WE PLEASE GET A DECENT SHIPPING COMPANY?! Thin one SUCKS!"
"Let me start by saying I HATE UPS..
Not once have they delivered a package to my apartment. Its ALWAYS been ohh we missed you. How can they miss me When I'm at home waiting.. aslo the front doorbell is connected to my cell phone.. NO CALL.....absolutely the worst Company to deal with.. I will never send or have anything I buy come through UPS.. In fact Im going to Blog on ALL MY CHANNELS on line that what a garbage company UPS is.. If I could give a negative 100 Stars I would.."
UPS is by far the worse delivery service around. I get an email stating my package has been delivered to my MAILBOX...WELL NOT MY MAILBOX! Not once have I received a package but the neighbor has! I always have to wait for my neighbors to bring it to me when they get home from work which is late in the evening. As of today I will know longer buy from companies that use UPS. Disgusted!
Talked to 4 rep. of UPS to get my package delivered each one said we will send a communication to our centre to make they deliver your package. Still have not received but get daily updates that it will be delivered that date. Bunch of incompetent.
"So, I ordered a parcel. Easy enough. Was told it was on its way and would be delivered between 10:45 and 2:45. No big deal as my wife and I were both home during those hours. We're sitting enjoy our lunch, looking out at the front yard where the birds flit about as they eat the seed we leave for them, and where we have a perfect view of our driveway. Suddenly, my phones chimes. It's UPS. They've delivered my package. That seemed odd as we did not see the driver come on our property. Maybe they're using drones now. But then it says, ""Package was left at side door."" We don't have a side door. Weird. Maybe it's at the neighbours. Nope. And then the biggest mistake of all was made, I called UPS for clarification. My favourite comment so far, ""You can't leave a message with the person in charge of this investigation because they don't have voice mail.""

I used to love UPS. Loved our driver and his shorts in all weather. Loved his care for our stuff. I hate UPS now. What a sham."
"Shipped a package from my home town, to wasilla Anchorage, package was returned to my home address, the package was ammo, so ups does not ship ground to Alaska it has to be in a plane, charged me for ground shipping, package never got shipped, and been trying g to get someone at customer service to resolve the issue, impossible, now it's been 1 year, finally got through to representive and said it's been to long for reimbursement, pretty crappy service, disappointing, and out my money."
"Sent return label to UPS to print. Clerk printed wrong return label. Am still trying to get a person to explain what happened. Label I sent to them in their file as not yet printed. Don’t understand how a label can be printed twice, but it certainly happened. And the tracking shows package was delivered. Yes, two packages were!"
My package was shipped from California to Tennessee. The package was lost in Ontario Canada. An investigation was opened with no results. A claim has been opened. Why was my package sent to Canada?
Let me just say this is an ongoing issue with UPS delivering to my house. They send my packages to wrong post office. When I have a delivery they can stop at my house deliver packages across the street but posts that they could not find my house and I even put house on back of property on my packages and have it as a preference on my ups app. I am not sure why they have such an issue with getting my packages to my house but let me just say they don’t seem to care about making sure they take the time to get my packages to me. I have called and complained numerous times to let them know there is a major issue. This has been going on since the middle of last year and continues to this year 2022. I am not fond of when I see UPS is delivering my package because 9 chances out of 10 I may be waiting a few extra days to get my packages.
"I spent $11 to send just a letter 2 hours away from my home and it has been over a week and the important documents in this letter has not been delivered. I will stop using UPS services because it is too slow and to expensive for the service you receive. As of today, my letter states on their tracking system ""DELAY"". Terrible service."
"If I could this company a zero I would, I’ve had an awful experience with this company. I was shipping some boxes over to America from the uk they never got delivered and they lost 2 of my boxes"
"This delivery service is a non-delivery service. Don't buy anything from any company that uses them. They promise delivery on one day, randomly change to three days later with no explanation. I wait in all day, then they slip a paper note under the door without ringing saying I have to pick the package up from some random wine shop 1 km away. I ring to rearrange delivery and get an automated service that apparently acknowledges this. Since then I have heard nothing. Meanwhile, the suppliers and their tracking system say the parcel has been delivered. So i have no delivery and I will have to fight to get a refund. How are UPS in business and why do suppliers use them when I can see from this thread that they are a disaster?"
"Driver refuses to follow directions on UPS my choice and put packages at my front door, instead he drives past my home and places packages at the luxer one lockers, creating a hardship for me to go over to the luxer lockers and walk home carrying packages while taking care of my disabled child. Last week I watched the driver go upstairs, deliver packages to the neighbor and right afterwards went and placed my packages in the luxer locker."
Delivered package to wrong address I am assuming. Literally $300 package. Can't seem to get anybody on the phone. Only virtual assistance that leads you to claims and then around in circles. Most carriers (even USPS these days) take photos of where they left your package. Imbeciles don't even do that. Utter incompetence at the highest level. I hope they get hemorrhoids.
I have had several problems with UPS delivering my packages. I either don't receive my packages or they are open and the merchandise is missing out of them. I rather pay FEDEX the money to get a safe deliver then to not get my package. VERY POOR SERVICE.
"There is nothing worse, than UPS delivery service in Finland.
Paying extra to get order faster, and what you get? Nothing. Especially you get bad feeling, when you see UPS car moving in front of you, turning to Rekola (while you are waiting it in Havukoski). And no show. Delivery next day. And again, my parcel was just travelling with courier all day to get back to depot in the evening.

5 calls to customer service (only one was connected to Finnish worker, 4 others, somehow, to international service). And the result - nothing
My parcel with work things for weekend markets is in depot until Monday. Oh God, I would recommend this service only to my enemies. To see them suffering while trying to get something via UPS.

WORST DELIVERY SERVICE EVER!"
UPS is literally the WORSE shipping company! I’ve had multiple packages never get delivered because they have my address under as a commercial address when it’s simply an apartment. I’ve jumbled through hoops trying to get it fixed and every time they say it will be done it never does!! I get BS attempt notifications made when NO ONE ACTUALLY COME TO MY DOOR NOR TRYS TO LEAVE IT WITH THE FRONT OFFICE OR PARCEL LOCKERS! UPS needs to get their system update and get better functions for issues like this! If F****** ridiculous!!!
"According to their tracking number my package of dog food had arrived at their nearby shipping facility today. I simply wanted to go pick it up, but they would not allow it. Instead, it will be delivered to the post office and they will deliver it tomorrow - maybe."
"Very bad customer support. I have sent a package that was even smaller in dimensions than stated but still was charged later on more for a bigger package. No info about why they did it, nor why they did it. Contacted customer care to ask why, what happened so that I can pay attention the next time, but the only answer ""we will check and get back to you"". They of course never came back and after me writing several times (couple of months waisted) I just got an answer ""Rejected by our center"". Great answer, thanks for letting me know why you increased the price (different package size) :)"
"I paid for Express Delivery which should have been next day.
2 days later still no parcel

NEVER AGAIN will I use UPS."
I advise anyone sending package with UPS ( United Parcel Service) to Finland to think 100 times before he do so. It is the worst service you ever could see. You will not be giving information you will not be told when the item going to be delivered. My delivery supposed to arrive in the 4th and today is 21st I called hundreds of times I got nowhere. They don't provide you with tracking information or delivery information and if you call and ask for the manager he's not willing to come to the phone because he's paid to sit behind the desk to look pretty only not to solve issue or help customer. After long search I discovered someone attend to deliver parcel three time without being sent message about delivery time. When I called and asked why I wasn't informed about the delivery. Answer somebody attempt to deliver can't get access . Even I was home all that week. I said I have been waiting 25 days and I'm leaving on Sunday back to UK and I have not received the package. She answer yes yes I know I can't help you we try next Monday to deliver. I said I'm leaving on Sunday and today Friday 10 am morning couldn't you do it today I'm leaving on Sunday . If I'm leaving in Sunday how I am going to pick up the package on Monday. Answer we can't help you. you could pick it up next time when you come to Finland only way I could help you. I asked for the manager she said we don't have a manager here. Now I have two packages under the sympathy if UPS. I advise any person who doesn't want to be stressed for weeks not to send percale to Finland with UPS. You don't have delivery time or delivery info or info about customer clearness. It's not the first time happened to me with UPS is the third time.
"Bad customer service. Bad system. A big liar!
They said to deliver my package 10 days ago and until now, I haven't recieved anything. I called customer service and got answer a very bad attitude agent."
"UPS Effing sucks! My package for school supposed to come yesterday 4/21 but it never came, I called the customer service and asked what’s the status of my package the person said my package never got loaded in the truck but the website says it’ll be deliver by 19:00 4/21

UPS providing false information as always, also I tried to change the delivery date and they want to charge me $$$ I won’t even pay a dime for your sucks service!! please whoever reading this avoid this company at all cost!!"
Very unhappy with this service. Makes me want to not ever order anything anymore. They say attempt delivery. And been waiting all day and they never even showed up. Customer service very rude. When I call them about it. This has happened more than once.
Didn't even want to give one star there website is not used friendly and when you call customer service they tell you one thing and it is wrong or they hung up on you. I had someone here to get package and was told they would be here at one time and they didn't show up also tried again and still come before they said they would be here. Will never use them again
"I am very pleasantly surprised at UPS's service today. A very important package as to be delivered to my mothers home. The sender had the city and zip code incorrect. I called the sender and they really didn't know how to fix it. I used the UPS website and a live chat with a UPS representative. She was able to correct the mistake on her end! My mothers package is now in touted to the correct place.
Thank you UPS!!"
Paid extra money for overnight shipping. Item was out for delivery 2 days later and the UPS truck was on my street and left without delivering my package. It needed to be signed for and I was waiting to receive the package so I could go on my business trip. Now I’m waiting around all day for something that should’ve been delivered days ago. Worst service I’ve ever had. Go with any other carrier
Unacceptable customer service. UPS lost my package and here I am 4 months later with no solution. Nearly impossible to speak with anyone. This was a Christmas present and you cannot get the item any longer. I will think twice before I ever use ups again.
Mailed package at Pittsburgh Beaver Avenue office. Package was never scanned or delivered. Someone must be stealing packages. We don’t know what happened is NOT a good enough answer. Never again using this company and will definitely spread the word! My daughter moved to Nashville for work and I was sending her a package filled with stuff for Easter along with a personalized jacket so she didn’t feel homesick. I hope whoever stole it has the same name! Very angry!!
Very fast delivery and goods arrived in excellent condition.
"SYDNEY OFFICE DAY&ROSS/UPS ARE INCOMPETENT UNRELIABLE, THEY DON'T CARE! THEY TOLD ME THAT!! THEY SAID I DON'T CARE! HOW CAN A COMPANY (UPS) STAY IN BUSINESS WITH A CONTRACTOR LIKE (DAY&ROSS SYDNEY ) !!!"
This is the worst experience I ever had with a delivery company! I was moving from England to spain so I sent 3 boxes and 2 big suitcases. They sent back 2 boxes for no reason. I had to send them again and they took back to london another one! Then I was Fighting for my boxes for over 5 months when finally the boxes came to spain I had to go and pick them up! Then they extra charge me over 70 euros for no reason so I have to pay it or they wouldn’t give my stuff that I already paid for. Then everything was broken and in bad conditions. They lost a lot of stuff. And over q year later they sent me a letter telling me that I have to pay another 45 e for some other bull S*** they invented that obviously I am not going to pay! I am going to demand them! I had enough!! Don’t trust this company is a total scam! And the people working there won’t help u at all! I been sending stuff for years never had this experience with any other company! WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!
"they just delivered half of delivery, after many weeks got this :
Parcels are in access point.

Both are in UAP, they’ve just scanned the wrong barcode over there.

They didnt even write an adress and a ask for picking it up (even thats not my job, i ordered to home) now they sent it back , its a joke!
no apologize whatsoever... but hey they just scanned the barcode wrong right.

thanks UPS for all the troubles."
UPS is devious. They Lie! They say no one is available to accept package. Out an out LIE! I worked from home since I track my package on there website and it states what specific date my package is to be delivered. So I am home waiting for a package but instead get a door tag stating no one was available to accept package! That is so devious and just plain not true! Call customer service...they only can do so much. Request to speak to a supervisor....go figure... no one is available....will return call in one hour.....ahhh still no callback. I know I am only one person...but going forward when I place an order and if they use UPS...I will not place an order.
The employees are rude and think they know it all as 20 year olds. Was charged a “pick up fee” for a package that was routed to them by UPS which I paid $13 for already to UPS. Nowhere on the terms or through the check out process of routing the package do you get informed of this additional ransom charge to get your package. This a lawsuit waiting to happen…and I will be glad when they go after all of the stores that are taking advantage of their corporate customers. Keep in mind that these are rules made up by individual store owners that corporate is not aware of
worst company i’ve ever dealt with. told me i have to pick up my package from a location over thirty minutes away because they “can’t deliver to a p.o. box” yet my friend ordered the exact same thing and they delivered it to their p.o. box. overall terrible experience and horrible staff at local stores.
Garbage company garbage delivery garbage drivers garbage service hope it goes under never even knocked or run just leaves sticker and goes careless people do not use this service
"Just absolutely terrible. Never tried to deliver my package. Dropped it at some pick up point and just told me to pick it up myself.
Worst service ever. Despite multiple please to deliver it no one seems to be responding and just sending me round in circles."
"Delivery driver doesn't call me via intercom or my cell. Every redelivery attempt has thus failed. Website doesn't update so I don't know if they're redelivering or not, even though customer support said they would redeliver. It's now reaching max day held on the postal office. It's heavy. I need them to redeliver. I wasted hours of my life. I'm very upset. Still haven't gotten my packages."
"Soo freakin bad, dealyed with 3 days and no expected delivery date. Do not even deserve a 1 star. Never use ups ever agian its a big joke"
"One star is too much for a company that doesn't deliver!!

What happened to UPS? This company used to have a promise for the 'Express' one-day delivery time or the 'Standard' 3 to 5 days delivery time which now no longer exists!

Parcels sent from the UK to the EU must NOT show 'Express' or 'Standard' delivery times attributed to the services offered as those times NEVER happen!

The 'days' become weeks and how is that possible when parcels sent to the UK from the EU do not experience any of the delays that the EU imposes on British parcels?

The 'English' customer support for UPS is based in India and all they do is apologise for the ABSOLUTELY RUBBISH service that UPS offers!

UPS isn't cheap it's overpriced and for that exorbitant charge it doesn't deliver! The staff that handle the packages and deliver them are kind and helpful but the management are AWFUL!

Sack the management, particularly the board of directors, and revive a company that used to deliver parcels 'on time'!

Do you remember those days UPS, when parcels were delivered on time?

UPS stands for the Useless Parcel Service and it is now amongst the WORST delivery companies in the world!!

AVOID!!"
"Horrible experience ! Do not deserve any star at all !!
Every updare on the tracking, is only delayed.
First delayed because of scanning, 2nd delayed because of mechanical error, and now delayed for no reasons and worst no expected delivery dates.
If you know your goods will stuck in China because of the pandemic, why do you accept the delivery in the first place. you should close down the operation and tell customers you cannot fullfill this shipment!! It is so funny that when we call, you said this is beyond your control! This is definitely in your control because you can definitely reject shipments !!!! but you are just a greedy company who wants to take our money and not be resposible of the delayed shipment."
I purchased a children's place order on 4/5/22 and the delivery was for 4/9/22 but the thing was they said it was delivered but in reality the package never made it to my address so I make a complaint and the phone run around and was told by the shipper I couldn't get a refund because it was marked as delivered and UPS couldn't find the package or the driver REALLY so my granddaughter clothes just disappeared people be careful with ups they are not as reputable as they want people to think ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
AWFUL Company! I sent a package from the NL to IT following the instructions on their official site; I have prepaid the order strictly following their instructions and the package was correct in dimensions and weight. After the package has been shipped I have been charged extra 5.82 EUR on my credit card without any valid reason. After one month of calling and asking for an explanation they simply said the UPS control decided to charge this amount based on UPS control and this is a complete fraud since they advertise their prices slightly lower than other companies and then add an extra fee. Luckily there are many more professional shipping companies I will use in the future.
UPS very bad experience service our first experience its to bad kindly don't use this service otherwise you will cry
"No notification from UPS, left wondering where my parcel was. Only found out when I was sent an email to review the product! Had to phone Wetsuit outlet to be told it had been delivered to a UPS drop off point a week ago – how are I supposed to know this?! Absolute incompetent, useless, lazy delivery company. Only one worse is Hermes."
"Terrible customer service and delivery. Package was supposed to be dropped off, but it wasn't. I tried to call the customer service line to find out how and when it would be delivered only to talk to a computer that couldn't help me."
"UPS= UPSET , always making excuses and sending emails ( we missed you ( lairs) ,your package is late ..etc , I am even surprised who you still in business"
Missold next day delivery. Tickets then redundant and couldn’t go to event over £200 down and no compensation or consequential loss. No refund even though they guaranteed it. Do not use. Took over six weeks to respond to my initial email.
Took my import fee payment and then refused to deliver saying I hadn't payed. Found the customer service number and they kept curting me off saying I'd phoned the wrong department. Didn't even bother trying a transfer.
Delivery issue due to missing apartment number. I changed it in the website. A service representative changed it and they still did not deliver it. They sent it back to sender. I made five phone calls. And the delivery person could have easily found my apartment number on the directory.
My delivery was supposed to arrive on 13/4 and didn’t come then said it was to arrive on 14/4 and didn’t arrive now it has no delivery date on it and it has still not arrived and have no idea when it will.
"Very unreliable and they charge very high. They don’t get to you address and lie, putting a note that you refused to receive the package and requested package be sent back. This is the 3rd time ups is messing up my business and causing me a great loss. I am tired of them. To think that they charge higher than other shipping. They refuse to follow simple and straight instructions then lie. My instruction was to drop my package at the complex drop box as every other shipping company does. This is the 3rd time ups is disregarding my instructions on a service I pay good money for. I am going all round social media and to share my ordeal about shipping through ups."
"Awesome product , fast delivery . very happy"
"My order was not delivered on the specified date and the process took too long. The delivery of my order was delayed even though I stated that my order was too late to leave the country on the specified date. and I had to leave the country. My order needs to be cancelled. Due to my country's exchange rate difference, when the refund is made, I have to pay my bank because of your mistake."
This is the worst delivery experience I had. Updated address 3 times and package still not delivered. They say they got the update but they driver left so why wouldn't they message the driver smh
Worst delivery experience ever. Unable to deliver since Thursday after I called 4 times to let them know they were missing my unit number even though I wrote it correctly. I then resorted to just get the package delivered to the closest UPS location after several days of them trying to deliver and having the same problem . I check this morning and they dropped it off over in another location over an hour away. I have no bed and now have to waste gas and on top of that I’ll get charge to pick up a package because of their incompetence. 0 stars. Worst customer service!!!!!!
"Ups still has a box in there truck thT was supposed to be delivered since Thursday. 4 days now and they are not capable of delivering this box to a place of business. From tracking to delivery, ups really has hit rock bottom."
"Overall great experience, just that initial ETA date had been pushed out 2 additional days"
"I would give you zero stars if possible. Thanks UPS for damaging a family heirloom picture on the process of delivery.

Thanks UPS for starting a claim on the picture YOU damaged then completely “ghosting” me. Of which I sent you documentation and over 1 dozen pictures you requested.

Not that this review will matter to you and your multi billion dollar a year business however just had to put it out there."
"Don't use them, they will charge you $8 plus to pick up packages at THEIR OWN DROP-OFF LOCATIONS, after failing to deliver on purpose."
I have never had a package delivered on time with this worthless company!!!
Lieing about over night I need my 15.00 dollars back I order a package April 14 and they say it be here April 18 im never coming here again keep happen to me every time so for now on im going with FedEx because they always on time no more ups fir me
"I call for a price on making a photo copy and they said $. 20 cents. No problem, had 2 copies made price $.54 cents. The charge me 5 cents more because lady help me.
So i get charge for Customer Service. It's just the point being charge and not told before helping me.
Shame on UPS, policy sucks"
"They are absolutely the worst.
The driver left my package “God knows where”, I opened a case it’s been 5 months and still waiting in the call back. I have called everyone gave me the run around and no one help. Don’t waste your time, you would think that with all the money they make, they would be responsible, but if they loose the item you are screwed"
"I see why UPS requires leaving out ‘offensive’ words.
Five minutes ago as I walked to the UPS truck parked on the street,
the UPS driver left my package roadside, 120’ from my house!

AS I WAS WALKING TO HIM!

He yelled he was ‘scared of my dogs.

The same two dogs USPS, FedEx, and DHL walk by and deliver packages to the back door.

And I was walking to the driver …….

Here is where I would include a number of ‘offensive’ words.

I have no use for the driver,
nor a company that let’s its employees get away with this. He’s done it so often!!!!!! My neighbors call ne to let me kjow UPS keft me a package at the road.

Delivery site is Plummer Road, Gorham, Maine."
I'd leave zero stars but that's not an option. I sent a package about 7 months ago and these clowns tell me they delivered it. A month later they tell me that it was delivered and it was singed. I ask them ok who singed it? They say the person singed with an X like he or she cant write so they singed with an X. I say ok was it Male or female that singed for it. It was a female they say and singed for it at 2pm or around that time.i say well that's a lie because my sister in law dont get home until 530ish p.m . I knew to put insurance on the package because. well its ups that's why I put insurance .its april 15th and I'm still waiting for my supposedly sent check. I will never use ups again.
For 3 days I had a package to be picked up and I waited those days for the driver to pick up the package. Ups is getting to be like FedEx and that is bad. Why they can't pick the package remains to be seen. Bad customer service. It seems like they don't care about their customers.
"I have had the worse experience ever.
They gave me one price prior to sending my shipment which I paid before I sent my parcel. Then I got invoiced for another 180 euros a month later because they did not understand why the country where I was sending the parcel had one postal code per city.
After I contested to this they kept harassing me with warning letter for more then 6 months although I had a case open to review my situation. They are still harassing me to this day and keep sending me different amounts that I need to pay in the post and in the mail. Will never use this company again since it is deceiving it customers by changing its prices once you have already used the service which is illegal."
"UPS Finlands services are sub bar. Can't imagine how this company is still in business. DHL, Matkahuolto and Posti work so much better in Finland."
Extremely rude. Told me to leave my package outside without being scanned. In the middle of a city... so I had to linger so nobody would steal my package. Package sat outside for nearly one hr... unacceptable!@@
"Some drivers do not have good vision, they leave packages in wrong numbers today was not the first time"
Johnny was great! He is at #6899 in new brraunfels
"I dropped two packages off here took photos of them they were video game for someone's birthday The young girl asked me if the packages were phones and I said no.

I took the photos the photos in the iPhone are LinkedIn to location and time in other words you can see the time and location to the photo

The packages disappeared this is the second time i have this to happen with ups in 3 months except the last time it was an incoming package that cost 170 dollars.


Phone (281) 362-1042
Address 4747 Research Forest Dr Ste 180, 77381, The Woodlands"
"All I can say that they lost my package and when I was able to locate it and asked them to reach out for the department at which it was held they refused and said oh we already closed the claim. They closed my claim couple of hours only after opening it.
One of their costumer service said that they do not really look at these claims. Another told me that he is not aware of the procedure of the department he works for, another sweared for hours that he didn’t have some information I requested and when my friend called they gave him that information. The representatives are completely ignorants of their jobs, the UPS doesn’t give a crap about anyone’s things and they think it is some kind of joke. Last thing after 3 days of going after my package a representative told me that he cannot discuss the package information with me as I am the recipient🥲"
"Ups do not inform you that they are going to deliver your parcel.so when the parcel was delivered we were not in. They put the note through the letter box informing us that we missed them and that the parcel can be collected from a shop 5miles away,we went to the shop and it was not there we also went back the next working day still not there.we tried to ge it redelivered but they did not make it easy.Eventually they redeliverd but because they didn’t inform us we was not in again.
So we informed the supplier of our goods and told them we require a full refund.
The parcel was again delivered and we were in because we were informed of the delivery."
"Xhit company and Xhit people works there
Xhit customer service plus donkey drivers
It the owner sell this company in£0.10p I won’t buy yes i can think about it if he give me her daughter with it
Shameless people and company"
Only given one star because that is the lowest option. Worst courier company in the history of courier companies. All they do is lose packages and then tell you to contact your seller. The entire world should boycott this company out of business. Brown is the right colour for this company as their entire service is S**T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"UPS sent an import fee invoice for my order, which I've paid on March 28, and a week later, UPS has lost my package. And after contacting the sender to re-send the package, and UPS sent another import fee invoice. I called UPS to waive the 2nd invoice, but they just hanged up on my call after putting me on hold for over 20 minutes. So I have no choice but to pay for the 2nd invoice, and try to dispute the 1st charge at the credit card company."
"I live in Albuquerque New Mexico and the UPS driver delivered two boxes with very heavy contents and he would not put them in the garage for me, and I told him I have a bad back and he told me some about policies that UPS have! So I ended up carrying the boxes myself and I injured my back more than it was because of him. I want to be compensated for my injury! That driver must be fired!"
"I am absolutely shocked by the behavior of UPS about the delivery of my package. It was sent from the UK to Sweden and it generated import fees, which I paid on April 5th 2022. I received a confirmation in my email as well as a text message that the payment was successfully received. Yet since then I still haven't received anything. I called several times to the international HQ as well as the Swedish HQ and everytime they tell me that I haven't paid the fees, I reply that I have and have confirmation, they say they'd make a note in the system and hang up. No other official communication from their side. When I called the driver's number, he hung up immediately and texted - if I wanted the delivery, I was supposed to pay 32,000 SEK!!! that number can be traced as the official UPS driver number. I mean, what is happening?!"
"Took 3 weeks for my package to arrive even though delivery within one week was promised. After the original delivery date had past, UPS could neither tell me where my package was at that moment or when it would be delivered. On the day of the delivery all of the sudden the last 2 weeks of tracking information were updated and they sent me a reminder that it would be deliverd today. The person delivering failed to ring the right door bell and I had to pick my package up from a UPS Access Point 15 miles from where I live. Very poor Customer Service and Communication!"
"This review is for the UPS location manager in Baytown Texas. I regularly order a medication and it is always delivered to me by UPS without and issues, until now. I have a huge sign in big bold print on my secure, locked, tall front gate asking the drivers to please leave my package behind the gate. They have always honored my wishes. Yesterday a new driver left a door tag right next to my sign asking him to leave it. I was expecting this medication for a serious chronic illness. After having no problems with UPS delivering this medication to me on a regular basis, I had no idea that a new driver would show up and then leave with my medicine on his truck. I called the 800 number and the agent I spoke to was very professional, apologized, diffused the situation and agreed that the driver should have left the package with me based on my large sign that instructs them to leave it. Anyone can see and assess that it's completely safe and cannot be stolen once it's behind the gate.
The agent told me I'd have my medication same day and he'd call and tell them to bring it back and leave it. I was relieved and thought it was all over. Then I get a call from the local manager in Baytown, I think his name is Alex. He made everything so much worse. He was extremely rude, unprofessional, immature and FORCED ME TO COME OUTSIDE IF I WANTED MY MEDICATION. He said if I didn't come outside they will not leave it like the agent assured me they would. This is completely illogical and beyond unprofessional. I told him I am home and the agent said to HONOR MY WISHES and place it behind the gate. The Baytown manager refused and made me feel like if I wasn't outside waiting for it, then I wouldn't get it. Now I'm scared to have anything important delivered by UPS."
"A f.cking pigeon is faster than ups, even a snile is faster"
"If I could leave negative starts I would. They a running quite the profitable little scam over there.
Avoid dealing with them at all costs."
"Bad service, the delivery person LIE ABOUT THE DELIVERED ADDRESS WAS CLOSED WITHOUT CHECKING IT. AND UPDATED TO WEB THE SAME THING. UNPROFESSIONAL FOR BIG COMPANY NAME. NO WONDER ALOT OF PEOPLE STOP USING THE SERVICES, REALLY WORST!!!!"
"Stay away from this company. It will overcharge you for everything.
You will hate yourself for using them if you are expecting a package from the USA."
UPS always fail to deliver the package to my house. I don't why Amazon even picks them for shipping option. One of the worst post company I have ever seen. They should be banned in Finland for their crappy service.
"The worst shipping company to ever exist. I shipped my computer case from Lebanon to Germany. I paid for insurance and extra protection packaging. And then the below happened:
1)They shipped my computer case in the same box I used to give it to them initially.
2) When arrived to Germany, I had to deal with so much burocracy in German language and it took 3 weeks for me to get my item out of the German customs without getting any help from UPS in Lebanon or Germany.
3) I received my computer case and it was severely damaged. My motherboard and VGA had literally broken parts that have fallen off.
4) There is was no protective coverage whatsoever and they took weeks to respond to my emails and phonecalls.
5) Finally, both UPS in Lebanon and Germany said that my claim was rejected and there will be no financial coverage to any of the damage done. They refused to provide me with my insurance policy or any reasons or details behind the rejection.

Not only this has been very stressful since arriving here, it has negatively affected my studies, my search for appartment, me trying to open a German bank account, acquiring a residency permit along with so many other things.

Thankfully, one of my family members living in Germany is a highly respected lawyer and I will be taking legal action against UPS.

Whomever is reading this, I advise you to never work with this incompetent, unprofessional scam of a company. I genuinely don't want you to go through what i went theough, especially if you are a student and will already be dealing with the entire life transition. As for UPS, you will be hearing from me very soon :)"
Packages are never delivered at the desired address despite providing all the details as per UPS's instructions. I have never succeeded in getting a UPS package delivered at home despite the vendors where I buy products having paid for home delivery to UPS
"I paid $9.99 extra to have my package expedited within 2-4 days, I recieved a notice stating that it would arrive that Wednesday, but didn't.I ordered on a Friday, I didn't get notice ahead about any delays until after I sent a email to the shipper..my package wasn't touched until that following Monday, after Wednesday passed without my package, I attempted to file a claim, I got a email after doing so, it stated it would be Thursday for my delivery, Thursday went by but still no notice, or package.I ended up getting a email after 12 am stating that it would definately arrive that Friday, I ordered on Monday April 1/2022, and didn't get my package until April 8/2022."
Just a nightmare company very slow and lost everything!!!!!! Don’t waste your money and time with that losers!!!
"So I got my package from UPS and the package said 28 pounds. It was obvious the package was empty right off the bat because the box weighed nothing. I told the driver what it was supposed to be and he said ""no its not"". Anyhow opened the package and it contained the receipt, and the packing paper. It was however opened and retaped. It is now my responsibility to prove to the world that I was bilked and probably will eat the price of this item. I do realize there are good people working for these companies so this is for all the bad ones and management who make policy. Screw UPS and all the thieving morans they employ."
I been trying to get a package from them but every time the give me a time slot they either not shown up or come way before time or way after. I trued to call to get a better time slot but the say the only way for that to happen if I pay them more to chose one. Go through that you find out you can’t even pick a time because it’s not available.
"DRIVERS ARE INCOMPETENT & DON'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS! They claim an attempt was made or deliver to the wrong address. They leave packages outside instead of designated spot as requested. If I had a choice to pick what carrier to deliver, it would not be UPS!"
"horrible to deal with my parcel deleted for more then week and when ever I call them no one know
worse experience ever"
"The UPS on Busch and 56th has fluctuating hours based on who is working that day. Always putting a sign out as to when they might be back. THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE A JOB OR SCHEDULE OF THERE OWN TO KEEP!
If you can’t run a business based on the times you show on your door or website, then sell the business and let someone who is business minded run a normal business. Always forwarding customers to the Fowler location."
"NOT VETERAN FRIENDLY
They refuse to pay earned wages to a hard working Purple Heart employee $525 after multiple requests and letters.. The lack of respect speaks volumes."
"If I could give them less than 1 star I would. My package was apparently delivered to a local ups pick up point in February, when I went they didn't have it. I called up and they said they were looking into it, a few weeks later I called up and they had no record of me calling and were going to launch an investigation, a couple of weeks and still nothing so I call again and same thing said they are launching an investigation which wasn't done before. I called again today, my package has been missing 2 months and now they are saying they cannot find my order, even though on the automated line with the number on the card it finds all the details. The service was shocking, kept talking over me and saying I had to talk to Amazon. So I called Amazon they refunded me and are investigating ups."
Horrible!!!!!! Absolutely Horrible!!! The driver delivered my birth certificate to the wrong address!! Now my personal information is in the hands of someone that’s not me!!
"United Parcel Service sent a double invoice, 5 weeks later still withholding my money with no contact response.

If you are considering a business account, please consider this your warning to avoid them at all costs. Zero contact and service."
Ups is the only carrier that has no sense of direction. Fed ex and USPS find my location every time. All my packages are still sitting at UPS undeliverable .
I purchased a couple of items online and was told to be the shipping carrier would be UPS. I made this purchase march 30 2022 I was told that UPS attempted 3xs to deliver my packages but all attempts were unsuccessful so UPS sent my packages to a pick up locations to be picked up they told me it was dropped off Sat I called the store they said there was no package there because the UPS driver claimed they dropped it off when in reality they dropped it off 5 hours after I called the store!! I never received any notifications that the package delivery was attempted they also falsified the drop off time to the pick up location which caused mis communication between myself and the seller...
"I would leave less than 1 star if it were possible. The most infuriating company to deal with. Impossible to contact. The most unreliable service. Change delivery days multiple times without reason or explanation. 'Shambolic'.
I'm sure UPS stands for 'Utterly Pathetic Service'."
"I waited the entire day, and not a freaking single delivery man arrived within the expected delivery time. I'm definitely not going to use UPS again."
"I was told I would have a package delivered on a certain day by 7:00 P.M., which required a signature. I stayed home all day waiting for it and at 5:45 P.M. I received an email saying it wouldn't be delivered for 2 more days. Wasted my entire day. Telling me at the end of the day is totally useless. Horrible customer service."
"What does a borderline monopoly with incompetent management give you? UPS.

Thanks for overall subpar service, dismissal of customer complaints over stock profits, and TERRIBLE business practices for retention.
I sincerely hope that you fail, though I know that you will be bailed out well before it gets there."
You constantly over work your employee's send them out with broken trucks and faulty equipment like diads...get your bs together 13 hour days are not manageable i know what yall do to your workers its horrible customer service....
"I’ve been receiving packages from different carriers for over 20 years. I believe this is the first time I’ve ever received one from UPS, and I’m happy, and positively impressed with the superb service of UPS! The UPS delivery person actually called me when he was about to deliver my 4 tires! And although the shipment was a very large item (4 tires) it was delivered before the actual expected delivery time!"
UPS dropped the Box off at my house at 8:09 PM didn't find out to the next morning that they did by that time it wasn't there I never received my package when I tried to climb a file claim the site just told me that after filling everything out calling customer service for hours and days on and it never got through to me I never got my package back the site just told me it was broke down and couldn't take my thing out to do it again later it was a waste of time stick with Amazon UPS is a bad decision
"Parcel arrives at Windsor Canada from Arizona, tracking states that 2 delivery attempts were refused by me. I called the local UPS they state that it never left Windsor and now it’s on its way back to Arizona and there is nothing they can do about it. Makes me wonder....disgruntled employees, substance abuse, brain damage or perhaps just outright laziness? Will never use again and will relate this experience to others whenever I can!"
Absolute Trash. I get a letter a few days ago about a package needing duties but needed to be paid by march 17th. then why am I getting the letter now? Not to mention they add a late fee and I cant even pay the duties cause their website sucks even more and wont let me. They did it to me before I figured give them the benefit of the doubt maybe a one time thing. nope the company is absolute garbage and I hate that I even have to Use them
"Majority of packages received are damaged. The delivery updates online are delayed. FedX is cheaper and better service. I would not recommend ups for any deliveries at all. A box is a box is a box, they drop-kick packages across conveyor belts and don’t care if they’re damaged or not. They plainly suck."
Alicia from the Goldsboro NC ups store # 2652 was absolutely amazing!! I had a huge issue trying to get a package and she was so kind and helpful and I finally got my problem solved
I told them multiple times I don’t ever want my mail sent anywhere besides my residence and multiple times they’ve continued to take it to cvs regardless of me signing off virtually. Customer service was absolutely no help unless I needed to know how to login to my account that doesn’t want to work properly. The ups website keeps telling me my package isn’t associated with this account even tho this very email is being given notifications to virtually sign for it. I don’t live at cvs so idk why my mail has been there the past two times and any “help” I get is just lies and a waste of time. Why is it all of a sudden difficult to receive a small package? Next time I will pay extra to not deal with ups.
"UPS have indicated on the tracking website that a ""rescheduling was requested"" at the end of the supposed delivery day. The problem was that I did not request the rescheduling, and was not informed of the new delivery date. There was no one answering the phone in there office after phoning, just an auto reply that the office is closed. According to their FAQ, should there be a problem beyond their control, the tracking information should show ""exception"". In this case the tracking information implied erroneously that I have requested the rescheduling myself."
What a ripoff. I had to send back a sweatshirt that was too large. Amazon says free shipping. It came to me in a plastic bag. I was told it needed to be boxed and pad wrapped and of course the labor charge. $24.87 to send back a $70 sweatshirt. I didn’t won’t to make another trip so I reluctantly paid it.🙁
"Just a complete fiasco from day one and never again! I paid for express 2 day service but my package hadnt moved or the tracking been updated for 2 weeks! It has finally changed today to ""Service disruption occurred. / The package will be returned to the sender"" so that was a total waste of time! No help whatsoever from customer 'care'... even though i paid for a 2 days service I kept being told that there was nothing they could do, the package was waiting to be cleared and that id 'just have to wait'!
Avoid them like the plague!"
"I wouldn't waste my time or Money with UPS because they have showed me that even if they are five houses away from you on the same road in McAlester,Oklahoma that they don't have to deliver to your house because I have pictures to prove everything since I have surveillance cameras all around my house and when you track your package to find the driver at a gas station in the back office just sitting down and talking to there friend and you interrupted them the cops are called on you and then the driver reported to there supervisor for ""Harassing"" them when all you wanted is your package then her ""Supervisor"" takes there word over yours the customer that has video and picture evidence then her ""Supervisor"" reported to the ""Manager"" and the ""Manager"" doesn't listen to the paying customer with more then enough evidence to show the UPS employee didn't do her job and deliver your package like I have and tells me if they where five houses away from you they can pick if and choose if they want to deliver to your house next or not and go anywhere else until the end of the day. And after she didn't deliver to my house I tracked her in Hearthstone,Oklahoma at a gas station just sitting in the back office doing nothing but talking to her friend at the gas station Delaying other people's packages so she got mad and reported me going up to the gas station and asking her for my package telling her ""Supervisor"" I was ""Harassing"" her when all I asked for is my package that she didn't deliver to my house even though she was only five houses away from my house on camera then her ""Supervisor"" called there ""Manager"" and now he told me since I am ""Harassing"" his driver's I will now have to pick up my own packages and the driver still gets paid for delivering my package even though she doesn't so that is why company's that have contracts with UPS should get out of that contract because on the contract it says they will deliver there packages to there customers but I garenty you they don't do that and when you call them out on it they get mad and say you are ""Harassing"" them and then tell you for now on you have to do there job for them and pick up your own packages so ""Avoid"" ""Avoid"" ""Avoid"" UPS because they don't care about your packages at all and there is youtube video's to prove everything to about how UPS through your packages around like trash."
"UPS has to be one of the worst shipping companies! Kinda funny how I can recieve items that are not that valuable but this is the 3rd time I have ordered something valued over $1000 and it seems to never make it past Hodgkin's Illinois! This time I ordered a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra and opened a case after it not arriving on time and UPS closed the case and stopped looking for my package , their reason was the description of the item wasnt good enough! I PUT SAMSUNG GALAXY S22 ULTRA BLACK CELLPHONE IN THE DESCRIPTION, WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED! AND IT SHOULDNT MATTER MY DESCRIPTION IT SHOULD MATTER JUST TO DO YOUR JOB AND FIND MY PACKAGE! USPS is pretty bad as well but they dont stop looking for your package because your description isnt good enough for them! My phone cost me $1800 with the warranty and they rather pay the cost than look for a package! COMPANIES NEED TO STOP USING UPS BECAUSE ITS GOING TO HURT THEIR BUSINESS DUE TO CONSUMERS COMPLAINING ABOUT NEVER RECEIVING THE ITEM AND HAVING TO WAIT 10 DAYS MORE FOR A REFUND OR LONGER IF THEY CLOSE THE CASE LIKE THEY DID ME. AND UPS NEVER TOLD ME OR THE COMPANY THAT SENT IT THAT THE CASE WAS CLOSED! I HAD TO CALL AND TALK TO SOMEONE, WHICH WAS A PAIN TO TRY TO EVEN GET A LIVE PERSON ON THE PHONE!"
"What is wrong with UPS ? Why can’t they get their acts together? This is the second delivery problem in just few weeks!!!! I understand that in general customer service in the USA has gone down the gutter since Covid19, from labor shortage to new hires with zero experience! Pkgs have been sent to wrong recipients although the correct is on the label! Perhaps UPS should throw the towel & end it’s service or earnestly deal with these multiplying delivery issues . The consumers are fed up with inexcusable mistakes !"
UPS needs to correct its automated system to include packages delivered to an incorrect address. I spent over 30 minutes trying to advised them that I received someone else’s package. I literally had to lie in order to speak to an individual via their automated system. This is horrible service when you are trying to do the right thing. Please update your automated system to include this scenario. Extremely Frustrating
"The delivery driver didnt even attempt to unload my package for delivery. Walked to my door stuck a ""We missed you"" note on the door and left. They where going to deliver it to a drop off location the next day but the customer service agent insisted on requesting that it be delivered at the end of day back to the original address. Well its 9pm no package showed up and its set to be delivered to my house tomorrow, probably by the same lazy ass that didnt deliver it today. Also UPS charges $2.00 for you to print your ups shipping label AT THEIR STORE. Fed Ex will do it for FREE! get good UPS im done with you."
If i can i would give a 0. Star that bad they are...
I caught ups lying to me. This company has proven they are liars and they are not honest and sincere. They swear they have experience with shipping live fish. But they have killed 3 batches of live fish I have ordered. They pretend they are sorry. But they aren't. They claim they have experience with live fish but they continue to kill my fish. Fish are not cheap to ship. I paid 50 bucks to over night next day air and they can't even get that right. At this point I'd be scared to ship a damn dog a hamster or anything live with ups. They are liars. They are complete crap. This company shouldn't even still exist because they CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT. They are complete failures at even the smallest task. They kill anything live they touch. I sure wish my small town had a damn pet store. I'd be able to avoid this piece of s**t company all together.
"Order from Houston, Texas should receive on 4/8/22 then UPS states bad weather in Az.(lie) this service provided doesn't get 1star but a horrible company."
"It's a mystery how this company can still exist. There are always delays, even when you've ordered expedited delivery (and paid extra), they always claim they have tried to deliver which is a lie since we've been home. Then it says ready to be picked up at a UPS Access point but it doesn't say where the pickup place is (it's different every time) so you have to try and find a contact number to find out. Wish all companies would boycott them and choose a different delivery company."
"Bad Service!
This company has changed for the worst over the past several year - don’t understand it. Trying to get a package delivered that needs a signature and we use to be able to have them hold it or delivered to ups store so we can pick it up - they now consider that a change and want an $8 fee no matter what the change. Spoke with customer service and supervisor and explained that the fee was more than item was worth and if I told them to ship it back to shipper - 3 states away- it would cost them more than $8 - did not compute !! Need some real time decision marking people in customer service- and in this country- to help them provide good service. Will never recommend to use them to anyone"
"I bought a part to fix a refrigerator. The vendor sold me next day air delivery. I’ve since found that next day is meaningless. I expected it from 12 to 2 pm but it’s about 4:40 and no package. I was told I might get the package as late as 11:59 or the next day.

The delivery contract says next day air at a fixed time frame. Obviously contracts mean nothing.

If I can avoid UPS I will.

Tracking # as if you care: 1Z965EW40274152197"
Worst company to use ever. I tried voiding a package same day because someone scammed me and a representative told me the package would be back at the warehouse the next day..come to find out it was never voided. And I had the voided it twice. I wouldn't recommend using them ever again!
UPS doesn't even deliver in Norway. They just hand it off to the post office (Which takes many many days just to hand it off to the post office after the package arrives). Whenever I order something I try my best not to use UPS because they are so slow and have terrible customer service.
"These people are not honest. The Customer Service Agents (CSR) should just say that department is closed instead of pawning you off to another CSR. I have spent several hours trying to talk with someone who could help me to no avail. I was told they submitted my phone number to someone who could call me back, and, here I am two days later and have yet to receive a phone call. When I call, STILL I can't resolve my issue. BTW, the survey that was to come on after the call never came on."
"Absolute shambles of a company from start to finish, if you are a reputable business looking to develop and professionalise your company stay well clear.
Complete lies within their communication.
They did not deliver on the day in question, despite several messages stating they would do so.
And more importantly Refused to take any responsibility and responded with generic messages which did not deal with the concerns raised."
Well I am impressed. The driver read special delivery note about dropping @ back door first driver to ever do that was spot on. Great job
Ups is the worst delivery service ever. I never use ups but my employer sent me a very important package and they lost it as usual. Wish I could give ups zero stars. The company deserves to be shut down for being this bad. Ugh!
"A couple of years ago I set up a UPS account because they delivered a package to an access point 10 miles from my home, without my permission. I am a disabled senior with no transportation to go pick things up, so I need orders shipped to my home, not a remote location. I thought an account would allow me to control where my packages are delivered. WRONG! I recently moved & when I changed my address, UPS system set an access point without my knowledge. Worse yet, after I found out, they then switched my account to have ALL my deliveries sent there, again, without my permission. I have been in a battle with UPS since March 18 to have the 3 packages they delivered to the access point re-routed to my home, as the packages are addressed. After 3 reps on an 80 minute call, another the next day, 1 rep on Facebook & 2 reps answering my site email complaints, every one of them telling me the packages were being re-directed & would arrive within 3 days, I still do not have the packages! I emailed CEO Carol Tome on March 20th, & she ignored my email completely. UPS did send 3 items from that order to my home, but now I have a table with no chairs, & another item I cannot receive, all of which I paid for 3 weeks ago. The table & chairs were a necessity. I never have these problems with Fed Ex, which most of the packages I order are delivered by. Last year when I did have a problem, my email to Fed Ex was answered immediately by the local manager & the problem was solved immediately, leaving me with contact information for someone who had the authority to solve problems. UPS won't even transfer you to a supervisor when you ask for one, and all they do is lie to you. UPS needs to be put out of business. Fed Ex & Amazon care about the customers whose business pays their salaries, UPS does not."
"The worst shipping service ever.
They always lose my packages!!"
"ups is incompetent. lazy, unorganized and not my first choice ever. they fumble something so simple like delivering a package. UPS YOUR SERVICE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. I HATE UPS, YOU GUYS SUCK!"
"I shipped a parcel via Parcelmonkey.fr from centre France to Hartheim am Rhein, Germany. All the details were correct as the week before I also shipped a parcel with the same details and it arrived -successfully !

The parcel reached Frankfurt and was returned to Nice ! Where UPS got a random address in Nice I do not know. I never provided an address for Nice.

It is impossibble to get hold of a person and I really would like to sort this problem out !"
"More like a scam than an actual shipping company, really strange considering how long it exists. I used it once to ship one parcel from China, it would go horribly wrong, it seems each department has its own data system so technically speaking it will say your parcel wasn't received by UPS but then you will actually check that with Customer Service (which is hit or miss) and they will tell you that your package has been delivered to UPS days ago......just laying around, definitely not shipped :D I could write way more than that but I guess looking at Trustpilot reviews it doesn't make sense xD"
"WORST EXPERIENCE WITH UPS DELIVERY SERVICES!!!!
Hi all.. it's the second time I had to deal with Ups delivery services and second bad experience. I buy online a lot of time but with other delivery company never had these problems. The problem is not the company I think but the deliveryman who tells a lot lies.. today again after having reprogramming my delivery date who was supposed to be past week they program it by there own for today Monday 04 of April.. and as my wife had a storica activita and we work with clients and on our own!!! Well On Monday we are closed and we did stay at home and wait for the delivery of my article that I pay for!! The deliveryman of Ups for the 2nd times never call or ring at the door and wait again after 5:30 in the afternoon to write that we didn't respond at his call that it's not true at all and reprogramming the delivery again for the second time!! that's really cheap from him and from Ups services. Really low level of professionalism!! Never ever trust Ups delivery services because just think one moment if you needed urgently what you bought I'm surely at 200% that you will miss a surprise, a gift, a wedding that you need to attempt, or your own expectation or own wants! Worst services I've ever seen!! And what about all companies working with Ups!!!??? Please Zalando.com and others be careful and do something for or you will lose clients with these kind of services provided by Ups delivery services. Disgusting not only for waiting but all lies telling and more write on our comments that it's our faults and make believe that they are working well but never have been present down my home or road.. and worst it's not the 1st time same all s**t!"
Why is it SO hard to look at house numbers then look on the package to match them. Especially when the numbers on the house is displayed plainly!!! I am so tired of going to different houses to find my packages!
Terrible loops in customer service after lost package if you don't specifically have to ship with them don't because on the off chance you loose the package your screwed.
"If I could give 0 stars I would! We tried to have a package sent overnight from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas, and it was 1 problem after another. We paid a premium fee to guarantee net day delivery by 9:00 am, first they had plane trouble and delayed it for 2 days, then when they tried to deliver it they claimed the business was closed, only problem is that it was being delivered to the front desk at a 24/7 hotel. So definitely not closed. I called 5 times to try and find a way to get the package, and get a refund for the expensive overnight bill when it was not delivered overnight, and I still have not been able to get anyone to help me"
I ordered a 200.00 package. The package came saying i owed 87 dollars to the shipper.I called the shipper to investigate. They came back with it was a duty and brokerage. Ok. Call ups. The break down was $13 in gst. .93 cents in duty and $69 dollars was there fee for importing and EXTRA work. Ok. I asked what extra work? Couldn't get a straight answer from them. I go to pick up the package and the counter guy tells me ya theres no extra work. They tell you that to get you to pay. Lesson learned. UPS will burn you. Oh “ have a nice day”. They are incredulous.
"5 weeks later and still no delivery from UPS , so the story has now changed again to package being out for delivery, it’s been saying this for 5 days , called UPS (call number 21) to be told issue with the address , the address was reconfirm as correct then ti be told the driver can’t locate the building —- (UPS deliveries to other companies in this building daily - ARE U LOT SERIOUS"
"I was given 9 different dates on which the parcel was meant to be delivered. I was also reminded that a signature is required. You can imagine the head ache when you are working. The parcel has not arrived yet. I rang them and suggest they should strap the parcel on top of a camel. It will be much faster. I would never use them, the recipient might not live long enough"
"By far the worst spedition company in Sweden, nothing else is even close in the amount of incompetence and laziness.
Every other delivery service in Sweden is eons better in timely delivery, customer support, handling, information and customer service.

Stay far, far away from them but you already know this reading the information on here 😅"
"Their customer support is horrible, try to contact them and you will waste more than an hour, also of course you need to sign up first"
"U P S must stand for ,Useless Piece of Schit, other wise i don't understand that they KNOW they sawck, but don't give a schit."
"Ordered a part. Shipper sent it UPS, but it was a P.O.Box. Since UPS doesn't ship to a P.O. they found someone with the same first and last name in a completely different town and County 45 minutes away and threw it on that porch. Now they can't find it. If you know someone that is severely mentally challenged, they can probably get a job as a UPS driver"
"totally useless company lie through their teeth about attempted deliveries that never happened tell you someone will call you back within the hour then don't all recorded and witnessed (bogus attempts) totally unreliable liars as well, worked in the courier industry for a long time things happen delays occur but at the end of the day we delivered even if it cost the company becase customer satisfaction comes first not profit because without customers no profit no business bye bye and good riddance see you in court if you disagree"
"Honestly this is the only delivery company that I actually don’t like. If I was able to give it 0 stars I definitely would. I ordered express for it to arrive ON FRIDAY because supposedly they don’t deliver on the weekends. As this is a medical device that I needed for my health. The tracking states since Friday it was out for delivery at 9am. They didn’t update tracking until 9:41pm stating undeliverable because it didn’t have an address on it.
#1 if it didn’t have an address on it how did you know what state and exactly what facility to bring it to.
#2 if I had an issue with the address why didn’t anyone update the tracking earlier to state that so I could’ve found a different way to fix this problem.
I spoke with customer service representatives and they were the worse as well. They will ask for your number and state they will Call you back at a certain time and never call you back :) . now I have to wait till Monday and possibly risk going to the hospital, and paid $13 for shipping and can’t get a refund. So great service UPS . :)"
"Easy to order, good price and delivered quickly, I have used Wetsuit Outlet before and will use them again. Recommended"
It is the most most inconvenient shipping company.I ordered outfits from prettylittlething in London to be shipped to Germany with express shipping (1-2days) but now it’s being a week and a half waiting for my package🧐😞.I prefer Dhl and Hermes
"I accepted a quote to urgently collect, carry and deliver a consignment of four packages, and was promised a collection next day. It did not happen. My initial contact with 'customer services was very disappointing, and after asking to be transferred to someone more capable was FIRMLY PROMISED that the collection would happen next day, a Saturday. It did not happen.
My second contact with customer services was even worse; I had to request to speak to a supervisor eight times before I could. The 'supervisor' said they had no drivers available, and that the consignment would probably be collected ON MONDAY - IF I RE-BOOKED IT.
He then hung up on me. A totally shambolic experience!"
"Me and my family would ship packages to our home with the right address, and they would show delivered, but we don’t get them. We talked about it our neighbors about it thinking they’re taking them because we just moved there, and they say they’re experiencing the same things."
"This company is trash if you want your packages delivered just do Amazon or fedex , ups is garbage ."
"UPS deserves zero stars. It's hard to believe that a company as incompetent as this is still making money.
A driver came to my address, delivered everyone's packages, except mine. He arbitrarily decided that the name on the package was not my name. He decided to not deliver it. This was a time critical business package of supplies. My package was right there, I was right there in a separate room, the driver was right there, and he couldn't be bothered. Now we have nothing!! I was on the phone immediately. I spent HOURS, the rest of the afternoon, dropping everything to get absolutely nowhere. I dropped everything to deal with it and get that package, only to get continually tired to a call center that did nothing. I could not get a phone number for someone who would contact the driver.
This company and its drivers who are smoking weed and not paying attention, just single handedly DESTROYED MY BUSINESS. that means, they destroyed my source of income!
Do they feel bad? No of course not. As long as their profits keep rising.
This company business model is to suck b2b and b2consumer companies in to signing a contract with them, then only permitting customers to select ups for delivery. Nobody who has a choice, nobody who is a consumer, would voluntarily use them. Their retail prices are way too high.
The only point of contact for help is a call center in some overseas Asian country, like Bangladesh. They basically don't know anything - they are just receptionists who can do nothing more than the customer can already do, like look up tracking numbers. And they listen to complaints, so customers can vent. It won't go anywhere, but ups prefers it if you complain to their call center than complain in a review.
Well, the dumb driver just cost my business, and cost the company that sold to me, some money. What do they care if they screw us over??"
I was going an amazon return. selected the option for UPS pick up. They didn't even ring the doorbell nor knocked on the door. THERE WAS 2 PEOPLE THERE. THEY CAME A DAY EARLY. AND NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE 2 HOURS TO GET THIS MAILED OUT!!
I had them update my address since they had it incorrect but then I get notified that they attempted delivery but they sent it to the wrong address again . Then I I talked to representatives like 10 different ones and they all said different information and then today was told I was able to pick up and the package is ready but when I arrived it wasn't there and it wasn't even on hold and now even worse I got to wait till Monday since the pick up is closed on weekends Shake my head this is nonsense I wish I could give negative stars rating I hope they get bought out and let fed ex or other companies take over since they are horrible at this.. I hope i don't have to use this company in the future ..
Worst service ever. Never got my package delivered.
"Just the worst ever. Shipping in this country is getting so bad that I hesitate to buy online any longer. UPS, Pitney Bowes, they are all horrible. All they do is drive around with your package, it can go from CA to NY and then to Mexico and then to Indiana until someone actually LOOKS at the address and decides to put it on the proper truck for delivery. Of course, then...the driver has to again look at it and decide that today is the day he will drop it off.. MAYBE to the correct post office. Once USPS gets it, the whole shebang starts over, but at least they process it and get it back on track. I long for the days when I could walk into a store and buy my goods. I am sick and tired of the stress involved with trying to get a package delivered. NO help from any customer service, they know nothing. All you can hope for is that one of the drivers will by chance...put my package in the right sorting container and into the right truck and then head to my area and get it to USPS. Otherwise, it just gets thrown on one truck to the next for a joy ride to who knows where? You are lucky if you get it in a month's time frame. Something that used to take 3-5 days now takes 3-5 weeks and you are lucky to get it at all."
"This is a company that couldn’t care less. These are cowboys at their worst! My delivery was scheduled for Monday between 11.45 and 15.45. At 19.00 I get and email to say it’s been re scheduled for Tuesday between 11.45 and 15.45. You guessed it at 19.00 I get an email rescheduled for Wednesday same Thursday and today (Friday) I’ve had an email to say rescheduled for Monday. I’ve phoned twice, absolutely nothing, no one could care less. I would be ashamed to work for ups. Please boycott this company, it’s the only way that standards will be raised."
"Tracking system was not accurate and delivery was terrible. I was trapped inside as the the ETA changed from the allocated timeframe (always 11:15-15:15) was always missed and, once missed, changed to delivery at any point that day. This happened daily for at least 4 days meaning I couldnt leave my house for those days just in case it arrived. Rug finally left on side of road not even on my property"
"you cant call any of the people you need to get in contact with, they dont respond to emails.
when you call the paid hotline... they give you a callback option which only lets you fill in a survey and then hangs up on you. and now i am for over 15min in the mode 'we will be available in 5min' the time is even increasing...
website is bugging often.

and the phone operators don't know anything about what is going on... they took my package for inspection and they don't know how it can be released... and no one can be contacted.

i think what they are doing isn't even legal."
"I ordered an item, the shipper got my zip code off by one number. I had signed up for emails and caught the problem early so I thought it wouldn't be an issue. I called changed my address, they changed it back. I would go through these same steps for 10 days in a row, some days calling TWICE to correct the issue just to receive the same email of it going to the wrong place. They delivered it to the wrong city, to a business with no one there with my name. I tried to resolve it through customer service still, to be lied to again and again. So I opened a claim, then suddenly they found my package, we fixed the address, all is good - NOPE. When they fixed my address they didn't put the unit number for my apartment and stated there was no access. I had to change my address again...I also explained that I am so pained by this the door is open and there was access, the guy didn't even touch the door handle. At this point I am just disappointed in how a company can be so broken that it takes up around 20 phone calls to get an address right, and will take Lord knows how many more for the driver to even see that the door opens and there IS access.

I wish I could say that this is an isolated incident but sadly every package I have gotten via UPS has been a nightmare.

UPS its been going on 2 weeks, please just give me my mail...Who has time for this? :("
"The worst delivery service ever. Not by choice every time I’ve had to use UPS they never deliver on time or at all even when saying they made an attempt. I mean things happen, just tell the truth lol. Follow my delivery lol I don’t know how many times I’ve watch it and get delivery attempted and the truck is at the UPS warehouse 20-30 miles, no failed delivery ticket. I have cameras and have stood outside as the notice shows up. What’s the point of customer service if you can’t even make contact with them. If buy chance you get lucky they say there is nothing they do not have anyway to contact the driver. It’s said to be true the bigger you are the less we care. Do they even care about our time, that we work or have responsibilities? I mean you pay for overnight fees and get 3 day or more shipping…I mean every other mail or delivery service never has a problem! It’s embarrassing that door dash or Uber eats can make a delivery and @ups CANT? Who’s running the show? It’s really sad that the pizza guy can’t make deliveries and you can’t. #upsneedschange @fedex please buy ups so we can get what we pay for!"
"I wish I could give 0 stars. I ordered 2 mirrors from Amazon a month ago and both were “damaged during delivery” so were returned. I reordered same 2 mirrors and they were both attempted to be delivered at 8pm. Unfortunately it’s a house with kitchen/bathroom renovations going on so no one living there currently. The next day I get notified a mirror is “damaged during delivery” and being returned. I call customer service and cannot get a human on the phone. After multiple attempts (including the computerized system literally hanging up on me several times) I talk to a human who says there are 3 attempts before it is returned. I ask if one of the attempts can be before 8pm but nope because that’s the route. They suggest I change the delivery to no signature, which I am happy to do…. but they can’t do that, I have to do it online. So I do that. Then the system says the 1 mirror (I need 2) will be delivered the next day by 8pm. Ok great! The next day it says will be 2nd attempt to be delivered that day by 8pm. This happens multiple days in a row. I call again and after multiple tries and multiple times being hung up on by the computer, I again talk to a human. They say they have no other information and can only see “processing” and for me to keep waiting and checking. Complete waste of time trying to talk to someone. Today I see that UPS has returned the last mirror to Amazon. This was after 1 delivery attempt. This was a waste of over 1 month for 3/4 mirrors to break and the remaining one returned after 1 attempt and after doing what they suggested by removing delivery signature."
I wish I could give this company no star at all. I ordered my stuff and it was sent through ups I was home the entire day. No one came to my house then they said my package is at a warehouse I have to pick it up there. Called the customer service and was told they don't know why there was no attempt to deliver my package and there is nothing they can do....come on....that's how you deal with customers??????????
"Worst service ever! I’ve called a customer care and explained my issue. And that f****g guy has put me on hold for morethan 1 hour. And still there is no response from him.
Insane!!!! Brutal service!! I’ll never use UPS in my lifetime and dont recommed you too!!"
"After speaking with a representative from UPS, they were unable to assist me and simply hung up!!
Called again and got an individual whose command of the English language was very poor, I’m sorry but if you can’t make yourself understood you should NOT be working at customer service!!
I gave up at this point and paid the damn import fees ambiguously described as ‘Government fees’.
After checking on the government web site the goods sent were of a lower value than qualified for the ‘Fees’
Today my 84-year-old mother got a bill for the ‘Fees’ I’d already paid, absolutely brutal.
To say this company operates on a whole different level of incompetence is truly and understatement."
"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. If you ever find to be met with a problem I wish you luck. Their customer service is completely incompetent.

I was returning an item internationally. I ran into countless of delays. Which lasted from Jan 24 to Mar 27. I called dozens of times figuring out why this was. They were completely clueless when it came to giving me information. You might as well track your package online. Because they pretty much just look it up and tell you its status. But when they did give me something they lied to me. They said it was cause a commercial invoice. Only recently, finding out there is no way my package would have been sent without one. So I filled it out emailed them one. And still was stuck in a warehouse forever. I called them they said it would be delivered on a specific date. I waited and still not delivered. Again they said it was because they needed a commercial invoice.. which I filled out, and found out later already had one. They made me call/transfered me to so many other services to help. To be met with the same disappointing outcome. In the end I lost money because my return wasn't made in time. I also lost money from shipping the item. Ups wouldn't give me a refund cause it was past a month from shipping. I guess instead of trying to fix the problem I should've asked for a refund. I lost $576 dollar. $176 for shipping and $300 for the item.

They will literally have you doing their job before anything gets resolved. It's not worth you stressing, and pulling your hairs over. I used ups many times. But never again, will I be using a company with such a lack of standards."
"I would give zero stars if I could. UPS is the most garbage delivery service. The drivers are lazy and have zero brain cells, delivering my packages to the wrong address or not leaving me slips. I live in an apartment building and when they couldn’t find a parking spot right infront of the building, they wouldn’t come inside to deliver my package and don’t even try. I have no idea how this company is still running."
"if there was a minus rating, i'd have given that. I gave a birthday gift package in New York for delivery to OKC. While shipping i was told it would be delivered just within 3 days. But it was delivered after 7 days - when the birthday was way over.
I called them, nobody picks. Claims is not useful - no option for delayed delivery.
Wonder how they survive with such a poor service!"
"Literally the most garbage service I have ever had numerous times. Not even once. Almost EVERYTIME UPS is my delivery there is issues. Late, not delivered, told me its delivered and have to go pick it up when its not ready. WEEKS late imagine having a reputation like that."
"My experience was very very poor! The representative I spoke to was not helpful at all! Even after I explained what the issue was, she didn’t offer any solution. And this is after UPS held my package for over 10 days!!! Only to return it to the sender."
Absolutely the worst carrier. They used to be good years ago but they are no longer the company they used to be. Pay the same with DHL or FedEx and get proper service.
"I’m beyond disappointed and upset with the company. Horrible service when my package was lost. I had to put in a claim for an item UPS lost, and wait to hear back in 8-10 business days. I then called because I had not heard anything back. I was told that even though it was UPS’s fault my package was lost they had to wait for info from the sender to resend it. The customer service rep did not answer my questions when I asked and had an attitude. I then asked to speak with a manager and was hung up on. I then called back a couple days later, still no info relayed to be about my package, just to find out the case has been closed. Still trying to get ahold of someone who can give me info on where my package is"
Always delayed. Never on time. Pay 50 $ for services that aren't rendered. Ups stinks
"I'd give 0 stars if I could...absolute incompetent service... Customer service is terrible and rude... They claim they showed up 4 times ...which they did not..then sent it back to the seller.. highly recommend using Canada Post or just picking up your package yourself
...NEVER use UPS"
Had my daughters $1400 phone (paid in full) delivered 3 houses down! When my address is clearly posted. Thankfully we have great honest neighbors and he walked over to deliver our package! Mind you we had never spoken to him before. Drivers need to slow it down and pay closer attention!
"UPS have the worse website in history,its 2022 and you have to try 12 time to be able just to log in,if its not my password,its my users id,or it just said cant login due to difficulty,They drive me nuts"
"Do not send your packages through UPS!!!! Your package will either get stolen or they will mess up your delivery. I buy and sell frequently on Mercari and I ordered a package that the delivery driver brought to my front door. He then proceeded to leave with my package and after calling right away they still returned my package to sender. They told me that the address provided was not correct however I explained to them that I have proof of the prepaid label that was created for this package, and the address is correct. I explained that these are prepaid labels made by Mercari with my shipping information that has always been the same. She told me that I must’ve made a mistake or that the sender must’ve made a mistake and because she doesn’t speak any English she could not understand that I was trying to say. I have a copy of the label that was created and it is in fact correct. So instead of UPS taking any responsibility they will turn it around and say that the sender or receiver did something wrong. They never take any responsibility and to be honest they are having so many problems that people are actually talking about it while standing in line at the store. Somebody has been stealing lots of UPS packages here in Las Vegas they have also lost so many packages and people are really upset. I am absolutely done…. we’ll take our business somewhere else because I’m tired of missing packages, rerouted packages, return to sender packages, etc…. this isn’t OK, and I definitely don’t think it’s right to blame the sender or receiver especially when we have proof that everything on our end was done correctly. UPS, plz hire people that speak English because it’s really frustrating when people are trying to solve a problem and the person on the other end of the telephone can’t understand what you’re saying and you can’t understand what they are saying. You guys are unethical, you have no morals, and your integrity is forever lost. You’re just a big company that doesn’t care about your customers…. So to the CEO’s of UPS…I hope you get a flat tire every single day for the rest of your life. I hope your dog pees all over your bed, and I hope pigeons crap on you every time you leave your house."
"1Z 6FF 637 044 1644468 After several attempts failing to go through and my local uaeups customer service rep telling me it’s impossible to get the parcel without shipper but going on to suggest I write email to him of which was the same negative response, I then called the wrong address recipient in a different country Sofia Ghana who then coordinated with South Africa ups and Lebo saups did not disappoint these two were extremely professional and redeemed up’s reputation while one member had said impossible. This differentiate professionals from non professionals, you can’t tell a customer it’s impossible. You two rock and you deserve mention and recognition if every ups employee would behave the way you did the negative reviews I saw here would be turned around. I am proud of you Lebo and Sofia. We always look down upon Africa but my views have totally changed you showed me Africa has more humanism and professionalism than the so overly esteemed first world."
"Lost package. UPS claimed the package was delivered - but ""proof of delivery"" was ""Front Door."" This is an apartment building. It usually says ""Handed to someone in reception."" Claim site does not work - kept saying my description was not detailed enough. Very difficult to reach a person. Finally got them to take the claim over the phone. The shipper is a B&B I stayed at and left something behind (i.e., was not shipment of a merchandise purchase). UPS now saying the shipper has to file a claim. I am not going to ask the B&B to go through this. Next time I will ask that FedEx be used. There are no photos to post because the package was not delivered. There is no proof of purchase, because it was not a purchase."
I have had many packages come from either usps or FedEx. I've come to enjoy usps because FedEx likes to throw my packages in my yard instead of leaving it on my doorstep. This was the first time I've dealt with ups... my package has been on 'eta will be available when ups updates eta' my package is literally in the next state and seems to have not done anything for 2 whole week. Even FedEx could have gotten me my package at least a week before today. I want to cancel my order but I know the seller will just be out money and get a migran dealing with these unprofessional and clueless heifers.
"Never, ever use UPS! They are a bunch of liars! Simple as that!"
"Payed for shipments at time of pick up. One month later, I would get a call asking for payment. I would have to pull the receipts and they would end up correcting their error. This went for 2-3 years. Every shipment I made I would have to spend an hour proving they had already received payments. Then they started using a collection agency to get payment for shipments that were paid for. If you don't mind dealing with with a crooked company, then UPS is for you"
Informed delivery due today between 11 am and 3 pm. Informed on the tracker at about 2 pm that delivery will now be tomorrow but cannot contact anyone to confirm this. Do not want to take another day off work to find that they don't deliver tomorrow either.
Worst company ever. I waited my parcel all day then check tracking info was write that i need collect from collection point try to communicate with help centre didn't help them comunication terrible. Then after couple min i get another notification that Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer coll. Ok then i just go outside and found a leaflet that i missed delivery. This driver even didn't ring the door bell and just left the note. So really if you want to send parcels don't choose ups because this company terrible.
Worst courier in my opinion. Constantly rescheduling deliveries. Trying to set up account for updates just results in a endless loop of.....you already have account/ set up account etc.
Was awating a check from refinance. These yahoo's delivered it to another adress. Said left at front door .nothing there. Unless driver and truck were in stealth mode they done messed up . Unfortunately getting a check reissued prolonging the process. Way to go . Worthless
"10/10 best service at destroying and losing packages then refusing to pay insurance.
Had to sue them to get them to pay out, awful company."
"ups is so bad, why their customer so bad"
Very unpleasant experience. After recieving a text to say my parcel would be left in the local petrol station I replied stating how I expected it to be delivered to the house after paying for delivery. After this I received a call from the delivery man where I was cursed at over the phone
"BESIDE HAVING AN EMPLOYEE THAT HANDCUFFED AND BEAT A PERSON (NEWPORT, OREGON: UPS DRIVER HANDCUFFES AND BEATS SUSPECTED CAR THEIF, THE UPS DRIVER WAS ARRESTED.) UPS HAS RUDE DRIVERS, DELAYS, DELIVERIES TO THE WRONG ADDRESS AND LOST PACKAGES. UPS DOES A FINE JOB IF YOU OVERLOOK THESE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS, ONE STAR IS TOO MANY. ""AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE"" SHOULD BE UPS's MOTTO BECAUSE IT IS PRACTICED EVERYDAY..........."
"This place is truly the section 8 of shipping companies, iv recieved 4 different packages from them in the last month, all were missing parts, tore wide open or damaged and all the other packes over the last year have been the same way, plus the delivery drivers must be real slow to lean a pack against a glass screen door, so it has risk of breaking and you cant get the door open.. place is a joke, i will never use them, and ill make it my lifes effort, to make sure anybody i know, doesnt either"
"They have stupid tracking system. The driver pass right to me without delivering the package. Even after 3 hours, their system tells that the delivery will be done soon. Never received the package."
"Only giving 1 star as zero was not an option.
I have bought a computer from Dell it got from Tamworth to a BRISTOL depot no problem, then the fun begins, it was out for delivery Fri 25th then at 1.30 pm had an E-Mail to say it had been rescheduled for Monday the 28th.

So i phoned UPS to get through do not reply to the automated section and they put you through to a human in the Philippines who then rung the Bristol depot who then rung me, the girl claimed my parcel was out for delivery but the driver was taken ill so my delivery was aborted, so I asked can you deliver the 26th her reply was I will make sure it is, I asked is that guaranteed, to which she said no. anyways surprise it never did get here.
This comes just weeks after it took them 5 days to deliver Wallpaper with the same excuses as above.

If I now find when buying that their delivery company is UPS I will not proceed with the purchase, they are just not worth the hassle. ."
UPS return is one of the worst service ever !
"Appalling, 3 days later than agreed and a bunch of empty promises everyday from customer services, when you get through. Chocolate teapot comes to mind! I'd use a racing pigeon next time."
"UPS is a customer service nightmare. I was to receive a package from Amazon via UPS and I received an email saying that there was a problem with the address and the delivery was on hold. There is NO customer service. You get a computer ""person"" that cannot understand anything. If your problem does not fit in a small set, it does not understand. It does not transfer to a human. I tried a chat, and no one responded (it is Saturday). The website is equally a circular nightmare that does not enable you to resolve anything. I can't believe anyone puts up with this."
I had a package dropped off yesterday that was set in a snow bank at the end of my .50 mile drive way. My concern is I paid a lot for this package it could have been damaged or stolen. Please drop off at my house next time.
Ups is the worst service there is. I ordered something that was coming from Georgia and it went to Jacksonville FL. before coming to my home in SC. I thought that was kind of crazy to send it to FL. when Sc is alot closer. I hate UPS.
"My event happened yesterday 3/25/22 .All day I’d get emails package is on the way .I’d see the truck close by then it was heading away Come to find out they delivered it to a house in a town I hour away,so they finally call and say I need to contact the seller to file a claim Really the driver was still in the area so I said send him to pick it up and deliver it to me that’s when they hung up .Then you try to call and it’s almost impossible to reach any one to help ….I was shocked at the customer service which does not exist So whoever has my package enjoy a very expensive piece of clothing"
"WOW, is all I can say. How hard is it to tell the difference between an S and N. For years now if UPS delivers a package I know it will be messed up. I have contacted them many times letting them know my packages are being delivered to the wrong address and showing them pictures of my packages on someone else's porch. If I can get home before the other house I can call the police showing them my packages so I can take them off their porch. This is crazy and I don't know why it's so hard to document this mistake and share it so they don't continue doing the same thing. UPS please train your people how to tell the difference between North and South. There are many house addresses with the same number and name just different directions. Do something and get this fixed ASAP!"
"I recieved a text that my package was at Durant Oklahoma UPS DC that morning I went up there, customer service was closed but they let me in. The short haired woman that was there was rude told me it wasn't there. Well the next day I received another text stating that it was there so I called the same woman answered and rudely said ""you'll just have to file for lost package it's not here"" so later I called again a different woman with longer dark hair was super nice told me it was there and when I picked it up she apologized for what happened earlier."
"F UPS!! After failing 1 delivery attempt outside their delivery window yesterday, they decide they are sending it to an access point location to pick up, so instead of waiting for it at home today, I have to keep checking a store a mile away, for a 30 lbs package, and I don't drive. Oh, and they weren't clear that I would have to wait for them to deliver it a different day to that location, so I wasted time getting someone up early to go check. F them, F their app, F their fecal communications, F their fecal service, their fecal everything. I will cancel any order sent through ups going forward."
"Ups customer service here in Nigeria is so corrupt that they partner with the customs officer to increase duty charges.

Right in front of me in the office, I saw UPS staff bringing paper to the customs office to inflate the duty charge.

My experience with them is a bad one they asked me to pay a #105,000 duty charge on a product of #95,000 that I have even paid shipping fees for and I am not supposed to pay any duty charge."
"Dont use it. If you're in america, use USPS. In all my experiences with UPS, i have not had a single package arrive on time. And, there is no customer service at all. There is an automated FAQ robot. I havent been able to get an update on my order that should have arrived a month ago. I wish more businesses would just use USPS."
It was 42 degrees and raining all day today. UPS left my packages out in the rain this afternoon and I got back from work at 10:30 pm to find the boxes soaking wet and ruined. It took a lot of time and effort to order these things and they were just left out in the rain. It's not like today was a beautiful day and we got a rain shower. It has literally been raining all day! The driver obviously didn't care at all about the things we had purchased. I will never use UPS. Now I have to contact the seller and go through the whole process of getting new items delivered. I needed these things for a remodeling project. This is going to screw that up now. Such a careless delivery. Get some plastic bags like FEDEX does and protect the items you are delivering.
"I was trying to contact you guys on a late shipment. It said it would be here between the 17-22nd of March, it’s now the 24th of march and my package has still yet to show. When I contacted them about the tracking number I was hung up on several times by the automated voice answering system then finally when I was able to talk to a representative my wait time was 20 minutes so I requested a call back. When I got the call back I was immediately hung up on and didn’t receive a call back afterwards. Extremely frustrating process and still no help."
The worst shipping experience I have had in my life! 3 words “ they don’t care”
This will be the last time I ever ship anything UPS horrible customer service shattered my $200 plus instrument cluster I sent in to have recalibrated and then make it such a pain in the ass to try to turn in a claim but it's not even worth it call dommerich can understand any of the operators I talked to they don't punch in the right information I get no e-mails back absolutely horrible if I could leave zero Stars I would.
Absolutely horrible company. They supposedly left my package at my front door I know they didn't come because we were home! Then I tried to call them and ask them to call the driver to see where they left it at and that's not allowed they will call the driver and ask him to stop back over if he happens to still be in the area! SHOCKER he's not so now they tell me that I have to contact the shipper and have them put a trace on it! Enjoy my speakers driver as they seem unable to find them now!
Even worse than I imagined. Further to my previous review UPS emailed 'when registering the My Choice application it is necessary to wait a period of 15 days'. This is is needed to change delivery day - Really great when delivery is in less than 15 days!!!
Unreliable terrible delivery time don't ever use them always go with USPS or FedEx never use ups.
Unfortunately I had to give 1 star as no option for minus . This company is vile customer service is crap to the point they put the phone down on me waited all day for delivery and now told they can't deliver and need to reschedule. Took a day off work for this . Never will I entertain UPS again had nothing but issues . Vile company
They literally just stole my package. They just declared “package delivered” and didn’t even bother dropping it off at my house. Worst courier service in the entire world. Whenever I buy anything from here on out in specifying that I DO NOT want UPS touching it. They’re an unprofessional company and a gang of thieves.
"This company offers zero Customer Service (your call is always forwarded to an offshore call centre where complete useless representatives will answer). The CS representatives are trained to tell you ""I have forwarded the issue to the department in charge"". That is it. Nothing happens afterwards.
I gave up 3 months later, after calling them 15 times . A bunch of incompetents and UPS is a sub-par shipping company that I wish dissapeared from the market. I will avoid them for the rest of my life."
"UPS is the worst out of all. Worse than DHL, DPD, RoyalMail. For example, I am home all day but they did not come, yet they say 'Delivery Attempted'.

I try to login on my account, but 'password wrong' (it's not). I try to reset it but 'error'. Cannot use account anymore. What a lazy nasty company."
"UPS is the worse company to ship though. I have been waiting on my packages for 3 days. Every day says in the next down over out for delivery arrive by 9pm still have yet to get them. Then I call and try to ask if I can pick it up since the trackings number says it’s in the next town over they say no.
But if I did I would get charged at least $7 for me picking up MY packages that THEY were supposed to deliver."
I am so tired of packages being late or never arriving and basically being told “just wait longer” when they know darn well it isn’t coming. If your company uses UPS I will not purchase from you anymore. I am now waiting on a part for my motorcycle that was to be here 2 days ago. I took the bike apart to replace the part since it says “out for delivery” and it’s not here and now says it may not be here for 2 more days even though it’s supposedly on the truck. I even paid extra for expedited shipping and it was late 2 days ago so that money is for nothing I guess. And good luck trying to hold anyone accountable for bad service. This is not the first time this has happened but will be the last
"UPS is not even an American company (located in Warsaw Poland) and
should have it's License to deliver mail REVOKED.
I keep paying extra for EXPEDITED DELIVERY and my packages were lost twice. I had to Cancel my order, and repay again and it was a 2 month delay in getting my packages.

After talking with 3 operator SUPERVISORS, I came up with their Policy stance regarding their incompetence to deliver.
1) Always blame the customer and the sender for giving them the wrong Tracking number.
2) Always blame the recipient for having an address at a 1930's existing building.
3) Always blame the seller/sender for not putting your name on the package. (Even when the sender is the Federal Government) who is sending your SSI PAYMENT CARDS.
***I downloaded their Complaint Form and it was 5 pages of Legalese mumbo-jumbo jump through this hoop you fool). Right?
Unfortunately, these foreign companies have Diplomatic Immunity and will never change their bad behavior, although the Mail Tampering is a Federal Offense in the USA.
And the online experience is a huge circuitous process that does nothing but send you from phone to computer to phone to computer and zero results regarding your package. It must be YOUR FAULT."
This has got to be one of the worst companies in the world. Never again will I use this pathetic excuse for a shipping service. Stay far away from this company if you want to actually receive your package and not be forced to deal with a group of absolute and total incompetents.
"In my case, something very worst happens nothing gonna be worst than this, my GoPro went for replacing, ups have tie-up with them, my new GoPro came in India customs also got clear but ups are telling me we won't provide service at your given location, then why the hell they approved first and in between somewhere in the unfamiliar state they came to know that delivery is not possible, and now according to where my parcel is I adjust someone, who's house is nearby of ups office but now ups telling me for their inconvenience I have to pay 1200, Seriously 1200? For what? as a penalty, still, I accepted this and then I told them, don't deliver that, I will collect it from where ever my parcel is, and again big excuse ( due to covid we can't do this,will deliver but you have to pay penalty )wow great."
"I receive a lot of UPS packages. The service is reliable 99.99% of the time. And the employees who deliver are very professional. HOWEVER, when something goes wrong- YOU ARE SCREWED! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT A PERSON! You get an automated system that basically tells you to open a UPS account and then the runaround begins. After four phone attempts and a wasted automated service I gave up! So here is the bottom line- 99+% of the time they are great at delivering on time or close to it. BUT, when a problem develops- NO HELP- 0 ZIP NADA! To me the mark of a business is when a problem DOES OCCUR (we all make mistakes) they are there to help resolve. BUT UPS seems to adopt the motto- We're good 99% of the time, but if we screw up- SCREW YOU!"
"Unlinke most people, i've invested time in actually getting to know UPS employees on the inside and the outside.

What most people don't take into account is you can't rate UPS as a ""whole"" because they're not. It's a very ""modular"" company in the way it does things.

Do things get lost? YES. Of course they do, it's bound to happen and there are people who would burn UPS to the ground for a couple of incidents out of maybe 100+.....get real folks.

Are there some ""bad"" UPS employees? Of course there are, you rarely have a company without some.

But a lot of these folks are pretty hard working and they don't deserve the bad press that some of them are getting.

I go out of the way to track/find packages that have gotten lost and there are a few things that can be done to keep things on track: Sign into their website and get their better version of tracking that goes to your email. It allows for better piece of mind and it's free.

Calling and screaming (at local office clerks) is pointless, they only have a limited amount of power and they can only follow the data given by the other people signing off on the packages during the trip.

There's only one thing that enrages me about ANY service, being lazy and doing the bare minimum. I call them ""monkeys with flash cards"". UPS is generally NOT like this but they don't have god-like powers. They can see a bit more than you but nothing really beyond that.

So accept it and do your own work by calling the place it ""stopped"" at and asking for an ""investigation"" to be done. They actually ""can"" do that and, if you persist, they will."
"Ups is the worst. I had a package delivered broken and had to pay customs on it when the replacement came in they charged me again for the customs. I called in to tell them it was a replacement and they said I had to tell the shiper to let them no so i did. A few mounts have passed, and now i get a letter from a collection agency saying i owe them $23 YA NO NOT ALOT AND WOULD OFF PAYED IT BUT i thought was cleared up guss not and they won't give me money back i payed them for the 1st customs"
"Terrible service, been waiting over a week to have lots of parcels collected, everyday I call them asking when the collection will take place, every day the same answewr (Today) but it never happens. You ring up customer service explain the problem they then put you on hold stating they are transferring you after 10 secsonds on hold they just cut you off, by far the worst courier we have ever had the misfortune of using."
"Paid almost 30 eur to receive the parcel and even if we were at home all time, the UPS courier just dropped the notice that we have to pick up the parcel at AccessPoint. It looks that its better to use regular national Post, as at least you do not have to drive 10 km+ one way to get your parcel.
Edit: after intervention they delivered the parcel within following 3 days."
"What a disappointing service!!
Does not inform you when a package arrived. Delivers it further away than necessary, even though there are closer package stations to the delivery location.
I am not sure why UPS still exists or anyone uses it.
It does not do what it's supposed to... delivering packages!"
"This is the worst delivery company. Every time I am forced to use them I have issues… i would not use them out of choice. I said forced because companies I buy from use them. If I have a choice I do not select UPS. Today I was expecting a parcel, it was out for delivery and supposed to be here by 3:15 … at 3:30 received an update that it will be delivered by 7pm today… at 5:30 this item no longer shows out for delivery and delivery date is now pending. Tried calling them and waited 30 mins and still waiting for a callback… never again I hope. Worst of the worst.

Next day: UPS did call me yesterday and reassured my that I would get my parcel by 7pm yesterday... guess what... not received. I called again today and they told me that I will get it today... will see.

SO BAD."
Received damaged package shipped by UPS. The fragile item was broken even though it was well packed.Reported to UPS. Contacted sender. She filed the claim. Her & I have had the run around for over a month. Everyone tells us something different. I've never had a problem using UPS until filing a claim.
Always have issues with them. Worst delivery service
"pay high delivery fee, and then arrive friday in my town, monday still not delivered.??
worst sevice you can use !!"
"Absolutely the worst shipping service. Use FedEx or usps, or even dhl express. DO NOT USE UPS. I sent a package out that contained a 300$ hoodie about a month ago, and they lost it and reimbursed me like 100$. Now I have ANOTHER lost package and whenever I call them there is no way to get past the automated speaker. Absolutely terrible customer service. They don’t care at all about anything. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. DO NOT USE UPS."
"I ONLY GIVE ONE STAR BECAUSE 0 IS NOT AVAILABLE Every time I have a package to be delivered on Friday or Saturday It shows up as attempted delivery and goes back to warehouse. On Monday my regular driver delivers it. This Friday i had a delivery I paid 50 dollars in freight and driver never came on to my property took package to CVS Pharmacy for me to pick up. Called and was told it would be expedited and i I would hear from local by 6 pm Friday, Never heard now they are saying it was requeste to be left for pickup. Of course they have no idea by whom or when. Ups eill go the way of Kmart, Sears and various others that failed to take care of customer."
"Please let me know ahead if signature is required so I can waive that. We are at work during the day.
I have not received this package yet because of signature required"
Very very slow. I had to return my iPad to Apple. UPS collected my package almost a week ago & it is just saying delay online and is currently in the same place as it was then.
"The first order I received the bag was slit open. Luckily nothing was missing.
The second order was received in a much better condition"
Don’t do it! Don’t send anything you don’t mind losing-
If you want your stuff to sit in a warehouse for weeks and never show up use UPS. Absolutely terrible.
"Horrible service. Didn't deliver the rug two days in a row saying the address was incorrect. I had to call them at least 15 times to say that there is nothing wrong with the address but the response was very slow with no action. Horrible customer service.

I had to eventually go to the London central depo myself after paying for the cab and get it myself.

Will never recommend UPS"
They suck as a carrier. They should be in politics as much as they lie cheat and steal. Use anybody but ups you'll be happier.
Between Amazon and UPS they are completely non customer oriented. Full of excuses and no solutions. Bought a oroduct on Amazon because it would be delivered next day. I am a prime member. THEN IPS DROPS THE BALL AND MOVES DELIVERY OUT BCAUSE THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED DURING PURCHSSE AND I PAID FOR DELIVERY NEXT DAY DELIVERY. BOTH ARE FULL OF EXCUSES. BEING LATE ON DELIVERY MEANS I DONT NEED THE ITEM. AWFUL SERVICE AND NOBSOLTIONS. OH YEA I CANT EVEN GO GET IT EVEN THOUGH ITS 5 MIKES FROM MY HOUSE. TERRIBLE
"If I could give a minus review I would. UPS has taken up my time over and over and over, waiting for packages. Paying for redelivery and them not showing up, as I'm taking off work to deal with them. And horrible customer service. Who only say sorry for the inconveniences."
Stolen package ups lies lies lies they workers stealing package beware
"Received a bill two weeks after the date due on the bill. Trying to pay the bill online, only options are 6, 8 or 9 characters for account numbers... my bill has 10 characters. How hard can this be? Your website is the worst that I have ever seen, unprofessional, unclear, and you can't even let willing people pay you money in a straightforward way."
"I got the automatic tracking, was informed every move the package made until it was delivered to my door! What a super helpful service !!👏👏👏👏👏"
"im so upset about this company
it said my package has been delivered an hour before it actually arrived. then it had a clearly man made (like if youd put your fist in it and pull upwards) hole in it. i can only imagine but im pretty damn sure somebody had a look in it and decided its not worth stealing. normally i always had to sign at delivery, somehow today it was not the case that a signature was needed neither did he ring my bell today altough i was at home all the time (im asking myself why he did not want to see me hmmmm). furthermore ups‘s claim support on the website is designed to make it as difficult as possible to file a claim. thats why i ended up here to release my anger. im sure they will ignore this like its their profession to avoid complaints but for the people reading this- if you have the choice never go with ups."
Very good delivery service - on time and polite and courteous courier
"One of the worst company to ship and receive parcels! There is always a problem when I receive or deliver such as: unable to deliver your package on schedule, address is not correct, receiver doesn’t accept the parcel, receiver not answering, delayed( for few weeks), lost package ,costume clearance long process and many other issues. And very unprofessional costumer service!"
Excellent service from UPS. Tracking information was always available and kept us informed regarding our delivery
"The worst experience with shipments

It's cheaper to ship than FedEx or DHL, but it will take longer, and brokerage fees will be substantial. You know they're a terrible company when they charge you more for more expensive packages, when there is nothing different in their process. UPS has been the worst shipper. Nothing else you can do except boycott them."
"My mother took a fall in front of her house on northland drive in scottsdale and a wonderful UPS employee named Dustin came to her aid …. He was just wonderful, got a neighbor and made sure she was settled safely at home before I arrived - BRAVO DUSTIN not only a wonderful UPS employee but a good man too
Thank you thank you thank you

Sarah"
"Ew no thank you. I don't mind paying more to have my parcel delivered by anyone else. Even damn Hermes is better than this trash

By the way I would totally them them in the face, not just internet troll"
"Stinks. When they damage a package during shipping, they avoid this being tracked by simply not providing that as an option the UPS employee can check as to why it is returned to the sender. Instead they have to use a false one like “refused by receiver”, Poppy Cock! That way no one can document their failures. Poor Customer service. Not to be trusted!"
"Absolutely abysmal service. I have had a retailer attempt to arrange collection of an item I’m returning via UPS over 5 times now.

Not once have they attempted to access the building or contact me with the contact details I provided the retailer.

Now today they’ve tried to make a second attempt at delivery apparently (which I assume means stopped at the communal mailboxes & not bothered to go any further.

Do not use this courier if you are a retailer. Just like Hermes, I actively avoid any retailer that uses UPS as a courier. Unfortunately with my latest purchase the retailer didn’t specify.

Location: Maidstone, Kent

We order a lot online & even Hermes can follow the basic instructions to access our building. Never thought any courier would be worse than Hermes, but UPS are proving me wrong time & time again."
"Terrible delivery company! I was expecting 2 parcels. While sitting at home waiting a ups van drives by, and usually they do as it's 1 way into my estate so I was expecting him to pull up on the left after turning around and he drove straight by, then I got 2 notifications telling me my parcels were delivered at 2.16 And I have on our cctv the van driving by at 2:16:57 and driving back at 2:17:05 so I figured it was a typo and got delivered to the wrong address, but it was 2 parcels and the driver signed it as received by .... my name. After 5 hrs of ringing and finally getting through to someone who could help cause when I rang straight away they sent me a claim form but it was a prize and a 3rd party picked the winners so the sponsors couldn't tell me what I won, as it would of been a number of many different things cause I won 2 prizes that were shipped together, so the woman on the phone said she tried ringing the driver but as it was 6pm she couldn't get through to him but she could tell me that he scanned it a couple doors down from my house so all she could tell me was the area where be scanned it. No where near my house, anyways I asked could she just get the driver to pick it back up and deliver it to me, she said she told his supvisor and he'd ring me the next day and pick it up and deliver it to me. That was 3 days ago, they never rang back to confirm. But that night a person who lives the opposite side of the street about 30 metres away from mine, her older mother just said a ups driver rang her bell and before she even answered her door he was in his van, as soon as she answered he waved a drove off. The woman was like well they must belong to my daughter. 5hrs later the woman's daughter dropped over my 2 parcels and explained what had happened and said she was sorry as I told her she might get a ups driver knocking on her door the next morning to get the parcel. So, I got my 2 ups parcels that were of considerable value dropped off by a neighbour I never met 5 hrs later, so, I tried ringinf the nice woman who tried getting through to the deiver but couldn't reach her, so I waited for a call, didnt come, so i gave ups the benifit of doubt and thought they would have knocked in and found out she delivered them,(but i was a bit taken aback that they nvr called to confirm it with me, but wait, Surprise surprise I seen her today, (the woman who dropped my prizes over, that ups was paid twice I made add with there highest shipping express and she said no 1 called nor have I yet to get q response from ups.) So the sponsors got back to me and later I told them that the parcel came so thought they might have told them, so out of curiosity I messaged the person who tried helping me and she never got any response back neither as they also asked where both parcels had gone to. So ups is a nightmare 1st I was given a claim form. I explained after 5hrs of wasting 15euro phone credit after getting through some1 who said she'd look into it, Jamie her name was, thank you, she rang me back before the hour she said she'd ring me back and she was the 1 who told me where exactly my parcel was scanned, if I was to go round house to house I'm sure I'd of found it, but the drivers supvisor was informed and she told me she has done everything she could and she assumed her co-workers would do their job as good as her but sadly they didn't give a crap about my parcels, the postage was an awful lot to compared to a trustworthy company like DPD these are not worth the hassle, espically if you have a issue getting proof of the value of the item or if it's something personal do not use these unless your sender can provide them with proof of value, so you not also have to have proof of value you have to leave it down to the sender to pass on them details. And sadly that's not very easy to do. UPS if you loose ppls stuff so often just ask them to tick a box in which they paid for the parcel and then refund if you can't get their parcel back after 30days. Sending proof of what the items are or if they are of a personal nature isn't right. If you want to know what the value of the parcel is do what companies like DPD do, you sign a form and value of products and at certain places they want to see the item, which is fine. But asking after the fact, and the item been paid for and wanting proof from the sender not receiver is crazy. This was my 1st and hopefully my last experience with UPS. If I buy or get anything again and see it's UPS I will ask for an alternative for sure, and btw, it wasn't a typo. On both parcels my name and phone number were clear as day do see and u would say ok if the house number was similar, but it wasn't they weren't even the same value ours is odd numbers and there's was an even number and none of our numbers matched just our street address. Awful shipping company."
"My package was supposed to arrive ""at the end of the day"" but suddenly at 6pm they needed ""security access"". I didn't know what it meant, so I checked online to see it could mean they need the codenumber for the front door - which was asked by SMS two days before! The next day the tracking site said they couldn't deliver my package because I had moved?! I called the customer service, she said the driver had had all the instructions needed - the code for the door - but still didn't deliver it. Well, next thing was that they had delivered the package somewhere else than my home, UPS customer service told the wrong address and that they will call the driver to get my package from there to me, but after the second call, the tracking site said the address where it had been taken, I called there to check if it was true and I picked it up from there by myself. On the package are VISIBLE 'Delivery Instructions:' *my door code* so what the hell was the problem to deliver it to my door as requested!? The driver really had ALL INSTRUCTIONS but still managed to leave it at the gas station."
I selected a UPS Collection point from the UPS website which is no longer a UPS Collection point - UPS would not change the delivery location until the driver has indicated he had given up trying to deliver. UPS agent was no help whatsoever and continually stated there was nothing he could do - impossible situation
"It’s already been said - unreliable with negligible credit. Garbage

Edit; 13:15 cut off latest delivery - arrived 1500

The ‘window was from 0715 - 1315hrs
The update ‘system’ is a misnomer- there is no system
It says ‘will arrive by end of day’
With other couriers you can see where driver is or they let you know how long before delivery.

I looked out my window and by chance saw the manure coloured van driving through a building site (all the others couriers know to arrive the other route but I can’t slate him for that - it’s just consistent with the whole thing though)

I thought there’s no way I’m waiting for the ‘silent knock, then scarper’ so I went down and waited by resident entry.

I went up to our tardy driver and after giving my name said ‘your online ratings are crap’ he said no comment. I continued ‘92% 1 stars! - anyway, glad to see you got here on time’

He answered ‘yeh, I don’t know what I’m doing’

I said ‘no, you don’t mate’

Ahhh! That made me feel so much better. Always stay calm, and let them have it!

I got one in for you all!"
"As said I wish I could give no star to UPS as review, literally 1 star is even too much.
They are most ridiculous delivery company ever! I was waiting my parcel all day at home, don't really have much update so with 4 hours delivery window I could only WAIT.
Fine ! I have waited for it, no one even try to ring or knock on the door and an hour or 2 after the delivery time slot they suck this ""sorry we missed you"" note through letter box!
Seriously you didn't missed me you didn't even try!!! what a terrible company, this is only the latest experience I had, believe me more of this had happened!!!!! A million times on earth I WOULD NOT CHOOSE this company! It was the vendor choice which is TERRIBLE and I'm never going to buy from them again!

And by the way the hand writing on the card was UNREADABLE I have no idea where the hell my parcel has sent to!!!!!"
"No customer service just recordings make it like UPS does not want to talk to you online. they have no problem collecting your money at the store but on the phone, you are on your own. What a waste of time calling these poor excuse for a company. going back to USPS."
"No updates.
Very poor service.
Will never use or recommend in future."
I am so disgusted with UPS I mailed away for a medical device been waiting and tracking I knew it arrived March the 15th so I was home all day finally got an email it had been delivered and the driver met with the customer oh NO NO NO I tried calling UPS finally spoke with someone I could barely understand she said sorry sorry to hear that the package has been delivered and the driver met with the customer I told her no I am the customer and I have no package so needless to say they have to do an investigation and I am out my medical device and $300 what is this world coming to is crazy so you UPS thanks a lot I hope you get your crap together and maybe FedEx will be better
Every time I order something from Amazon and I see that it’s being delivered by ups I always have to prepare for disappointment and lo and behold the package comes 2 days late. Why does this company even exist.
I wish the tracking of package and exception notifications actually worked. Two days and waiting for update information after I requested update information. Also calling them is a waste of time too.
"I find UPS to be unresponsive to damage claims.
Interesting that if you item is over $100 value they want to charge you insurance, insuring that they will be good to your package. If you file a claim....they ""investigate"" it....if you item was ""self-packed/boxed"" they will only consider a payment if the item is lost....but not damaged. I just shipped a vintage classical guitar from Virginia to North Dakota....strings loosened...bubble wrap around headstock...cushioning in the HARD CASE...case placed in Guitar Shipping box with styrofoam to reinforce the box...bubble wrap and crushed paper in boxed to protect the case within.....UPS still managed to abuse this package enough to crush to top of the instrument....now it is firewood...and I am out $500 + the shipping cost. Most times UPS is ok....but when they are not.....""forget about it!"""
These reviews explain everything. Not sure how they are so big and still around.
They lost 2x 20kg packages a d they’re not providing insurance cover that I paid because after 6 months of calls they now say it’s too late to claim.
"Whoever the guntown area driver is, is lying and obviously a crook. They say they delivered my package to my home and they absolutely did not! They must have kept it and no one will listen to me because the driver says they brought it and didnt"
"I recently updated to the new UPS App thinking it might actually be better, it absolutely is not. The reason for a tracking app is so you can keep track of where the package, parcel, or shipment is in real time. All this new app tells you is where the shipment was 4 days ago. WHERE IS IT NOW? They are supposed to scan everytime the truck reaches a new facility, but apparently they don't."
"The driver left my parcel on my doorstep - the contents cost almost £300.00, this is not acceptable! I didn’t receive notification that my parcel was on its way. I live on a busy road and was fortunate that my parcel was still there when I arrived home. UPS this is very careless and not the service that I paid for!"
"I called to find out about an item that was shipped over a month ago. I explained to the gentleman (I use that term loosely) that I only had a 9 digit number, which is a freight tracking number, when asked for one. He proceeded to speak to me as if I was an idiot. I couldn't believe how VERY, VERY rude and condescending he was. Seems to be a trend with UPS. Train your people better UPS. It's really not that hard."
they said my package was delivered into my mail box. check my box wasnt there. they never knocked on my door. claims is giving me the run around. couldn't talk to a human being they have a automated ansering system that doesnt help a single bit. worse delivery company to ever exist. don't know how they are still running. employees are incompetent and apparently dont care about the customer or the customers money.
"UPS totally screwed up delivery of important documents from France to Turkey: 5 days instead of an Express 1-day ""guaranteed"" delivery I paid for from one major capital city to another. Tracking information on UPS site was wrong at every single step. Receiving party was already gone when UPS finally managed to deliver... Originals can now be put in a bin. Thank you UPS. Will never use you again."
Didn’t arrive during their stated delivery time. Came after I had left for 3 days and left carpet outside my door. When they missed their slot I tried to contact UPS before the actual delivery to tell them I was not going to be home for 3 days but no chance. I was told I had to wait until they had tried to deliver and then there would be a link in the failed delivery email to re arrange. Didn’t happen.
"Good timing ,perfect information , accurate and friendly delivering !"
"Customer service sucks. What is wrong with America? Why is it in the Philippines, Egypt,South America, everywhere but the USA. I had to go back to the store to get service. You don't need my business, or any of my friends, coworkers, family etc."
Really bad service i was supposed to get my package on saturday i wont get it untill tuesday. i waited all day for the driver. this is really bad bad service.
"UPS is the absolute worse company to use to send anything. Not only do they never make an attempt to make your delivery, they don't bother to call or update the shipping information. When you do try to find your package within a reasonable amount of time; within 5 days, they already returned your package to sender. This has happened 3 times now. How are they still in business? Because they get money to ship and return your package and don't have to hire anyone to deliver. This is a scam that needs investigation."
"I wish they offer a negative star.
My doctor mailed me a small device and it has been stuck in UPS for almost 3 months now. The tracking system does not work at all, showing it is stuck in a location close to where I live but not releasing any further information. And they won't provide tracking info further and they won't solve the problem either. Really???? I even offer to drive to the location and pick it up but they wont even work with me on that.
They asked me to fill up the claim form but I need the device not some kind of paperwork that leads nowhere."
"I was expecting a delivery today -- I had an update telling me they had attempted delivery, but this was not true -- no knock on the door, no phone call, not a thing.

I was home and my window overlooks the street -- did not even see a van, so they clearly didn't come here.

I called customer services who told me there was 'nothing they could do' and saying I had to wait in tomorrow -- that's in spite of the parcel already being three days late because they missed a connecting flight!

After two more phone calls, I finally found out my parcel had actually been dropped at a local collection shop, about half an hour after they said they'd attempted delivery -- and that they never tried to deliver to me to begin with!

So, in the end I got my parcel, but the amount of effort I had to put in to find it was ludicrous!"
"If I could leave no stars I'd do it. Last November 2021, I sent my son, from Sweden to the UK a Christmas present; It was a Kr3000 (around £300) shaver, that he never received. I was very upset but I understood that this kind of problem can happen. I was distressed but at the same time, I knew that I was dealing with a responsible company and everything was going to be solved.
After more than a dozen calls, faxes, emails, and talking with call centres, medium rank employees and as they called themselves managers, I'm here on 14th March 2022 without the shaver, the money and with no positive expectations. Every one of them promised that everything was going to be solved immediately.
I m sure that UPS doesn't care about my case or that they have lost a client, but most of all I'm sorry for being so naive wasting my precious time believing they were going to be responsible and proceed in consequence."
"This review is only about the pickup service cost. On Monday, February 14, 2022, I scheduled a pickup, and the price was: $13.47--Base charge: $12 Fuel surcharge: $1.47. Today Sunday, March 13, 2022, the same size and weight package was $20.69. Besides the Base charge and the fuel surcharge, which went up, but understandably, was a Residential Surcharge and a Remote Area Surcharge. I guess UPS has boarded the screw the people boat. I have to say that I am unhappy and discussed with the whole corporation's business practices."
They deserve -5 stars. Poor service at best. The drivers are incompetent and lie about why a delivery was not made. They need to be out of business.
"Worst delivery service,inexperienced.unprofessional staffto handle one’s consignment,neither helping customer service,wonder how they are still in the business and running the business…."
"it's really frustrating when you pay for a one day delivery on friday so it'll arrive on saturday, just to be told yeah no you have to wait until monday for your package AND only opn monday you can call about a refund for the late delivery. I doubt with how worthless this company is i will actually get my refund on monday, and idk if i will even get my package"
Stop to send orders with UPS. The worst delivery service I have ever seen.
Worst service ever can't even follow simple instructions. How they still are in business I will never know.
"Terrible service. Paid almost $40 for 2day shipping. Hassle even talking to a real live person,had to go through a million, press something for something, through phone service.package estimated arrival time, was lied about. The person on the phone, had no idea when my package would arrive, or where it was headed to next, over a week now, for a 2 day service. AWFUL STICK WITH FEDEX."
"UPS could not deliver a package in two days if the store that was being shipped from was right next to them an the store was going to was on the other side of them.

I ordered a package on Thursday and I expected to get it on Saturday with 2 day shipping.As soon as they got the packages came up as being delivered on Monday. The package has been sitting in there Warehouse since Saturday morning at 2:40 a.m."
"I own a business and the shipper sent the items through the worst shipper in America. UPS is the worst.. stated package was delivered at the post office. Postal workers stated the truck was outside but the guy never came in. So now I have to believe the driver stole my package and you can't file a stupid claim on the freaking website it's the worst. I honestly believe UPS doesn't give a rip about the reviews because people still use them. I wish they would go out of business. Now I have to pay for products I didn't even receive . I hate all things UPS the company, the drivers, everything."
I bought an item from ebay. It was shipped through terrible company UPS. Driver delivered it to a shed!!!!! I don't have a shed on my property!!! Tried to file a claim on the worse website I've ever used..!!!!! UPS IS TERRIBLE ALONG WITH THEIR TERRIBLE WEBSITE. DONT USE UPS USE A PIGEON !!!! BETTER LUCK WITH THE PIGEON !!!!!!!!
"UPS offers you the worst delivery services in the world, with the most expensive, and extremely high hidden costs for their worst services. Avoid this company. Never use their services."
"So damn tired of getting parcels delivered by ups. Like I get a text asking if I want door delivery or pickup at some place wayyyyy off my address and I’m like no, I want it to my door. And I’m home all day and suddenly I get a text saying that my parcel has been left at some OTHER store waaaaaaay off. Why can’t I just chose the post office I live next to?! Piece of crap 💔"
"Horrific service. Expedited international parcel, small chip for a clients vehicle. Tax already paid. Apparently attempted delivery on a Friday. The window said between 10:15 - 14:15. 100% no one tried in this window. We stayed until it updated online. Next delivery next Monday. Two people stayed home just for the parcel, with dogs that alert if we had not reacted. Could have left it at the door, the house is full of neighbors,... no way the delivery actually was attempted. We or the superintendent would have noticed.
Call center super loud not helpful or understanding, tough luck attitude essentially. Whatever. No I can't organize a drop off at a store or other location, or let you drive after the van. No chance. Only option wait for Monday. Job now delayed"
"Unless you wait all day in front of your home there is no way you will get your package. Online services are not working, 0 updates. Pigeons in WW1 were better than UPS"
"I had two recent experiences with UPS and both were really bad. In the first case, the process to have the parcel go through custom was extremally slow, and i felt UPS was more on the side of the custom, then on my side. I noticed that the process was much simpler and cheaper when I use other shipping companies. For the latest experience, they did not understand the product that was shipped and because of that, I had to go through a lot of paperwork for no reason. During the all process UPS was extremely unresponsive. I will never use UPS ever again."
"Absolute crap!! Never ever get your items shipped with this provider if you can help it. They have been giving me the go-around for an entire month now, after I paid a LOT for shipping/delivery. They’re now saying they lost my package and won’t even let me talk to anyone in my actual city who may know anything about it. I’ve been told they’ll call me back numerous times that they DONT and this is far too much of a headache to ever be worth it."
"I ordered a set of wheel covers from EBAY on March 3, 2022, which said I would receive between March 8-12. UPS said they left package on my front steps on March 5th at 6:37pm. I was working on my car from 4pm to 9pm in front of my house and no package ever showed up, now I'm out of $85 because of a driver that didn't deliver as stated. The worst part EBAY is believing this crap. Because of UPS, EBAY has lost a loyal customer"
I did not havean optiin to give this company a negtive star or i would. Time sensitive tickets for a play were put on hold due to missing info t deliver...fine two days before the show. The company did nothing. I mean zero effort to contact me. On Saturday --day of the show i contact UPS. They inform me of the hold. The store that had the tickets was only open M-F. Customer service could only tell me they elevated the request and i would be contacted within the hour--never contacted. Called again same result never contacted. Missed the show out 300 dollars. I contact UPS for compensation they would not only not take responsibilty but were snide and condesending in dealling with me...please avoid using this disaster of a company
"I've been in contact with Ukrainians who have been soliciting donations of certain technologies for their defense forces. I was able to offer some of those technologies and they wanted them urgently via an address in Warsaw, Poland. I rushed them to the UPS store for Worldwide Expedited service. It was a 27 lb. package which, for some reason, they billed at 67 lbs. THE TOTAL CHARGE TO SHIP THIS PACKAGE WAS OVER $1,700 which included a $217 ""fuel surcharge""!!!!
No corporate charity here, that's for sure!!
Trying to lodge a complaint, I called their Customer Service who claimed I had to call a different number. I was then on hold for over an hour and gave up."
"I am very aggravated with your company drivers. My package was left in front of my garage! Why is that? What if I had not seen it when coming out of my garage and run over it? This also means that no one rang the bell to let me know I had a package. That is ridiculous. To make matters worse, this isn't the first time this has happened. I expect my packages to be delivered on my front porch. It is covered which means all packages will have some protection from the elements. Is it really that difficult to take a package weighing one pound, and putting it on a porch? If so, the driver needs to find a new job."
"If it was possible to give this company a zero star I would. I called to find my package because online it said the delivery address was not complete. At 11:55am CST, I spoke with customer center to fix the address. I was told I submitted this to dispatch to get your packages delivered. At 1:17pm CST I saw the UPS truck pull up and drive off; no package was delivered. From 1:30pm CST I have made multiple calls to get this resolved, I was hung up on multiple times. Finally just reached someone that didn’t hang up on me and he told me the first request was opened just never submitted. If my package isn’t delivered today I would have to call again tomorrow. I’m beyond irritated. I will never ship or use ups again."
"I have been dealing with UPS for a long time. However, their service is no good. The company will text and says one thing and when you don't get your package and you call they say, ""Oh, the driver ran out of time and you will get it tomorrow."" Then you have to wait all day for the package to arrive. But they are on the same street dropping off other packages but they have a route they have to follow. So why does the route say deliver two houses down and then come back to me 7 hours later? That is so ridiculous."

I attempted to schedule a pickup from my home online as well as by phone either way was a nightmare. The website keep taking me back to the beginning of application. when I tried to do it by phone customer service cat running into technical issues and they had to transfer money to someone else which latitude in putting me on hold forever and I hung up
"Where is my package ?
Delivery between 10-14, they say….
Now it’s 18….."
"I'm giving UPS a four. Why? Because there's no one else out there. I'm not comparing them to God, I'm comparing them to the rest. The PO is, well, gov subsidized and dying/dead. FedEx has its problems too.

We ship around 50 to 100 shipments per week. Using UPS SIMPLE RATE via UPS Market Place. VERY HANDY!!! This is what keeps us at UPS.

Downside--->
Filing a lost/damaged claim is HELL and takes weeks and there is a 54 page PDF that I failed to read that says the receiver MUST save the carton for examination. What?

The is a laser scanner that measures dimensions ON THE FLY while the shipment is moving, so I've been told. So, we make WEEKLY calls to C/S to reverse extra charges.

More extra charges---> PEAK DEMAND SURCHARGE. What? Who does this? Why do I get charged if a bunch of people ship packages at the same time?

More extra charges---> ADDITIONAL HANDLING-PACKAGING/OTHER
No one in C/S can give a VIABLE explanation other than stupid stuff like ""You must use corticated cardboard"" or ""You must use packaging tape"", So tempted to say ---> ""oh, you mean we can't just wrap used toilet paper around the item?""

So, we call C/S EVERY WEEK and have about 10-20 or so charges reversed out of 50-100.

Bottom line. Where else can we go?"
"Waited all day for my package, ups never came. went to track my package it said I refused my package and they sent it back to sender. I paid for 2 day shipping why would I refuse my package after waiting all day.
the driver lied and stole my package. called customer service and they said they would investigate. I asked was they going to reinburst me for my shipping and handling they refused. the driver needs to be fired."
"I am trying to receive a package by UPS Ground. I get an email saying I must sign. There is a button showing me I can sign online. I click it. It says I must have an account. I try to create an account, following their user name & pw requirements (crazy amounts of special characters, numbers). It says I already have an account. I request assistance with my user/password. It says I will receive an email. No email arrives. I call Customer Service, request a call-back. They call back--when I pick up, they HANG UP.
IF UPS succeeds in privatizing the Post Office, as they have been lobbying to do, believe me there will be no mail or package delivery in the United States from that moment on. Commerce will come to a halt.
Questions: Why must I have an account with UPS to receive a package? Why do they not send emails, as they promise? Why do they not answer the phone? Why must I sign for a simple delivery of pottery supplies?"
"Package delivered Tuesday, tried to pay for Duty Fees with credit card but their machine wouldn’t work. Wouldn’t let me keep package. I then called and paid with credit card over the phone. Wednesday package gets delivered, wouldn’t let me take package because they didn’t get confirmation that I paid for package yet. Thursday morning at 8am, I called UPS back and they said they forgot to send email confirmation and that I have to wait until Friday for package because they already tried delivering package again. I’ve been up since 6am and haven’t seen a UPS truck. Glad I paid extra for faster shipping and having package delivered 3 times and still not able to keep it. Never again will I use UPS. This is not the first time I’ve had issues with them either."
"Very rude! Spoke to a UK UPS customer service rep because I had an email stating my parcel would be delivered between 10:15 and 14:15 and by this time it was almost 15:00. I rang them asking for an update. The guy asked me what I wanted even though I had already stated I wanted an update on my parcel. He turned around and said “Well…. You’ll get it once it has been delivered.”

He was very arrogant and seemed like he hated his job. I knew I wasn’t going to get any help from him so I just ended the call."
"If I can give this company less than 1 star, I would! My parcel was meant to be delivered on a Friday, and I was texted on a Saturday! I had to reschedule the delivery loads of times and until now it’s not sorted out. Customer service reps gave me different information, lots of false reassurance!"
"Absolut TOTAL disaster. I live in Switzerland. I recently got back a product which was sent to the Netherlands for a repair. I did purchase this product in Switzerland and I was clearly stated on the delivery that there was no commercial value and taxes for the product were already paid. Now this cold be a mistake which is fine but then when i tried to contact them it took me 1 month to be able to talk with some one, they just kept transferring me around from one country to the other. Finally wen I got to talk with some one they said that they could do nothing about and I ad to contact another number.

In conclusion UPS as a terrible customer support, and the documents they sent me were very misleading and unclear"
"I worked as a driver and this was miserable. The loaders just don't care, the van has no AC and the summertime is brutal. Currently I have no received a
W-2 and it is impossible to get ahold of a real person via phone or email, this company needs to get with the times, the tech they use to scan and GPS is outdated and almost always breaks."
"UPS this company needs to do better it is unbelievable, reason “driver cannot get security access” I attempted calling 7 times at last he answered the phone then ask him what address he was gives me different flat, which was a lie my family was in the house all day. I was raining and that’s why driver never came to my door. Am very Unhappy with UPS it’s unbelievable. And you can see many peoples are unhappy on the reviews with the UPS. 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"
I had three packages that were suppose to go to MY pick up location in MY zip code. But UPS took them off to a completely zip code and refuse to bring them back or to my home. I am a senior citizen with 7 health issues. I hope they get what the DHL non international shipping got. REMOVED BY AMAZON
"It's really sad you can't put 0 stars, because that is quite literally the only correct score you can give this scam-like company.

I bought a product from abroad and had to pay import charges. First of all, no such charges were brought to me before I got the bill.

In the post I got a reminder for a bill I didn't even knew I had, which is always great. And the bill was for GBP 91.77, so no small cost. It was an international import bill, so lucky me.

Anyway I had already returned the package, and was told by a UPS customer representative that the bill was nullified because of the return. Was it? No, a few weeks later I got a credit note.

So I decided to call them again and ask them what's up with that, and despite calling at 04:30 PM, they told me their customer support is offline with opening hours between 08:00 AM to 08:00 PM. In my world, 04:30 PM is between those times, but not in the delusional fantasy UPS lives in.

So I decided to just pay the bill and figure out things later. Next step is to call the UK consumer hotline to see if the way I was treated is even legal. Denying me service, deceiving me. Wish me luck.

All support lines were obviously offline, but the billing help was, you guessed it, very open to take my money. I explained my situation to them multiple times but nobody cared.

So this guy on the phone is telling me payments can be done over the phone, so he asks me for my card number and security code (I kid you not) and charges my card. I'm pretty sure that's illegal handling of personal information.

In 2022. What a joke."
"I order a lot of things through Amazon Prime and rarely have any issues. However, if the shipping is through UPS I almost always have issues. In checking the detailed status of my package it was here in Colorado Springs on Saturday morning and then was out for deliver on Monday. I watched the driver slow down in front of our house then take off without making any deliveries on our street. It was snowy and very cold and he clearly made the decision that he did not want to deal with those elements. That package (a high value curved monitor) is now on the East Coast and I suspect more likely is in that drivers bedroom. This company has no business being associated with Amazon Prime and should be eliminated as a shipping option. They are hurting to overall reliability of the Prime system with their incompetence."
"They marked my package delivered but it was not delivered! I was literally downstairs at the time they said it was dropped off. The manager that reached out to me said that that driver said it was delivered, which is clearly a lie, and then hung up on me. For my next package, i have to pay $8 to have it held at the customer center bc I cannot trust them to deliver my packages. the. worst. 0/5"
Literally the worst company ever!! Lazy drivers never want to get out of their truck to drop off packages at apartments.. wish companies would let you chose who you want to use to ship your package.. even the customer service people seem like they are illiterate and have no proper training.. so frustrating.
"Can they EVER deliver when they say they will deliver?
Really!!! All the webpage hoopla, making them look professional. What gets me with all the bad reviews they get they deliver for Costco. They don't seem to care either. 92% bad reviews and somehow these guys are still in business"
"Very Horrible Customer Service!
I've spoken to 5 different people regarding my delivery March 4th, 5th and 8th. I was told twice my package would be delivered with another package I received Saturday, March 5th that DID NOT happen. I was given a case number C-0082578941. One of the representatives stated you've been in business 100 years and sadly your logistics are still not coordinated. It's awful that consumers are not able to reach anyone in the corporate office to discuss these matters of grave unnecessary inconveniences. March 4th the delivery guy arrived at my home after 8:30pm with my package. He didn’t give me a chance to get to the door. Why are packages requiring a signature delivered so late at night anyway? It’s dangerous these days to have to open your door at night to sign for a package! Now, I've received a text that I must go to a location and pick up my package myself. Are YOU SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME!!!! This is unacceptable!!! Your Rating deserves a -10 Stars in my opinion! Very Horrible Service!"
"Every time I deal with UPS is a nightmare, they lose packages, and after when they find the packages they are not able to give a delivery date. It 2 months since I'm waiting for my parcels? DHL, TNT, and all the other companies are cheaper faster and have much better customer service. Never again I will use this garbage company, worst customer service ever."
Just give people a more info about the delivery. People have a Job just like you guys...
"About a week ago, I got an email that my package had been delivered. I immediately went to my front door to retrieve it. Nothing was there. I filed a claim with UPS as apparently it was delivered to someone else nearby. It was definitely not stolen. I was at my front door in less than one minute. The next day I checked my Ring doorbell video and a man had two packages in his hands to give to me at about 8pm the previous day. I was not able to come to the door. I reviewed my Ring doorbell video and was able to see the man with my package. When I did not answer, instead of leaving my packages in the flower box by the porch (where all deliveries are to be left), he left with my packages. He has not returned. He was not a drive-by as he approached my house on foot, which means he's from my neighborhood. A UPS man came out and accused my next door neighbor of taking my packages, which is vehemently untrue. First of all, no men live there. Secondly, she does not date and I know what her ex-husband looks like and it wasn't him. The UPS man said their GPS indicates she took it. Apparently, your GPS does not work. I don't understand why UPS cannot contact the driver who delivered my packages to the wrong address, as there are only 8 houses on my street, five of which I know those neighbors. That leaves only three houses to check. Simple and more accurate. UPS isn't willing to work with me to find this package. It is important as it is a new phone, not just some trinket I lost. UPS would rather blow me off and just contact the shipper, instead of working with me to find it. Easy way out. They closed my claim and didn't even bother to inform me that they did so. No customer service at UPS anymore. I have been treated very poorly and certainly will not use UPS for my booming Ebay business. I will use USPS or DHL instead."
"If I could give less than one star I would!
How is the company still in business?
My packages, multiple, were delivered to the wrong property, after searching for them for two weeks, we found out they were left outside in the elements. Two months later, receive a bill from a collections agency for brokerage fees. No UPS, you are not brokers and I did not give you permission to be so. Try to get ahold of ANYONE- Phone, email, in store, no answers. Finally get them to wave the brokerage fees, pay taxes and duties.
One month later, get a phone call that they can only wave one set of fees and I need to choose which to pay.
Your company is the WORST and should not be running."
Very bad service. There are hidden fees. Never use service again
"So my latest experience with UPS. It misread a compute written address and made 15 to 14. Systems dind't work to change address. First call to get it changed resulted in nothing. Second time, on the suggestion of the service agent, I included my phone number and instructions the delivery guy should ring when attempting a delivery. Obviously failed to do either and tha package was returned to sender"
"No matter how many times I sign up for tracking updates ups fails to send. One can fill out all the forms, sign up for all that is offered and still updates fail. Ups customer service is non-existent. It’s all a phony marketing."
"How is this company still still allowed to operate !!
Seriously this is by far the worse delivery outfit out there in every aspect !!"
The worst !!!!! 34 miles away from shipper took 4 days…you absolutely are the worst delivery service out their…their was a time ups was awesome not anymore….
Ups sucks said they attempted to make my delivery but no one was home when I was outside in the back waiting for it have nothing but problems with ups worst delivery service ever they suckkkkkk!!!!!!!
This is by far the worse delivery company I have ever used and I have used all of them!! Ups tracking said my package was delivered and my doorbell camera has proof it wasn’t delivered!! As a mater a fact I had two other deliveries scheduled by Fed Ex!! NO PROBLEM WITH THEM!!! And they delivered early! I tried calling to no avail they will put you on hold and no one will help! Forget about getting money back they will fight! Try and use a payment method protected like Pay Pal because UPS will do nothing to get your package or money!! IM STICKING WITH FED EX they delivered my packages on time and didn’t ruin my whole day by making me wait late!! Horrible service will never EVER use them again!
"UPS Store #6540 on 18601 Green Valley Ranch Ste 108, Denver, CO. Very bad costumer service. There are two female employees very rude and lazy. They will want you to buy things you don't need like boxes or tape. Avoid to go there when a manager is not in duty."
Never again! this is the worst company on the planet. lost my package and will not return the money. I have waited on hold for 5 hours with the Philippines. I've asked to speak with a supervisor 4 times...nobody calls back! how does this company survive???!!! so painful
"Please read this if you are individuals looking at sending any shipments with this Company.

UPS and me 1 person and 1 shipment thinks it pretty obvious the end result.

1 box in the warehouse in Europe requested to be returned to me. Won't go into the details why. Pretty simple you would think

So after numerous calls to customer service (America) emails back and forth. 8 requests from UPS to the UPS brokerage in the destination country to return the box. Still waiting.

I made several phone calls to Europe UPS brokerage to understand that there is a handling and storage fee now 2 weeks of storage going up every day to pay before it it released. So no matter how many times you request a return is not going to happen until payment is received.

So please no emails telling me its going through the process off customs. That's been done a week ago. Also please don't tell me to contact the ERN Team how I am supposed to know who they are I am 1 paying customer not a business.

You cannot believe the stress and sleepless nights this is causing me.

I cannot understand why after 1 week of requests and all my phone call and emails you just keep doing the same thing.

Can noone just follow it through instead of me speaking to to 10 different people."
"Even the regular UPS drivers do not like to take the blame.He didn’t deliver to the front porch.Then he said he delivered it.With no image or screenshot.A package value of $465.He said and told the manager of the lost or stolen department that he delivered to the front porch.I signed a statement saying I didn’t receive the package.Now the ebay seller is saying a did agree the package was delivered.Slander from UPS.Negligence,fraud and bad faith.Laronda the person in charge of the not delivered stolen or lost department slanders your story.She added some things in and then plays the victim and hung up on me when she was caught.Poor exude for customer service and I will be following up on having her fired.Even if I do not get my refund of 465 dollars.It seemed to me that laronda put her personal prideful feelings in the way of an investigation.It was not delivered to my front porch.The UPS person whose name I will not say said that he put the packs behind the green trash bin.If that were true then anybody could see the package and vulnerable of theft.Bad all around."
"UPS will not even speak with you about a package they potentially either stole or delivered to wrong address, unless you have a tracking number. They could easily look up the sender's address and receivers address, where it was SUPPOSED to be delivered, but they don't care, they aren't out $600 for a package they falsely marked as delivered."
"Worst customer service ever. I went to drop off a package for return at the west shore location in Victoria, British Columbia. The package needed 1 extra piece of tape and the guy tried to turn me away and when I left the store told
me “next time do it yourself” . He was rude, not helpful, not at all friendly, and made the entire process of dropping off a package very uncomfortable. HORRIBLE SERVICE"
"I ordered some groceries from Costco that got shipped by UPS....Costco displayed the anticipated delivery day as being a day I was able to work from home, but then UPS changed it to a day earlier when I couldn't be at home. I then went through the process of navigating UPS's overly complex online service to change the delivery date and paid the fee for that service. They ended up losing one of the packages containing my groceries. When I called them they instructed me to file a claim, which I did and it got nowhere. Then several days later I called again asking about the claim status and they told me that I, as the receiver, shouldn't be the one filing the claim and that it was Costco that needed to do so. I finally called Costco and they refunded me. Very, very disappointed in UPS it seems like there's huge amounts of incompetence at every level of their company."
Service is horrible. My package has been out for delivery for 4 hours in a small town. There is no additional tracking info after the package hits the “out for delivery” stage. Very frustrating waiting for a very needed package all day when my neighbors are getting their FedEx packages all week.
"Absurd. Rather than giving a 15 minute or half hour window of when the package would be delivered...they gave 11 hours! hahaha. As if I'm going to sit around for 11 hours waiting for a package. Is UPS insane?

Furthermore, tracking DOES NOT TRACK the package on the day of delivery. What i.diots!"
"UPS has the WORST SERVICE. They never deliver on time and moreover, they didn't even attempt delivery at this time and say that my name is not on the buzzer system. They can call me. and ask me for buzzer. It could be that my partner's name is on the buzzer and not mine. They rather deserve ---- stars for not making deliveries on time and giving such ridiculous reasons."
"I recently came back from a business trip in Orlando Florida. We used the UPS store in our hotel (The Doubletree on International Drive) The manager ( I believe his name was Vaughn Gaskins) gave exceptional service. We were in a crunch to get packages back to our office after our tradeshow and the UPS store has technically closed. Vaughn was inside with his coworker Sasha getting ready to go and they stopped what they were doing to help us get labels printed and send our packages. Had they not done this we would have had to wait until Monday to send our packages and we all had to catch flights. It was a Saturday and according to the website all of the locations within driving distance had closed. Vaughn and Sasha were extremely courteous and helpful. We were very grateful for their assistance.

Thank you,

"I ordered a package that needed a signature, the driver showed up and did not ring the door bell so I did not know they were at my home! now I cannot receive my package that I NEED until tomorrow! VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! and this is not the first second or third time!!"
Been waiting for a package in the same state for 4 days. it keeps going from my local hub back to the senders hub. UPS says there is nothing they can do and I just have to wait. The Customer Service people are useless they just say oh it will be delivered tomorrow
"today, i join the choir.
i do NOT blame drivers; i know how long & frenetically they work, and are forced to work by ridiculous schedule requirements enforced by their corporate overseers/supervisors.
no, this complaint specifically aims for the telegraph-era tracking system this 115 year old company employs.
for DOG’S SAKE:
1- MODERNIZE your tracking system, and
2- UPGRADE your workforce to make it possible to adhere to your service goals.

"Hi everyone, so everything started when I ordered from Supreme. First, I already have problems with it because it took forever to ship my order. They never answered me. Then, they send me an email with the tracking information. It was supposed to come two days later. The day arrived and one hour before the estimated arrival, it changed for return because an emergency or weather. Literally, it wasn't snowing or raining. I'm still waiting for the date to get my package back . The worst part about it , it's that supreme is not going to send another order back if UPS missed my order. They also have the worst customer service . In conclusion, be careful who the brand you're buying is affiliated with . I have seen so many people changing for another product because as soon as they see UPS , they know how bad their experience is going to be. Brands need to stop working with UPS seriously!"
"I am tired of shipments being left on the ground in the weather, or in the weeds at the end of my driveway. I also haven't received a shipment on time or at the right location in five years or better.(since way before covid. Therefore not a viable excuse) If you can't do a better job delivering peoples orders maybe you should leave the private sector and become a government run agency. At least I expect them to fail, therefore I'm never disappointed. The sad part is that I very rarely have a shipping choice anymore."
Horrible experiences getting packages. Amazon and Fed Ex have no problem finding us UPS can’t get it done.
"If I could give no stars I would.. item was to be delivered yesterday.. never got it and the tracking wasn't updated till the morning saying waiting for a time.. I then wait for another email and it said delivery was expected between 2pm-6:15pm... I live in the basement and they ended up apparently coming to the ""front door"" at 9:25am this morning... what's the bloody point of delivery if it doesn't get delivered?? Your a delivery company.... do your job right. The updates online aren't even accurate at all!! Now I have to waste time out of my day and gas to pick it up when I have a pregnant wife to worry about... Oh wait... not till I get ANOTHER notification threw email will it be ready at the store.. so now I'm waiting longer... UPS delivery SERVICE SUCKS!!!"
"Complete joke, says we were not home when we were two waiting for the delivery no truck ever came in front of the house ever and nobody reply on the phone. Other companies were perfectly able to deliver on the same date...hopefully this company disappears"
"How such company is able to survive bankruptcy ? absolutely shi**y service. Service is terrible, they say they tried but missed the delivery because guess what ""I was not home"", but I was all the time. Try to login using my account, guess what, it does not work anymore, and can not reset the password because their stupid system developed by underpaid employees is crap as their service is."
"Representatives are very rude. I requested a call back numerous times, after waiting I was hung up on almost everytime. For some reason I was not allowed to have my package delivered to a different address, even after explaining I had a package stolen from my Porch."
I'm really upset you can never deliver a package on time or to my door I need my package today and you marked as if I'm not home! terrible service
"Very bad service, never ever any shipment witn then"
"Always gets a bad customer service and hires no commonsense staff, drivers are so lazy to deliver the package to the customer and prefer to leave a tag instead and let the customer pick it up on theyre depot. Nothing beats Canada post on customer service!"
"The company I ordered through used UPS, first they could not find my house when delivering my package so had to have it delivered to the deport. Called to have the name switched over to my boyfriends name the person told me i could pick it up at the deport what ever i explained that i did not go to town that he works in town. I was then told i could have it delivered i explained that they could not find the house and i just want the name switched over then he again said i could pick it up anytime at the depo...... very unhelpful if I could give them 0 i would but I cant so ai give it a 1"
"Wanted to ship package from UK to China. Package got stuck in UPS Shenzhen China for several weeks and still in progress of getting some sort of documentation like receipt, what it's made of, what materials and what inside and ect. Come on! I described everything in invoice clearly, described what inside and how much it cost and plus it's a birthday gift which haven't arrived to person in China! So disappointed, customer and complain center just promising and doing nothing, export department just sending pointless emails asking we need receiver to supply documentation.... Even receiver have supplied two times already and today again.... Wish I have used FedEx, DHL or other shipping companies"
"UPS (2336 SE Ocean Blvd, Stuart, FL 34996) Stolen money in a graduation card. ($800.00) made an appointment as per the (different employee) assistant manager's request to review the security video; however, when we showed up for the appointment; owner Craig who assisted with the mailing of the money gift that was stolen, he did not show up for the video review of us mailing gift with his assistance. A full police report can be found at the Stuart, Florida, Police Department, located at 830 SE M.L.K. Jr Blvd, Stuart, FL 34994"
"One star to many, Waited 4 hrs on Friday (25 Feb 08.45-12.45) for delivery, nothing until contacting them by phone and then informed delivery Monday same time.
Nothing. Contacted them again told it would be delivered on Tuesday (after waiting at home 4hrs) Now Tuesday the same, no contact no email. Now being sent Wednesday. Such poor service. No excuse. In future if a company use them, will go elseware"
You are a terrible shipping company. You blame your customers and lie saying they never dropped off the package when in reality you've had the package for 5 days and because of your own issues have failed to ship a PERISHABLE product in the 2 days that was promised. Now my product will be stale. You should apologize to the company that enlisted you and who you not only failed to do your job but then lied and blamed the customer. Shame on you!
"Only giving 1 star as I can't give zero.

Sent 2 parcels that arrived with the contents smashed to bits. Even with the extra insurance I paid for they refused my claims saying that the parcels couldn't be inspected. (The receipent held on to the parcels for 4 weeks.)

So hard to contact customer services, and when I did get through they just sent the same email telling me that my claim had been denied. Didn't even refund my shipping costs. I will never use them again."
"they never update their tracking information, one package i got had frost damaged contents, their customer service online barely ever help in any way, and mostly repeat the same thing"
"I had an issue with delivery. Things changed on the day of delivery and I wouldn't be able to be home to sign. I contacted the seller and changed to no signature. I called the UPS rep to inform them and get confirmation that my package would be dropped off in a safe spot. The rep was unwilling to work with me, and in a ""nice"" way, was pretty much told that it sucks to be you. They couldn't relay any message to the delivery person or wouldn't and now I'm stuck not having my package delivered and possibly unable to pickup for a week. Then I was informed it'll most likely be sent back to the shipper WHICH IS IN INDIANA and I live in NORTH CAROLINA. I was told I could just go pick it up at the seller. These reps have to actual clowns sitting behind the desks. Give me a break. These are the same people that want to make more money but are unwilling to budge to help their customers. Give me a break."
Terrible customer service and also can’t fix anything they ruined. I spent an hour waiting to talk to someone only for them to tell me that they can’t do anything about it. I cannot stand how awful this company is it’s right there with USPS. Might as well be them.
"I am starting my new job, my company shipped me my laptop, which supposedly deliver at Michaels UPS Access point, Cypress TX. I have been going back an forth with Michaels and UPS from last 2 days, now UPS telling me I wont be able to get the laptop until 2 days. You damn UPS, how do I start my new job without laptop."
"I remember 10 yrs ago Ups was on time.

Now it’s rarely on time. Weather delays here which I understand. 10 yrs ago it would’ve been delivered yesterday though completely clear. Fed ex delivered several days early today but ups says still weather delay"
I would just like it if you could update where packages are before the weekend so we’re not anxiously wondering if it will come in Monday .
"Two words: NEVER AGAIN!
They put me through hell."
UPS is unreliable and is a completely crappy delivery service. I will only order from Amazon in the future. If I have to order from another vendor I will have it sent to the store and pick it up. I strongly recommend to never use UPS because they are one of the most horrible delivering services on the face of the planet.
"The driver let my package outside, never call me or ring the bell to advise me.
I never find the package when back home.
Open a ticket, ups told me that i will not be informed about the issue because I am the receiver and not the shipper.
Problem, the shipper is in foreign country and refuse to refund me because UPS lost the package and he is not responsive of the lost……

I will never use this service again"
"If I could rate zero stars I would. I paid $70 to have a check for $50 delivered over night for the next morning. It never got there so I went to the office to complain. They Said I took it after the time for next delivery which was a lie because I sent in the morning, plenty of time for the next day. So they said the driver picked it up late and they had no control of drivers. They said it would be delivered the following morning. Well, the letter wasn’t delivered the again the next morning and since it was Saturday it wouldn’t be delivered until Monday. This was a time sensitive mail that caused me major issues. The only consolation was that they said I would get reimbursed what I paid but I still had issues with the check being late. Awful service, never again."
"I visited UPS store in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, today, Saturday Feb. 26, 2022, just at last minute @ 3:00 pm, when the store was closed. I just needed to print my travel documents that I got today from my destination country, but my printer was out of ink and I needed my documents ASAP, as my flight was 9;00 am, tomorrow. I was travelling to visit my son after 2 years of Corona Virus restrictions.
The gentleman who was at work, heard that I was trying to open the door and kindly opened the door and lets me in, without a question. He kindly helped me, and printed my documents , as I didn’t know how to do it, without complaining of that I came late. When I was going to pay, he told that he can’t charge me as the store was closed already. I told him to pay cash but he said he can’t get cash.
I was surprised and much thankful of his caring and kindness.
I left the UPS store tearfully with my heart full of joy, to find that:
Still there are caring and kind people in the world that brightens your life.
He was an angle for me today, that made it possible for me to fly and visit my son.
I wish him all the best in his career and in his life.
Thankful Ancaster UPS store customer."
"This shipping company is absolutely the worst. The problem with buying items online, you cannot specify which shipping company the online retailer uses. So I paid extra for 2 day shipping and today Saturday was the day to receive my package. I literally stayed home all day so I would not miss the package. I live in an apartment complex that is gated. When you pull up, you just put the person's name in the intercom panel and it dials the person. So I get an email notification that ""sorry we missed you, but the business was closed."" First of all, this isn't a business so why are you lying. Second, just put the name in the intercom and it would have called me and then I can walk out to you. Now I have to wait until Monday to have the attempt a redelivery and the same thing is going to happen again. I spoke with someone at customer service and said that I can pay $7.99 to upgrade to their higher level of service and then I can pick up the package at another location. So I have already paid extra to have 2 day shipping, now I have to paid another $8 to then have to drive about 20 minutes so that I can pick up the package. These companies need to stop screwing over their customers. There is no accountability anymore. Someone please tell my why the poor driver cannot type my 10 letter name in an intercom? And btw, there is no place in their online portal to give instructions to the driver even though their website says you can give instructions...you have to upgrade to the $7.99 scam that they going on. You suck UPS!! Good riddance to bad rubbish."
"I was expecting a package delivery this week and received 3 emails confirming the delivery. I was not only at home working only a few feet from the door, but I also have a doorbell camera. The package didn't show up and instead I got an email saying it was being returned to sender because I had refused delivery. Lie #1. I called customer service and spoke to an agent who kept changing what she said. After putting me on hold for the 3rd time, she said delivery had been rescheduled for the following morning. Lie #2. My package had already travelled by boat to leave the island I'm on and was loaded onto a trailer to be re-shipped across the country. I then spoke to a second agent who said it was returned because it was improperly packed. I'm assuming that means they dropped it and ran over it a few times because the packing, which actually was good, was sufficient for pickup at the source, driven across the country, processed here, and put on a truck for delivery. And then it suddenly wasn't?? To add salt to the wound, they charged another $355 to my credit card today for the return shipping. I'm now at almost $750 with UPS and they didn't even attempt delivery. I've been told they can't do anything about it until it arrives back with the shipper. At that point I will have to complete a claim for any damages and I will be demanding a full refund of every penny they charged me, as I got nothing for it except stress, frustration and a wicked headache. Additionally, I had to reorder the items that I could (although not all are still available) because it is time-sensitive. That means I've incurred the additional costs for duplicate items and more shipping - definitely not through UPS! If they refuse the refund, I will be disputing it with my credit card and filing a complaint with BBB. Absolutely shocking service from them and disappointing that their employees are not truthful."
Delivered ahead of schedule and delivery driver polite and helpful.
"Driver made no attempt to deliver and just said I had refused delivery. All on cctv covered property, package then re scheduled for a pre 12 today to then be told it was not loaded onto the van!
Absolute shambles. I will NEVER use these again and will be advising no one else does either."
"UPS is the worse delivery service provider ever! I paid extra $$$ to have my package delivered by 10:30 am the next morning. They never showed. When I checked the tracking number it stated that the package will be delivered the following morning by 10:30. The delivery man buzzed, I answered the phone he hang up and left. Called customer service they informed me that they will return between 6-8pm due to the urgency of the the package. Called back they told me the same thing between 6-8. At 7:30 I called again, now the tracking number doesn't matches up. Apparently he was checking the wrong screen, now he's telling me I have to pick up the package at the depot the next day. Eventually a so called manager came on the phone just to let me know I have zero chance of getting the package today, with no apologies. Even though the contents of the package is seizure medication for autistic son, they could care less.These people are unbelievable, unreliable and not trustworthy at all. Never again!!!!"
"UPS delivery sucks!! Attempted delivery today of 2nd Day Air, rang doorbell ONLY once, no knock, then scanned, left note and took off. Not even an attempt to ring twice or knock.
This the 2nd time UPS does this, they absolutely SUCK!!!
I have asked my vendor to offer Fedex option, will NOT use UPS again."
"They leave packages at the door requiring signature without even checking if someone is home. They just tag a random signature to ""justify"" packages were supposedly checked in. They also almost always deliver late & customer service is nonexistent."
"Why UPS service delivery all packages place at lobby unsecured area, I lost my $200 6lb H&M clothing for my two kids. But, the report said placed at front door, and I'm all day at home with kids. VERY UPSET THE service."
"Worst delivery service I have ever seen.
Charged $270 for overnight but the package never delivered even 3 business days.
All they can say is sry for delay.
This is second time bad experience."
So done with them losing my packages. Mailed to my daughter her work blazer (which is no longer made) for a prestigious event and it never arrived. How can you be a company whose sole mission is to mail stuff .... and not get it to its destination.
"404-828-4900 UPS Corporate Customer…

When ordering from vendors let them know that UPS has become a persistent problem and DO NOT SHIP UPS. If you have to put ""DO NOT SHIP UPS"" before your name on the address."
"I have sat in the house for two days now waiting for a small parcel delivery. Yesterday, I watched the UPS truck drive up my cul-de-sac and leave a few minutes later…no call, no messages, not once trying to reach me. Today, I go online into tracking and they already have bumped the delivery to tomorrow. I’m so pissed off right now. NEVER USE UPS!!"
"Worst place to ship, be prepared to lose your shipment when you ship with ups"
"To whom it may concern within the UPS organization.
I have a question; I thought that your company really was a legit delivery company that really did a great job. But now, after using your services, and after talking to your customer service agents my good view for you as a company has disappeared for good!!!
You have a customer service that is out from this world, when you talk to these agents they act like they don't know anything. The only answer you get is that ""yes sir"" "" I understand sir"" , Sorry sir"" "" I can't do anything 2 help you sir u have to wait"" just excused no action.
I have emailed your customer service at least 10 different times, I have sent a FAX 4 times, I have called and spent at least several days in total to waste my time.
Your employees steal packages and then we customers have to wait for over 2 months before you can solve a claim issue even do you have approved a claim etc.
Also, when I looked in general how happy your customers are, over 92 % of all of the reviews you have are ""negative"".

Why not take this seriously and do something about it, I mean if you still want to operate as a company... I will for sure do anything in my power to spread the information about how bad UPS is as a company and EVERYONE using your servicers should stop with it immediately and choose another carrier."
"bad service , information provided ,customer service in worthless"
Item was collected two days late and I wasted much time on the telephone contacting them. Very unhappy with UPS and would not use them again. I was forced to stay at home for three days for them to collect one rug.....Keith Masson.
UPS in my experience is a long-winded way to receive your package.
"I bought some window blinds on Amazon.ca and I guess the seller used UPS. My Amazon invoice states standard shipping. A month later UPS sent me a bill for $22 for shipping. I ignored it since I did not choose UPS and had chosen standard shipping. If the seller used UPS they should pay UPS. Then UPS sent it to a collection agency and threatened my credit rating. This seems like extortion. If a company in China used them and did not pay, how is it my responsibility? Again I never chose them to deliver my package. Now I will stop using them for my own business, will write several bad reviews, call and complain several times and make sure it costs them more than the $22 they wrongfully extorted from me. Good move UPS. Dumb business decision."
"The forwarder in Japan chosen UPS instead of DHL for a strange reason(baggageforward.jp, but don't use them, they are as bad as UPS). The shipment was dispatched From Japan on Feb 17, 2022, have absolutely no idea why they can't just shipped straight to Hong Kong, but no, they will get the most indirect route to GZH and then to SZX and to Hong Kong. Ok, if this worked it would take only an extra day, but again sxxt happens, they were not allow to get the shipment through the border and it took them three days to figured out what to do next. Until today Feb 24, 2022 (shipment arrived at HKG on Feb 23, 2022), they still not sure whether it will be delivered today or not. Someone just called me and advise they will need another day to clear custom and distribution. So If luckily tomorrow I'll get the shipment it will be totally 9 days. If it were a seamail it would be here already."
"Driver won't deliver during business hours, doesn't leave sticker on door, and returned to sender after never ringing my doorbell. Their phone number and website are utterly useless."
The worst shipping service ever. No one should ever use this terrible service. They are simply scammers and full of bs. Ups would be better of extinct seriously!!
"My package arrived to Las Vegas on 2/21/2022 at 9:13 pm and as today 2/23/2022 at 3:52 pm hasn't been delivered, is ridiculous that my package has been all around Vegas for 42 hours with the risk of getting damaged, there is a lot of room to improve how you do your business, is going to be hard to me to consider using your services in the future. 1ZX85A49YW72012661"
"I do not see how UPS is still in business! UPS no longer has a customer service depart, they can not deliver a package undamaged, will not provide accurate or adequate tracking information nor will they honor their lost/damage insurance policies. UPS will spend more time in an attempt to avoid paying a claim than trying to do their actual jobs!
I would not send a stool sample via UPS!"
"Don't get me wrong UPS is indispensable however UPS doesn't want to make recommendations easy so I'm resorting to Trust Pilot to share a valuable idea. UPS needs to notify in advance if the package is handed off to the low security USPS so that customers have the option to pay a little more $1. Also because the USPS locker may be miles apart from the customers intended delivery prompting an unnecessary lost package report and a huge waste of time and aggravation for the customer. If UPS wants to save a buck fine just let the customer know instead of making it a hoop jump to find out where. A simple USPS logo with the new tracking number is all that has to be included in the notification. Not doing so creates a demand for another shipper that will. So there you have it an idea worth about a million in promotional and real value.

"When sending a card to New York from North Carolina someone opened it stole the card out of it and left what looked like a fake postal service note saying ""We Care"". The card did not have the postmark date it only was the envelope that was received along with the We Care note from the postal service with no name no phone number no email no anything. I can't even get a real person on the phone although I've called several different numbers. It brings me back to virtual assistant and if I do not pick one of the five choices the virtual assistant just hangs up."
"UPS sets up the delivery, but you have to wait for the whole afternoon to see if they will actually deliver the item, since they will not tell you within an hour or two when they may be doing the actual delivery I will not use them again, and am considering getting it shipped back to the vendor so they can use another shipper"
"I have no words to express my frustration and anger at the AWFUL International customer service. Besides F(&*(&$#&(#*_$@#$!!!

The hold times and the unsympathetic personnel that attended my call, very disappointing.

COVID not only has killed people, but it has killed U.P.S. Customer Service."
"I'd give 0 stars if I could they have no idea where my package is and are making no attempt to find it even though it contains 15,000$ in value"
"I have posted several reviews at different places, but it is all the same. I have yet to receive the items that were sent 2-day in 2-days. The email always shows up stating a delay. Sometimes the driver doesn't bother to check the truck for multiple shipments and drops off one and never bothers to come back and deliver the others. My conclusion is: UPS does not care about customer service. Believe it is due to upper management creating a lousy work environment thereby generating a workforce that just does the job but at a minimum. I avoid taking a shipment from a vendor shipping UPS and always request FedEx. USPS is another topic but sure is depressing when they lose $15 Billion a year of tax dollars but they do better than UPS."
"I’ve gone to the UPS store several times located 430 George Wallace Dr
Gadsden, Al 35903. The people working there are so friendly, polite, helpful and professional. If you need to mail anything I strangle recommend this store. And, they will print a label at no cost. I give this store 5 stars.

"Over a month ago UPS lost my package --l initiated an ""investigation"" and never heard back about it. Still no package and they totally don't care. My local office where it was sent refused to help at all -- happy to collect the fee, but absolutely no help in finding my package or, heaven forbid, a refund. I called a 'Help"" line and they wanted me to pay an additional fee to find the package that THEY LOST!!!"
"Just awful, one of my packages was supposed to get delivered home, driver never called for me to pick it up, second package that was supposed to be delivered yesterday or the day before yesterday because I had payed 20€ extra didn’t get delivered but instead I got a message saying it was supposed to get delivered today between 14:00 and 18:00, I get a call at 12:58 which I could not answer because I was at work and then it says I wasn’t available to pick up, it was supposed to get delivered 14:00-18:00 again not 12:58! Then I call and the costumer service is just awful, not helpful at all but instead more confusing, 1 worker says it will be delivered on Saturday, then the other says tomorrow and another says I can pick it up at a pick up point. Moral of the story don’t choose ups and never pay extra to get it delivered sooner, just a waste of money and at the end of the day I still got it around the time it would take to not pay that extra cash. If I could give 0 stars I would, especially if there was a possibility to give minus!"
The driver didn't even get out of his truck. Sat there for a minute. Marked the package as could not be delivered and then drove off. I was sitting in my Kitchen and it said he was driving up. If I known it was going to a problem I would of just walked out there to him.
I needed to overnight keys to my father. I've arrived late in the afternoon in the UPS Store at 60 29th Street in San Francisco. Alfred at the desk was brilliant. He rushed my package through for a driver that was about to leave. The keys arrived at 8am in Las Vegas the next day.
"UPS your driver just dropped off to the wrong house again! I said you need to read the full address. (Been dealing with this for years) He told me to ""get back in your house!""
Utah plate C06 0NE
They speed around our private community. I can't get ahold of customer service. 02/22/2022"
"Update. 3-11-22. UPS denied my dispute for the remaining bottles. They said if they’re not broken, they’re acceptable - even though 2 of the bottles are leaking and all have cap damage. Clearly they can’t be used as the gifts they were intended for. It’s also crystal clear this package was handled super rough.

Amy of the Lexington, NC UPS office disagreed and was gracious / professional and decided they would stand behind their ship and pack guarantee. She is refunding me the full value assigned to this package.

I cannot speak to anyone in the claims department but their customer service is clearly non-existent. What’s the point of assigning a value for a package when they clearly don’t take responsibility for a damaged package.

Thank you Amy for doing the right thing!!!

Mary Stefanik




I had a package shipped from NC to ME with delivery on 2-17 containing 17 bottles of wine. Inspectors said 10 bottles were fine. Two of these 10 bottles were leaking. NC store disputed these two leaking bottles. My niece picked up these 8 bottles. Remaining 8 bottles had crushed-bent tops. I disputed these 8 bottles. These bottles were purchased as gifts - in their condition they cannot be given as gifts.

Declared value was $300

Shipping cost was $139.81

Claim was initially approved for only 7 bottles and the shipping cost. I have no idea how the inspector could possibly say the remaining 10 bottles were acceptable.

I am being told claim resolution can be as much as 6 months. I was given customer service number that won’t transfer me to a rep then disconnects.

I sent all this info to UPS via FB a message asking if someone please help me resolve this so I can get my money back?

Thus happened on 2-17. Today is 2-22."
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I was expecting a package yesterday and was home waiting. I was very surprised to get a notification that I had an attempted delivery and that it was going to the store for pick up. The driver never knocked, called UPS customer service and explained what happened, I was told I would be able to pick up my package same day and it would be $8, great, paid. It showed I would be able to pick up from the location right up the road, it was not at the location when I called an hour before closing. Looked this morning and it's at a location 40 minutes from me. called customer service again only to be told it would be $8 more to have it redelivered to me. NO! I will not wait only for there to be another attempted delivery! UPS sucks and needs to work on hireing people to do their job correctly!!"
"UPS has been the worst shipping experience that I have ever had. No updates, No Contact, No Reply. This company should be terminated as soon as possible."
Rude and uncooperative behavior by UPS delivery drivers.
"The worst service ever. I am really fuming because you have lost my package I paid 400 dollars for the shipping package and they lost my package and it was very valuable things I have sent to my family 😡
What I got now is to file claim .
I want my lost package."
"I am very disappointed to say the least. I was scammed when I engaged in selling a never been worn wedding dress on Facebook market place. When I realized that the email I recieved from cash app was a fake. I fact there was no such pending $600.oopayment for the dress. Promptly I innishiated canceling the delivery. The costomer service stated that they where not able to cancel the shipment at that time, for the package was not in there system. Being the weekend first thing Monday morning I went to the Rhonert park UPS to cancel the shipment. Speaking to employees John. I was assured return shipment was possible. My package would be returned to my Guerneville residence. As enough time passed for the return of the dress. Not recieving the dress. I phoned UPS whom informed me the dress had been delivered. So I phoned UPS Rhonert Park. Speaking to Amanda whom completely unprofessional throws John under the buss by stating him to be ""Borderline Delusional"". Also stating that she had been out at the time of my delivery. Things at the stop had gone very wrong with alot of complaints for costomers. Well I am out $500.oo for the dress plus shipping and packaging cost.$560.oo that the shop will not reimburse me. I am totally left feeling that this shop helped the scamer make good. I had done everything I could to stop that from happening. The store let me down."
"I have never left a review before in my life but I am so flabbergasted at the experience I have had with UPS that I decided to finally break my streak and warn others how awful this company is. If I could give 0 stars, I would. I have had an issue getting a package delivered that requires a signature (for some reason). The package has been sent back to shipper and re-sent back to me numerous times because they can't ""get ahold of me"" to get my signature. They have never even tried! Customer service was absolutely useless. Not only were they not helpful in the least bit to resolve this issue, but they were rude on top of it. I guess I am doomed to have this package repeatedly sent to me and then sent back to shipper unless I sit in the lobby of my building for the 4-hour delivery window and wait to catch the driver in person. Lastly, their website is horrible. Not user-friendly or intuitive at all and doesn't actually provide any usable or helpful information. Will never use UPS again if I have to, and honestly want to stop buying from online stores that use them because I never seem to get my packages!!!"
"I absolutely hate when I do online shopping and it comes through UPS. I have a very important package on the way and it has been stuck at UPS for 4 days, I don’t have any information about it, even when I use the tracking number. UPS is the absolute worst. I tried to call 6 times already, and it just WONT get to to speak with a real person, just the automatic response. THE WORST COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"UPS=S**t.

As many points as UK/Netherlands/Spain/Germany got altogether in the Eurovision 2021 televote.

Reading other people's experiences being as bad as mine makes me somehow happy.

Edit: Sometimes I see UPS cars driving around in my neighborhood looking all fancy and I really do wonder who are the lucky ones that they actually deliver the packages to...? Or they just drive around to ppls homes, do nothing, leave with the parcel & on their way send message ""package couldn't be delivered""...?

Please, I beg you, never use this company for anything."
"Once again I’ve waited at home for a delivery, which was not made. Received a notification that the delivery driver had attempted to deliver the package. It is a complete lie! He was NOT here!

Tried calling customer service but could not speak to a local rep that could help me in my own language.

I hate, hate, hate UPS"
"We booked a shipment using UPS for Small Businesses which offered a fixed price for shipment of up to 70kg. But when we printed the label for shipping, it displayed 15kg (not the 45kg that our parcel weighs) and it seems that if we had continued with the Small Business option we would have been landed a huge surcharge on our delivery. BEWARE OF THIS SO-CALLED SERVICE."
If I could leave a 0 I would. The delivery driver made no attempt to leave my parcel with a neighbour even though my neighbours were in and instead have just taken it to a delivery point in the middle of town which is totally inconvenient if I'd wanted to pay for parking and walk into town I bought my item from the town in the first place. I have tried to contact them to arrange redelivery to my home address but this seems impossible to do altogether this is the worst delivery company I've ever dealt with
"1 star is too generous. This company has opened my eyes to just how dire they are.
The website is unworkable, with inadequate and wrong information. The call centre, is a stress inducing, painful, unpleasant experience. ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY MYf****** INVOICE.
I wouldnt recommend this business to my worst enemy.
Makes royal mail look good."
"i did not receive my packages
3 days on hold i did all paper they ask about it and i called many times customer services is so bad
not helping and always put me on hold for long time"
"I have been waiting for a delivery for 2 weeks now. There were 3 packages, I received 2 but one is still not delivered. It requires a signature but was not even attempted to deliver with the others. I called to reroute it for a special delivery on a Saturday so I would be there. I paid extra for it and they never delivered it. Now it says delivery on Monday. Again, I won’t be there to sign for it. You call and talk to them and they act like they will take care of it but never do. They are really worthless! It’s not worth it to order anything online if it’s going to be delivered by UpS."
This is a 55 plus building there are a lot of people that cannot get out of their apartments and yet some of your drivers are so lazy they continue to drop the packages wherever they feel like it in the lobby in the mailroom actually go to the different floors and leave them right outside the elevator anybody where anyone can pick up those packages and steal them and as far as your company is concerned they were delivered because that's what your driver tells you!! this has happened to me several times I have taken pictures if it does not stop I'm gonna turn you over to every company that I can including sending this to a lawyer we have a lot of people in this building that rely on their packages coming up there a driver came in today and I told him he can't just leave him on the floor in the lobby he said they're not allowed to deliver to apartments anymore and you just raised the rates we shall see about this..Some folks get their medications delivered and they leave these laying arou d instead to the appropriate apts. MEDICATION!!! We'll be contacting everybody I know including your corporate office An album public if necessary with all the thieves and going on this is how you deliver our packages shame on you.
I order a new computer was supposed to be deliver 3 days ago. I LIVE in an apartment so ups never try to deliver... they park for 3 minutes I get a text saying delivery was attempted and my computer goes back to the warehouse... now I have the weekend with no computer thanks to this cheap ups service 😑
"Worst customer service I’ve EVER experienced, time and time again. Packages delivered to an address that doesn’t exist to never be found again. Packages NOT delivered in the manner that was paid for. Their system is set up to frustrate with no humans available. USPS and FedEx are great, please use them and boycott UPS!!!"
They should not offer 2 day shipping if there is going to be a snow storm or adverse weather conditions. They are unhelpful and do not keep their word.
"GARBAGE
UPS is so trash!! Express shipping, like where’s my package so I can go pick it up tf!!!! Just saying NEVER USE UPS!!! I love everyone for who they are, but this is the first time I’m soooo over miscommunication!!! Fohhhh never again will I use UPS!!!! Paid $8 to pick up near my house but someone I guess it was already dropped off at an access point! Which isn’t even allowed with an Apple product like what the actual HELL then I asked for a refund , and she said I couldn’t get one. Finally I got someone who actually could help me! But still didn’t get my package when I truly needed it with express shipping. I would give 0 zeros"
"UPS started business in India and they are the worst.
They even don't have any proper way of tracking the package.
The delivery date keep on changing everyday and now it is showing ""The delivery date will be provided as soon as possible""

Real scam"
"UPS delivered it to one of their drop off points, but didn't make it clear that they were going to do this, or which one or where it is. The Parcel Progress table for this item completely contradicts itself by saying firstly that “This package is being held for a future delivery date”, and then 4 minutes later that it has been delivered. They are basically incompetent. Maybe that is why UPS have a ONE STAR rating from over 21,000 people on trustpilot. This score is far far worse than for any other courier."
The worst. They lie and tell u it will be delivered and it won't. Nobody has the correct informationThey just tell u anything to get u off the phone. Waisted time!!
"I got burned, you don't get burned guys…
I sent the suitcase and paid for the next day delivery , It's been two weeks, I call, I send an email, I ask where my suitcase is, and they say we lost it. Where does the big suitcase go?
There is a thief working at UPS, they are stealing your belongings! customer service is not doing their job properly, no call, no message, no gmail! no one takes care of you properly… If you don't want your item to be lost or stolen, do not send with UPS !!! I cannot tell you how sad and angry I am.…."
"Tracking says package was delivered to my front porch. No package present. Try to call customer service, automated system is a complete joke and hung up on me multiple times. Seriously, how hard is it to read an address and deliver a package where it is supposed to go?"
Like many I am appalled at the way this company takes your money on a 2-4 business day delivery and 10 days later I'm still waiting for the delivery to take place and when you speak to their customer service well I thought my package had arrived in its country of destination but stuck in customs. Wrong its not even left the UK !! I will never use this company again.
"Apparently it costs $120 to receive packages from US to Canada. Money grab. When I called to ask why that amount is so extreme, I was told because they had to do the paperwork at the border for me. UPS is a joke. Worst shipping company out there"
I ordered some work shoes from Amazon. The day it was out for delivery I got a notification saying change in delivery address. I did not request a address change so customer service was giving me the runaround then wanted to charge me to change my address when my address was correct. They sent my order to the ups store for pick up when I did not request that. I spoke to 5 employee and they all lied and said that it was getting delivered to my home. I hate ups!!!
UPS is the worst delivery service ever 🤬. I've been chasing my package for 3 Days and still haven't received it. The App is very difficult to navigate. Customer service is unaware of delivery process and can't tell me where the delivery truck is located so I can get my package. She even had the nerve to tell me her App isn't working either. I highly recommend USPS or Amazon for your delivery service because I never had a problem with any delivery and I get deliveries multiple times per day.
"Impossible to speak to a person on the phone helpline. Keep getting sent back to UPS website then robot just hangs up.

Email feedback is useless. Actual questions as to what / where not answered.

First parcel not been picked up from sender after four days, but I CANNOT find out why.

Charged an extra £2.40 to my PayPal - cannot find out why?

Difficult to set up and account to begin with.

Big company with big issues on the starting block!!!"
"Terrible service both times.
The first time they said there was an issue with the address and then sat outside my house but never delivered.
The second time they delivered it to a different address. Both times the address was correct? Would not use them again"
"UPS Singapore and USA are lousy in services.
I have never seen such a lousy logistic company. They have not trained their staffs well, which I do not understand why. They should learn from DHL."
"We spent $2200 shipping several suitcases from Pennsylvania to Breckenridge Colorado, UPS destroyed 4 suitcases and they will do nothing about it"
"The worst experience ever!
Tried sending a box of chocolates and a book to my brother in Italy as I couldn't travel to see him for Christmas due to the restrictions. Sent the package on the 13th of December and it never arrived. After 2 months of trying to speak to UPS and exchanging emails they are returning my package to me and making me pay a hefty fee for the privilege!
Please find another company and don't support these incompetent charlatans."
"I purchased a very hard to find car part from the US and had full insurance for the purchase price of the part. The item sat in transit for almost 2 months and UPS could not give me a solid answer of where the part was. After two months of nagging and saying that the part was in customs awaiting further clearance, we finally found out that the part had been missing since the very get-go and UPS declined to ever inform us about this. When we received the refund for our claim, the amount was far less than the insured value and they refused to pay out anymore. The representatives were very unprofessional. When I finally managed to track down a new part, unfortunately it was from a rural area and UPS was the only provider that the seller would ship by so we had to go through them again. I paid $300 to have one day shipping from USA to Canada which ended up taking almost 5 days to arrive. UPS has declined to refund us for the one day service and we still have not received the part however we have been guaranteed delivery date of tomorrow. I would highly recommend staying away from UPS at all costs and going with FedEx or DHL."
"I know Delivery Companies are struggling with demand, but the Customer Service at UPS is definitely one of the worst out there. It feels like people on the phone are completely drained, to the point I feel like maybe speaking to a robot would be a bit better because they wouldn't be rude. My honest feedback is that you should at investing more in your Customer Service practice, as this is the face of your company. Please feel free to reach out to me for more detail as I like to be constructive and helpful so you can get better."
Well today has been a eye opener i run a small business shipping about 150 parcels a week about 50 of them are with UPS so you are going to get the odd parcel damage or go missing from time to time that's life!!! so at this moment in time i have 3 parcels that have gone missing i put 3 claims in and all 3 have been approved!! by UPS admitting that they have lost all 3 of them as of november last year GREAT!! but getting paid back for these claims is near on Impossible you call them and every time you get a different answer the last caller told me i would have to wait 20 weeks before a claim can be paid that was the last straw they just hope you go away but not me sorry UPS all 3 claims only come to about £55 in value but to a small business it can mount up so now its the small claim court route I've got all the evidence and the proof needed so my message is don't give up if you have to go to court it costs £35 you can claim for your time and effort and interest as well they just hope you will give up
I was informed that the package was delivered at the door. no one rang the doorbell! I'm at home all the time for health reasons! the fact that my husband took the car from the driveway does not mean that no one is at home! why is there no photo where the package was left? ???? I can't even apply for a complaint on the site!
"If it was possible to screw up more things than what UPS does, there would be a special Olympics for it. And they would win hands down. To be avoided at all costs."
3 days delay so far for 1 day delivery. guess how much I paid for it. do a favor to the community and stop doing this business. what a joke
"I paid 60€ to send à urgent letter from France to Singapore. On the website, estimated time of delivery was 5 days. Sent on the 7 Feb, now the letter won't be delivered before 22 Feb. What kind of service is UPS proposing? Slow mail? Never use UPS again."
Delayed by 3 weeks. Is that enough to say?
If could give less I would. I get home to find out that my pack was not delivered as stated. So I do this track my package chat that is a computer and is a joke. I as to speak to a human and an offered a call back. The person that calls back tells me he will have dispatch call me back a have the drive go to where it was dropped and bring it to me? The dispatch calls me back very short with me start with well did you find your package yet. To which I replied or I would have called In the 1st place. So he tells me he will try and contact the driver and see if he will have time in the future to come back and show me where he left the package. 1st the were 4 adults at my home at hour it was delivered. Also I have a couple of dogs. No door bell was rung and no dogs barking. When then asked to speak to a supervisor I was told there none in his building. To which responded get off your bottom and tell them you have an irate customer on the phone and he tells me please hold. After a time the ring and just keeps ringing I waited a few minutes to see if someone would answer and no one ever answered. Great company? I would recommend not using this company ever. Very poor customer service
UPS has the worst customer services. They will lie to you just to get you off the phone. You have to call multiple times just to get to the bottom of what is going on. I have been waiting on a package that should had been here 2 days ago. The customer service rep wouldn’t release the line so that I can leave a survey because she knew that it was not gonna be good.
"It used to be a decent company... Not anymore!

Deceptive advertising (low cost, quick delivery, none of which is true). Couldn't deliver an expedited envelope for two weeks. Lied about the reason for the delay more than once."
I'd give zero stars if it were possible. UPS are trying to charge me €80 'brokerage fees' for sending a gift to family in Italy that's worth less than £50. They won't tell me what the 'brokerage fees' are for. It's not import tax / import duty / VAT because they are listed separately. Can someone at UPS tell me WHAT THE BROKERAGE FEES are for
"Awful, Awful Awful. A rotten company made up of crooks and liars. I changed my delivery address. I waited in all day for the delivery at new address but of course they try to deliver at old address. I call helpline and get "" O we're so sorry "" "" I'll fix that for you "" . Next day same BS. They try and deliver to old address, that is if they even do try as no "" we called slip "" is left. You call back "" HELPLINE "" even though they are no help at all, "" O we're so sorry "" blah, blah, blah the same crap and drivel. "" Let me fix this "" . Avoid UPS at all cost if you can. They are patently garbage, they lie, they do not give a damn at all."
I absolutely hate UPS. They do not deliver to my address so I always have to pick up from a location. They never give you an update about your package when it’s at a location so your package ends up getting sent back to the sender. I accidentally put the wrong address for delivery and they tried to charge me eight dollars to get it shipped to a facility even though I was going to have to pick up at a facility for free because they don’t deliver at my address. If any of my deliveries are delivered through UPS I immediately refuse to order any items. I only order through Amazon who is amazing!!!!!!!
Items come asap and wonderfully packaged <3
"From the very beginning there was a problem with picking up the package. Ultimately, the package was lost. The courier could not give the reason for her disappearance. I do not recommend the UPS courier company!"
"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL ,the drivers do not even try to deliver, missed another delivery and i was in the house, happens every time with ups and the customer service is even worse, very unprofessional !!!!!!!"
If I could give no stars I would. UPS are ok when things go right. When they go wrong they are the WORST company ever. Their customer service is a misnomer as it really isn't service and when you do finally get a claim agreed they delay the payment for as long as they can and then can't even pay the right amount. DO NOT USE
Delivered me a parcel from rugvista.Was kept informed by email of the details of the parcel and the tracking details and it arrived within the four hour slot allocated
"They don't try to deliver packages. I was sitting at home all day waiting for my package. They never knocked my door and just left a notice and then lied that they tried to deliver it. One time, they didn't even leave a notice so my packages was sent back because I wasn't notified."
"Business owners (large and small) stay away! Ups is filled with crooks and liars. We’ve used ups to ship our packages for the last 5 years. Stops today. Have had many missteps using ups but still considered them every time. I’ve been going back and forth for a few days about a customers package not arriving like it should have on Friday. As of Monday they tried and the store they were delivering to was “closed”(weren’t actually closed for another 3 hours). Today I call and they all of sudden need a suite number (I guess the fat logo on the storefront isn’t big enough for them). Upon giving me the suite number they tell me it’s going to be another 2 business day’s making it just about a week for 1 day shipping. I then ask for a manager (shana :employee code ext.6Q7734) who tells me her apologies, it’s on the truck for re-delivery . She then calls me back to tell me they actually can’t do tomorrow ( which means she lied about it being on the truck). I then try to call the billing department for a refund as my one day package is taking a week. Billing manager tells me our package is actually lost and an investigation has been started since Monday. So the 3 individuals who I spoke with ( manager included) lied to me telling me it was at a facility this whole time. Billing department says we don’t get our money back for shipping nor package reimbursement until there investigation ends( mind you they are the ones that stole it!) we will be withdrawing our ups shares immediately and opening an international investigation of our own with legal help. For anyone whose package has been “lost” I advise to do the same. It wasn’t lost in a matter of hours, someone within stole and pocketed our merchandise, and ups wants to help cover it up."

I didn't create this website but it's a clear sign of how pervasive UPS' bad reputation is. I'm sorry but I can't do anything but add to this negative reputation.

I had a parcel that was being handled by UPS; I received an email telling me the parcel would arrive today as per the initial estimate.
Well it didn't, I wasted a day off from work just to wait for a driver that never came to deliver my parcel.

The driver *never* came here. I received a notification at 10:05 saying the parcel was going to arrive. I went to check the tracking page and it was marked as ""attempted delivery"" precisely at the same time, 10:05. This makes me think the delivery person simply decided not to deliver my parcel.

They didn't leave any ticket whatsoever (I went to check immediately after getting the notification and there wasn't anything around).
This means I can't leave any additional instructions or ask UPS to leave the parcel to a neighbor because I don't have the barcode that was on the ticket that nobody left there.

Now I can only wait for the next day and nothing else - this is assuming the delivery person will actually attempt a delivery instead of skipping it entirely again.

A message to the managers/direction: please fix this. Increase the delivery estimate by 1 or 2 days, we don't care.

This is what makes people angry and bad customer service: not keeping your promises.

I believe most people, like me, won't bother waiting for an extra day or two (or even more). The problem here is that you're saying one thing but doing something different.
If you don't want to increase the delivery time instead of letting people down you could at the very least provide a range of days instead of one specific day so we can arrange accordingly.

Sometimes we *need* to know this, or it can disrupt our schedules and create other problems outside of just the delivery that consequently people discharge on you through bad reviews.

I get a feeling (also by reading the other reviews) that your employees/drivers don't care enough about delivering parcels. Please do something about it. You are losing customers, and the ones that aren't lost are getting increasingly frustrated.

Sincerely, I hope someone important enough and that actually cares reads this at UPS.

Thanks"
"I scheduled a pick-up at my home for a amazon return. The email I received said someone needed to be home (adult) which I was. it stated that the UPS driver would pick it up and if I was not reachable would leave the label. The guy just left my house not to long ago and he made NO attempt to even retrieve the package. He just left the label in a envelope on my door handle. I tried to catch him to give it to him but he just drove off. I scheduled this pickup because I would not be able to bring it to a UPS store before the return cut off date. Now it looks like I still have to end up doing that or pay 7.00 for someone to ""Attempt"" to pick it up again. Not going to happen."
great company very fast delevery if i can give more than five star i will do. im omar from kurdistan iraq my best regards.
"UPS used to be reliable. No more. Packages seem to sit on their truck for days after they were supposed to be delivered last week. It’s Valentine’s Day 6:30 PM the valentine gift was supposed to arrive on Friday. It’s still not here and it probably will not come until after I’ve gone to bed, if at all. I don’t think it’s just Covid something else is going on and it’s very frustrating and disappointing."
The don’t even deserve a star at all. The drivers lie and say that they attempt to deliver a package and didn’t. They said that the business was closed when I’m clearly not closed it is a Monday. I’m open Monday thur Friday 7:30-5:30. UPS sucks. The package was a Valentine’s Day gift and they ruined it by lying.
"The good has not arrived yet as of today, a week after the estimated delivery date. No information has been given given from UPS, nor from Seller."
UPS has got to be the worst carrier service EVER! Packages never arrive timely there is always some type of delay with deliveries! Ive had the worst experience with this Company and no longer purchasing from retailers who use this crappy and unreliable service. They definitely get a 0 stars from me!
"If I could give no stars I will do it...
It took 14 days on the next day delivery...
You couldn't talk to anybody, their website sucks..
The envelope was coming from Coconut Creek Florida to Miami Florida, if you drive it takes 40 minutes.. It took UPS 14 days...
I will never use it, and I told the company using UPS to use any other company but UPS....."
"Sent my package to wrong address. Had flowers supposed to be delievered on valentines day. Sent to wrong place during sorting. ""So sorry this happened but it will be delievered the following day"" Great company here. No reason they have 1 star."
"Terrible service! Parcel marked as abandoned while we spent a month trying to get it back to UK from Italy.
Zero attempt to delivery the parcel to Italy.
The receiver was contacted by a random mobile number asking for custom fees which were 60% of the value of the parcel,
So we contacted UPS UK and the guy at the phone said to do not pay anyone cos it was a fraud.
Next thing, we realized after investigating, phone call on top of phone calls, that the number was from a UPS broker asking the receiver to pay the import fees (Christmas presents) long story short they marked the parcel as refused by the receiver.
Hang on a second refused by who?
The parcel somehow ended up on the receiver city, at a local deposit so I have a photo of the parcel in Italy!
the receiver could see the parcel but couldn’t collect it due to a returning label already created by UPS!
We checked immediately the tracking number/returning label and we realized was not going to UK but for NL so we contact UPS UK asking why the parcel was going to a different address, we contacted them 5days in a row!
The answer was don’t worry is a problem in the system the parcel will be with you!
Today we have had a confirmation that the parcel is on a UPS abandoned deposit warehouse in NL and we cannot get it back.
Don’t use this company and most important don’t send parcel to Europe from UK!
Scammers!!

Update:
UPS Said Parcel2Go should claim the parcel from them.
PARCEL2GO said UPS as lost the parcel and it is untraceable and a insurance claim is open.
The tracking shows the parcel arriving to Milan and then mysteriously going to NL to the UPS abandoned Parcel deposit!
The reality is that the parcel was posted else where instead of sending it back to UK on purpose so we could not have it back after we tried every day for over a month to retrieve it!
We opened a claim, hopefully the insurance of the parcel will pay us back but it won't even be close to the real value of the parcel, some of the item where sentimental!
Personally if I have to be honest I think they will find a new excuse to don't give us a penny!
We will see how this will end!
Thanks to UPS for the great service!"
"It doesn't even deserve a star. I sent a package from the United Kingdom to Spain 2 weeks ago, it has not been delivered yet, and although I paid all the taxes, the recipient received an email in which he has to pay an extra 253 euros. UPS IS A SCAM"
"What a rip-off and lack of customer service. I paid 71 Euros to send a couple of pages across the Atlantic because the documents had to reach the recipient urgently only to find out that it took UPS 14 days to deliver these documents. I had to resend a new set of documents via a competitor that finally delivered the documents in only three days as promised.
Never again. Dont use UPS. It is much better, cheaper and faster to use the regular postal service."
"With such a low review score you have to wonder whether UPS care what their clients think. From my experience obviously not!
Sent package to USA on 24th January, arrived in Germany, Cologne on 25th, since then no further movement.
UPS shows on their alert page that the package is held up due to US restrictions in plane traffic, strange that none of the other couriers are experiencing the same! I even called Cologne airport management to ask if they know of any such restriction and their freight control manager said he had no knowledge of this.
I have tried calling UPS in Germany, who's xenophobic automated answer service only allows German speakers to use, no English option, where, when i have managed to speak with someone I am told they will call back and never do, have sent emails (why do i need to register my details to send an email?) which state a reply will be sent within 1 or 2 days, none received.
Have called UPS in the USA who say it is all very strange and will look into the issue, but still no progress.
The only good point is that UPS say the package is not lost!!!
Nearly 3 weeks with no movement, no end in sight and no way to recover package and send via a more professional courier."
"I tried to contact them by email, chat , and by their form.. never got any reply.. no package either !! Horrible company! NEVER again!"
"Slow shipping. Ships my package to 30 mins away from me first, which is inland and nowhere near the airport or seaport, and THEN informs me customs cleared. 7 hours later, it is still not moving. Before this all happened, package was also already delayed once.

Either they are just updating info however they like and however they want, or UPS has a different view of how time works.

Also, my packages always get delayed by some unexpected events. These are just excuses UPS make up when they dont want to hire enough people and only care about their CEOs making more money."
Good communication. Arrived exactly when they said it would.
"Ekdum kharab service h, sbse worst service, mjhse faltu ka 2000 liya gya.
Sabhi se bolna chahti hu ye service use na kren.Isse bht acha FedEx aur DHL h.
Please UPS se door rahey."
"I ordered something from India to be delivered by UPS. UPS sent texts and emails advising of delivery status. It was to be delivered today. The UPS truck stopped and the driver brought the package to the door to VISIT us. He told us that there's a COD customs fee that must be paid via cashier's check made out to UPS. He said that maybe a UPS truck will return tomorrow (Saturday) or Monday to collect the cashier's check and deliver the package. I asked him why UPS didn't include this info in their texts/emails about the delivery so we would have been prepared with the check. He said he didn't know but for his 26 years of working with UPS, this is their process. I asked him if he accepts cash and he told me no, because that's what gets UPS drivers killed. I asked if I could give him a check and he said it had to be a cashier's check. I called UPS' International Deliveries phone number and spoke with someone who told me this is UPS' process. I told him that its a bad, fixable process. Just communicate with the customer so the customer has the check ready to avoid re-work and a bad customer experience. I feel like I was talking to a wall. I felt the same way talking with the driver. How stupid is it to bring the package out for a visit when communicating would have helped make it a one-time, successful delivery? Who in their company thinks that its a good idea to load the truck with a package that won't get delivered and send notifications that lack needed info?"
"UPS delivered my package you the wrong address and had a stranger sign for it. The package is a huge wooden crate that contains a $4000 computer. I filed a claim and they claim that it is now out for delivery, but I'm not sure because no one has the common courtesy to call me to let me know what was going on with my package. I have a very unique address, I have no idea how the driver delivered it to the wrong address. They left me one voicemail and claimed that it was the shippers fault. (it absolutely was not the shippers fault) I am now waiting on my package that is over a week late and they STILL haven't bothered to call me to apologize or let me know that they found it. They pretty much just said if it is delivered let us know."
"Worst company I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. Drivers lie about attempting to deliver the package when I've been home all day, drivers don't call even when customer service specifically promises that they will, baseless delayes ""because of weather"" on a perfect sunny day, etc.

SHAME ON UPS and anyone that works there"
"Tried to send vital medication using fast delivery on December 5, package is lost and can not be traced, still waiting for delivery after more than 2 months, APPALLING service, never again"
"If I could give this service a 0 I absolutely would . I was Left a slip on my door that I had missed a package that had to be signed for. They said they would be redelivering it between the same time the next day and again I would miss it because my entire house is working . So I made arrangements to pick it up which they charged me 7.99 to pick up a present I was sent because my husband and I are expecting a baby . I’m not sure why a customer has to pay to pick up their package but that is absolutely horrible customer service . Then I’m told I will receive a call in an hr to be able to pick it up never receive a call . Call back again , again they tell me oh you will receive a phone call in an hr the truck has to drop everything off . Totally understandable. Never receive a phone call call again this morning they tell me oh it’s ready . I asked For a refund for the horrible service and I was hung up on , because the representative didn’t like that I told her I was doing her job . They also forgot to disclose it takes 24hrs for this process to be approve . If I could never use UPS again I wouldn’t. By far the worst customer service ."
Several hundred dollars worth of prescriptions left on the side of the road under a sign reading DO NOT leave packages here.
"I’d give ups a 0 if that was an option. A terrible company ran by robots. I have had a message every day for the last 8 days saying my parcel will be delivered between 10.30am and 2.30pm, never arrived, delivery attempted apparently but not to my address as we were here waiting. Obviously trying to deliver to the wrong address. No one to complain to, and still no delivery......fuming.....edited on 25/2/2022, well guess what, parcel now lost 😡 £450 trainers just disappeared apparently, now I also have the hassle of trying to get a refund from stock x, 🤦‍♀️ An complete nightmare."
"UPS has shown complete incompetence and no regard for finding a package they delivered to the wrong address. I suggest if you have an important document, check or valuable item do not choose UPS! They don’t care."
This company is pure trash. I have an email chain of some of the dumbest responses I've ever seen. They never answered my simple question and kept giving the same generic response. I wish I could give them a no star review. Hopefully FedEx and DHL can put this shi**y company outta business.
"Downright horrible delivery service, Item I paid extra to be delivered by Monday came on Thursday although it has being in the sorting facility since Tuesday .When I called to inquire about it someone who don't even speak proper English gave me the same answer ""Your package will be delivered today or tomorrow"" over and over ."
"If I could give 0 stars I would.

Still waiting on package 2 days later since original delivery date.

Spoke to a representative on the phone and was told it was my fault that it was late because I wanted to pick it up in store instead of having a 350$ package sitting on my porch.

I took a day off work to sign for it and was told that I would have to take another.

Unprofessional."
"Outrageous service in Sweden.
Delivery of valuable goods that ""requires signature"" and that was requested to be left at UPS service point, was instead left in the mailbox on the street without any signature.

Other times when you do want home delivery, packages gets delivered to service points in completely wrong area which requires you to travel for half an hour back and forth. Also never with any notice in writing or SMS/e-mail.

Never use UPS if there's an alternative"
"If I could, I would give them zero, honestly.
They have been holding my package for ten days now. They didn't read any of the emails I sent with the required documentation until I called the support center. And whenever I called, they would require the same documents I had already sent. They would notice the documents during the call and then inform me that someone would call me later to notify me about arriving... Which, of course, never happened. I keep calling to learn I am lacking the documents I already sent."
"I think the employees at the DT Lax UPS Store do an amazing job!! Jeri Lyn, Sharon and Keturah do their absolute best to make sure their customers are taken care of the best way they can! Can’t satisfy them all but they sure do try!!"
"claim filed 12/10/21 for a package that was crushed in transit, the lamp inside in pieces. The box should not have been delivered as it was clear that the contents could not have survived. Claim filed with 12 photographs... no word on it... ever. Called again in February 22, they say it would be escalated for the next day... Nothing"
Worst delivery service ever. Supposedly delivered the package to me while I was literally out of the country. When I opened a claim it just disappeared after few days from my space on their website without any action from their part or refund. Worst service ever!!
"I couldn't leave 0 stars that's how bad they are...!!!

I bought a couple screenprints from the states never had problems before..

1st the delivery guy puts a slip through the door doesn't ring the bell and then see there's a cod charge for £40...
But I had already paid taxes on my item..

This is where the problems begin you are passed from pillar to post different departments and noone can give you an honest straight answer... its always abroad too.. noone wants to really do anything just excuses.. or I'll pass you to my collegue.. 2nd person oh I'll pass you to my colleagues.. (get the idea)
Also I'm in building trade not sat on a computer... wasting my time and money..
I had ONE person do their job and tried to help...
Then... billing department is closed...!!!
9AM TO 12PM....
WHAT...!!!!

I ended up going to my local depot Watford who I can't fault... 5* service.. tried their best but even they were going round in circles... between departments and who I purchased from... a week and a half they were in contact with me..

Whereas I was trapped in the middle and ended up getting robbed for 40 quid to get my package as received a letter from ups who were going to try and fleece me an EXTRA 40 on top for late payment.. although at the same time someone was trying to sort things out for me.. more money all for something I had already paid taxes on..

It's on the carton clear as day.. cost of item, shipping and GB vat/tax... only an idiot at customs couldn't see that...the whole setups a mess.. just trying to get extra money out of people..
This whole customs thing and circles with ups has rubbed me up the wrong way...!!!
Purposely made to be difficult so you give up or just pay... even when something is being investigated they send you threatening bribery letters
I hope never to deal with ups again..!!

Ps... I don't want the same crumby grovelling automated reply that gets sent to everyone who makes a complaint.. Nothing will change.. just get more excuses"
"The worst carrier. Never on time with anything. Always takes twice as long as they say it will when you book it. 'Expedited shipping' in one instance took 5 weeks to ship from Germany to USA - a major route with dozens of flights daily! Germany to Australia, minimum 2 weeks. In both cases they advertised 1 week. With other carriers expedited services deliver in 1 week. Customer service staff also totally unhelpful and dont now whats going on.Useless talking to them. Every time. Never using again."
"Don't bother using the service if you ever want your package on time and it doesn't matter if you pay for expedited service, forget it it won't be there. They'll tell you day after day is going to be delivered on whatever day whatever time it won't be there. Nor were they contact you in regards to your package even if they lost it. Just use Amazon for delivery. Amazon pays the postal service to deliver their stuff. And the craziest thing is that the postal service will send out Amazon stuff and don't even send their own stuff out. Amazon deliveries our priority even before the US postal service."
"Absolutely shocking.
Ordered a premium luxury item.
Called and specifically asked to deliver on Wednesday the 9th Feb.
spoken to customer 4 times on Monday instructing this on the Morning.
- I get home delivery attempted
I ring Tuesday morning as I am not home and repeated the same info.
- I get home second delivery attempted

I call Wednesday it will be arriving today as I instructed and as well as the app confirming this “rescheduled delivery”
- I get a call sorry we forgot to dispatch this today.

The day I SPECIFICALLY NEEDED.

Absolutely ridiculous, the more I read it the more pathetic it is.
what’s the point having an App for this absolute shoddy service.

Seriously, please use DHL - I have spent over £5000 and their courier service is second to none.

I still can’t believe the incompetence of the above."
This is the worst company you cannot talk to know one can not get any info I had delivery that said out for delivery waited all day never received package stay home all day waiting on package and never show up no updates on package cannot call because it’s all automated to where you cannot speak to any one the worse company what has happen to ups will never use them they are worthless!
"Customer service is a disservice! On numerous occasions I have contacted customer service regarding service issues. The only resolution I receive is an excuse and scripted apologies for the lack of service by delivery employees. The appears to be no accountability or consequences for their actions. Repetitive actions, lack of diligence, failure of management to acknowledge and address customer concerns and timeliness of delivery services. False reporting of actual delivery. ( indicating delivery has been made, actually delivering a day or two later. Inability to interact with personnel at location of the problem. Service is not commensurate with fees paid. It is baffling that a package can travel cross country in 1-2 days but can travel from a hub five miles from your home in a week while ups trucks are parked at Walmart grocers, eateries, home depot and lowes for hours. Does Brown now have a shopping service?"
"Package was delivered to the wrong house. People living there refused the package and UPS decided to send it backto seller the same night. Seller who apparently is a scammer on e bay after ignoring me for 21/2 weeks, i had to have e bay getting involved to get refund.
Case is still pending. A real $hit show. All that because UPS driver goes to the wrong house, in a rural easy to find house, or just decided to bring package back to their warehouse."
"I AM Beyond livid !! UPS had a super lazy lying , don’t wanna do their bleep bleep job driver today for my neighborhood !!! FYI : this review is also on Google . So I’m supposed to get a much anticipated packages today . It’s been delayed since it snowed last week which is totally understandable. So I’m excited today to get my packages finally . I’m watching the notices like a HAWK !! I’m a UPS my choice member and the packages was also on the ROUTE app as well letting me know their coming today . I sat in my front room and also had cancelled appointments for today so I wouldn’t miss my delivery. It was that serious to me . LOW AND BEHOLD , I get a notification on ups app saying DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, my package won’t be getting delivered. I was confused at first . Cause I’m like severe weather conditions??? Our streets are clear . So I was like what’s going on? I immediately call UPS and I’m like what gives . Why am I not getting my packages today. This lady told me that the driver said “it was unsafe to drive and he didn’t want to get stuck” . My right hand to GOD , that’s what I was told by customer service !Im posting pictures for you all to see the “SEVERE HAZARDOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS” , THE DRIVER LIED THROUGH HIS RAGGEDY MOUTH ABOUT !!
So I tell her that’s a lie unless the driver was going to park on the sidewalks. My streets are clear . Matter of fact I got my mail today and FEDEX was delivering packages in our neighborhood today also . So why couldn’t this particular driver do his JOB !! Because he LIED about the weather conditions of our street on Cherokee street in saint Louis, Missouri !!! I hope like hell corporate sees this post and knows one of their LAZY drivers lied through their teeth about it being too “HAZARDOUS DUE TO WEATHER “ , to deliver packages on my street today !!! I also found out drivers have the ability to put in severe hazardous weather conditions as a reason to not deliver instead of getting approval through management first !!! What kind of BLEEP is that !!! You want to know what makes this even more outrageous, a UPS truck drove down my street while I was on the phone with customer service . Some straight bull s*** !!! And now , BE SURE TO LOOK AT MY PICS FOR THIS POST , thank you , because you can clearly see the DRIVER PUT “ HAZARDOUS conditions due to weather “ in the FIRST NOTICE @ 1:19 pm !!! Then @ 4 something SOMEBODY re did it and added “ emergency situation & or severe weather “ !! That my fellow reviewers is called : trying to clean up your mess and save your a** . Thank goodness I was smart enough to screen shot the original message . Because , I KNOW for a fact they would have called me a liar to my face . I will NEVER forget this !!"
"Ordered a product I needed by monday on Friday. Watched the driver walk up to the locked door of our Secure building and walk away without using the call box located with an arms length. Tried to yell down to him from the balcony, at which I was ignored and watched him drive away. Picked up the product Tuesday after having to go buy the one I needed monday. This only one week after having to miss 2 half days of work, without pay to wait and for a Package requiring a signature that I could not get released. They waited until I'd already left work the first day to reschedule delivery the second day. The next day left work, got home anticipating delivery only for them to reschedule for that evening and then the driver just leaves it on the porch without a signature! Really? You just leave it on the perché? What if it would've been $1500 worth of silver, you just left for any of my neighbors walking by? When I ran after him and asked are you serious? He just told me they're not requiring signatures due to covid. When I call customer service, I have to put up with their annoying automated system that refuses to put you through to a live person until you're ready to choke someone and then they ask why I'm so upset. Ummm, because as a whole UPS is absolutely incompetent. I never ship with them and will start stating away from retailers that do. The color of their trucks reflect exactly what they are."
waited all day for a delivery that never came after them changing the delivery time 4 times and on the update telling me it was less than 10miles from my location to then tell me it would be delivered the next day and i thought hermes was bad not a patch on these guys
Literally THE worst delivery service in the world. Avoid at all costs. Don’t bother dealing with any company that uses them as a courier because you’ll either 1) never receive your item or 2) receive your item this time next year. Absolutely ridiculous. Customer service is super rude and lies to you as well. You’ll be told many different things each time that you call up.
"The worst customer service I’ve ever seen. My package had two day delivery but was delayed by a winter snow storm. Ok, I get it, not a problem. Three days later it leaves the impacted area to arrive at the service center 20 minutes from my house, where it has now been sitting for the past four days… Good luck getting a straight answer from any of the customer service representatives who all parrot the same excuse that weather is causing a delay and to keep checking my tracking number. It has been sunny and the roads have been clear for days! Yet still no update on when my package will actually be delivered."
Just one word rubbish. Would not entertain them again.
"This is the were most PS have a job. Ones that can't get a job anywhere else, they work here because there pericytes of the earth. And should not be allowed around any one's important packages or mail of any kind. Cause their illiterate and can't read, multiply, or drive, and don't take pride in anything they do. That is why people turn agency them and it not a good outcome most time. And they deserve it because they tear your stuff up steal it and don't get in trouble for it ever and they all do it!!! So, I can only wish bad things to happen to this company in the future. I curse it all to hell and the outcome well cleanse the earth"
"1) UPS does not call or give any info about delivery in advance. 2) if you happen to be at work or out of the house when they decide to deliver without notice, they send your package back instead of to a different pick-up 3) because of all this, l changed pick up place in advance so that ups could deliver to a store. Still, they have not tried this, but tried to deliver at home. No notificcation about this either. I called customers support, and talked to a very rude woman. I will from now on never order something from abroad if UPS is their provider, as I always have trouble with UPS but not with any other carriers. UPS is a disaster!"
"Ups customer service is a bunch of lies. I was on the phone with customer service everyday for the last 3 weeks and all I get told is we will get back to you in a day or two
All lies. They still have not contacted the receiver
Absolutely nothing has been done
Extremely unhappy
Will not use ups every again"
"If I could give UPS less than one star I would. I paid for a package to be delivered the next day. Not only was my package NOT delivered the next day, but it is now day 4 and still it has not been delivered. By NOT having my parcel delivered, I have lost hundreds of dollars I didn't have to lose. I have reached out by email over 10 times and still my package has not been delivered, nor have my emails been answered. I have asked for a refund over 5 time, and I have not been reimbursed, nor have my requests been acknowledged. UPS claims bad weather on their website, but I have watched the USPS drive by, FedEx drive by, but no UPS. For two days, their tracking site has said ""delivery by 10:30 am"". It's now 6:17 pm and still no package. Please don't waste your money. Use FedEx or USPS for your parcel deliveries. You'll have much better luck getting your packages where they need to go."
"'We are not able to reach due to the driver doesn't have access code'. There is no gate, no fences. They can litterally drive to the front door of my apartment. If UPS is so short-staffed that they make this fake failed-delivery attempts, they should just go out of business already."
I have tried several times to give my signature online and it keeps telling my account is locked even though I changed my password several times. I spent an entire hour trying to fix the problem and still no resolution .
"Store #6930 Waterloo IL. Great service. Quick, smart & clean operation. Great and helpful employee’s. I enjoy doing business with them, especially with Lori who was particularly helpful today.

"Literally just made an account here for nothing else than to let out steam on this company.
Absolutely useless is an understatement. A group of apes off the local Zoo would do a better job at moving boxes from one warehouse to another. This is the second time they completely lose a package.

First time I tried to send a friend a 15$ item. Oops got lost, literally didn't even tell me how or when, they just straight up did not know where it went. Also I was informed by Amazon, not these people, they were radio silent. It was too much of a hassle to deal with so I simply accepted I burned around 15$ over nothing and it was likely one of their employees simply yoink'd it.

Second time is partially my fault, in that I ordered the item so fast that I failed to realize it was these people that were delivering it. ""Screw it"" I thought, ""this time is to my house, it shouldn't be a big deal, maybe it's harder to deliver in small towns like the one my friend lives in.""

I check on my package and realize that it has a slight typo in the address, ""my mistake, nothing that can't be fixed by contacting UPS"" I assumed. I made my account for their site, do my thing, as soon as I put in the tracking code so I can change where it's heading... it no longer works... (?) It simply says
""We are unable to complete your tracking request at this time. Please try again later."" I slept and woke up, I've waited and I am still greeted with the same message... Why? I was able to see the progress of my package just fine without an account just a few minutes before I even made the UPS account!
Is the bloody package lost? At least last time I did get notified of that but that was Amazon, these dudes just leave you in the dark. All I wanted was to make a slight change in the delivery address so it'd arrive directly to my house and not the middle of the street.

At least I did manage to see what time it's supposed to arrive before they were no longer able to know where the bloody hell my package went.

I'm simply going to go there and wait for it to arrive. This item costed me 60$. It better arrive. I will not let this nonsense slide this time.

Dread. Dread is the only god damn thing you feel whenever you see it's these people handling your stuff."
Receive my package on my porch. UPS deliver did not ring my doorbell nor did they knock on my door. I track my package and it had been on my porch over an hour and a half. It was pouring down rain in my package got wet and I had to make sure that my computer that was delivered in the box was not destroyed. Both of the boxes was wet good thing the computer was not but the thing about it was at least they could have knocked or ring my doorbell cause I was at home. Don’t understand why they just didn’t do the correct job. It needs to be reported that UPS needs not to have no more delivers to deliver anything to anyone’s house that is bad business.
"I leave 1` star because I can't leave fewer. UPS has lost a package that I needed for a funeral. 2day ""air"" was actually 8 days by truck. This company is the absolute worst."
"Worst company everything, it takes twice as long as any other courier/shipping, eastern Canada it's fine or a city but rural BC totally useless ,when Canada Post finally gets the transfered package it probably sat in a warehouse for at least a week."
I live in a 6 story high-rise and UPS is too lazy to take the elevator to the second floor and deliver your package instead they would rather say it was undeliverable.
The absolute only reason you guys are even in business still is because there is no other choice. You guys suck you are the most useless carriers in our country hell in the world! You're lazy worthless dishonest and pretty much just a waste of oxygen. Get bent people.
Terrible service. Lost my package 2 hours from my location it had an arrival scan but never a departure scan.
This is the 3rd time that I have paid to have express shipping and they lie and say they attempted to deliver when I am literally tracking the package every 10 min... They have the worst customer service no one can tell you anything you have to wait for a call back which never happens. Also they told me I would receive a call back and did not they constantly lie and have no answers thank goodness I didn't actually need my package on that day because once again this service always fails to deliver literally !!! DO NOT USE THEM IF YOU ARE A COMPANY SHIPPING PACKAGES THEY DO YOUR CUSTOMERS A HUGE DISSERVICE !!!
I am writing about the amazing customer service from Eric working at the Couerdalene store. Fawna is also exceptional. The two of them go above and beyond and im so thankful.
"Overall UPS service has been professional, courteous, and great anytime I've sent or receive packages up until today. So I would previously rated them four stars easily. But one DB millennial aged POS delivery guy delivered a package, not to the porch, but dumped it face down, in the snow in the front yard. Upside so you had to turn it over to see the ""this side up""&"" the please handle with care FRAGILE"" wording and stickers. What was inside was the bottom of a toilet in who knows how many pieces. He refused to even wheel it up to the porch steps and only said have a good day. That wimpy little fragile millennial princess of a guy is why I'm dropping my overall rating down to a four. I honestly don't think this weak pansy ass excuse of a man represents the vast majority (I'd say 99%) of the good drivers not afraid to break a sweat like this little pampered soyboy. He's just the one that gives the rest a bad name."
Way to go ups. I called tell you my address was missing the last number on the address after trying to correct the address with the sender. You were able to fix the problem and my package was delivered on time. Thank you ups.
"My UPS experience was
and is nothing but a big catastrophe… package delays ..is ridiculous I understand weather delays… and mechanical issues but UPS has too much money to have long Delays… to receive packages weeks later …"
"Consistently inconsistent. Whenever I get a notification that an item I purchased is being shipped UPS, it's almost guaranteed to arrive late. Their service is laughably bad. How does a ""next day air"" package take 6 days to arrive? How has a company, who has been in the logistics game for a hundred years, not been able to figure it out? I'm guessing some corporate cost-cutting initiatives have crippled UPS's ability to perform the basic task of delivering a package on-time. Do yourself a favor and use USPS or Fed-Ex, cheaper and more reliable."
"I feel as if I am worthless, that ups feels it can disrespect me. My package was to OVERNIGHT, that didn't happen, then, once it got to Brevard county, it gets sent to Miami. Its already back in transit, be here by 1pm, and then it sits til Monday, because UPS does not care about We the Paying People. Ne"
"Never again. Shipped a package in early November via UPS store and told I had $100 insurance on it. it never arrived for my granddaughter’s birthday a week later. Tried calling, waste of time their call center is in some foreign country. Got the runaround and told to return to UPS store. Same deal but would investigate and call me. No call. Returned and given a long list of must do’s for a claim. Complied and waited, no call. Forgot about it because of the holidays. Went back told to return in a week they were too busy. Went back again same story. I refused, stood there until I got the information. After a call and finding my paperwork told the claim was denied because the package was incorrectly packaged and gave me a number to call. Called, got a robo voice with no choice to talk with an agent. A woman who was at the desk at the same time told that happened to her too. No proof other than the receiving hub’s word. Being the holidays makes me suspicious."
Worst way to go when sending or receiving a package. I will never go through ups again I never get package on time it's always 2-3 days late and when I contact them I always get someone that doesn't know how to do their job and get told exact info I have on app. Worst customer service and delivery!! Do not use this company ever. If I could rate it negative 10 I would!
Worst company ever! I paid $110 dollars for overnight shipping for something very important. There was a small weather delay and the package sat at the hub the entire day. They then tell me since it's Friday and I didn't pay for Saturday delivery ( why would I when it was overnight on Thursday?) that when it arrives on Saturday they won't deliver AND they WONT let me pick it up. I already paid for overnight shipping so why would it come almost 3 days later with no ability to pick it up? I talked to 5 rude people who all were zero help. This is the fourth time I've had an issue with UPS. Never any issues with USPS or FedEx. Do not use this company. Zero stars if I could.
"Don't bother calling. The automated service hangs up on you, offers no concrete info. If you ask for representative, they want more info. When you give the info they refer to a website and hang up. I filed a claim a month ago and have no update, no response, and no way to talk with anyone. THIS IS THE WORST COMPANY. NO SERVICE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. I will not shop a company that uses UPS, and will make that known."
"Horrible people to deal with. Brought my delivery package damaged when im not home and for 8 days suppose to pick them up after 3pm but never showed up. When time i called all was said was ""sorry we'll send a truck out tomorrow after 3 pm"". Extremely aweful customer service."
"Trash company, customer support LITERALLY doesn’t exist I’ve waited hours for a human “ They never picked the phone up” and have had multiple packages arrive way later after not being updated at all during the delivery. What a joke"
"Promised delivery Friday 10.45-2.45 and required signature so we stayed in. 4pm tried to track - not available...

7pm e mail ""deiivery rescheduled"" for same time Monday. No apologies.no reason. No customer service.

Reminded me of govt.monopolies of years ago..."
The call center automation software SUCKS!!!! She doesn't understand my tracking number and hangs up!!! I have a delayed package and I can't find anything!!! I have been calling for two days now!!!
"This company is utterly appalling. I have now resorted to refusing to buy items if the supplier uses UPS. What makes things worse is that they lie about what’s happened - wrong address…no one was in…tried delivering but couldn’t. I am always in, I have multiple successful deliveries by other companies - it’s all very demoralising. Don’t ever use them!"
"Maybe the worst courier ever! I Have tried to contact their customer service by email, they never answered. UPS claims they tried to deliver my package but I wasn't home. Someone is always home and they don't even try to call! This is now the 9th time in a row this happens! This company is full of lies. Last time I had to reschedule the package delivery by phone four times (4 days in a row) until the driver came. I asked the reasons for this kind of behavior and substandard customer service, he just laughed and said ""I don't know"" and throw my packages into the snow. Normally they just leave my package at some random UPS access pick-up point (after ""no one was home"" lie), usually 2km-16km from my flat. This time my package is 3km away from here, and the nearest UPS access point is about 600m away from here and they never had left any package there. It's not that I am lazy, but that is a complete waste of my time and very poor customer service. 🤮🤢🤮"
"wrong adress , like i have seen many people complaing about here .
could not even change the adres becous the log in kept on failing so had to pay money to make a phone call .
in thiss phone call you waist multiple minutes pressing buttons and speaking in your order code (that the machine does not hear correctly for multiple times).
When you finaly get someone on the phone they don't even have your order code so you can say it again .

after all that they are not willing to admid there mistake and need 3extra days to bring a package 40km .

worst delivery service i can imagine ."
"The worst company. I waited at home for the courier and he never arrived. Instead I got information that the address is wrong. I have been livening at this address for the couple of years. And there is always a problem with UPS.
The worst delivery/ courier company.
Try to avoid them if you don’t want to have problems."
"Not worth using. Unreliable. Payed for home delivery, never delivered, just wrote false message that I wasn't home, even thou i was waiting all day. Never gonna usi it again ."
"the worst service ever
driver claim first delivery attempted but was lied, I live in a townhouse with no fencing are barriers, I call UPS customer services explained that I have a quiet house with doorbells and my dog barks whenever it rings, UPS has my cell phone number on file and on delivery slips, I made sure to keep a lookout, and my import fees were paid, the next day same info was posted, second attempted was made that was also a lied, customer service repeated the same bull they will dispatch driver no one shows up, third-day tracking said third delivery attempted, how can they LIED SOOO MUCH?!! OMG, the next day tracking said a final attempt was made, a dishonest business will always fail, big are small."
"UPS is without a doubt the worst parcel/carrier/delivery service I have ever had the misfortune of working with. Twice within a month they have failed to deliver a signature required item to the correct party, once without a signature at all. Both times they have told me that they are completely and wholly non-liable for the issue, and refuse to remedy the situation or take any corrective actions. The first directly put my identity in jeopardy, and the second directly jeopardized my offices ability to provide necessary healthcare to patients. The company is grossly negligent, almost willfully malicious, and refuses to take any responsibility for their misdeeds."
UPS has lied about leaving packages (camera proof) never delivered- 3 packages in one week stolen by driver as driver never showed up at my front door but wrote that he/she did on way bill…then having to go through customer service…what a joke…
I would like to thank ups for thier proficient professional services.
"Tried to get in contact regarding my parcel of which keeps getting pushed back on expected delivery, costing me and my business money. No way to actually speak to an actual person. Terrible service all around"
Hi I stay in Louisiana near the lake and I just wanted to give a big thank you to the truck drivers and the companies I order from. I have never been disappointed my stuff has always been early or on time and when it wasn’t it was a busy time and still there where cars that pulled up in my yard just to give me my package. I’m not sure what happened to the truck that day. But I’m very thankful and thank a lot of the one that drive these truck just to deliver someone order big or small. Thank you so much means a lot!❤️
"UPS tracking showed at 9am this morning my item was out for delivery. So I sat here waiting because its an electronics item and I didnt want it sitting outside in the snow. At 6pm the item still wasnt here so I checked the tracking again. And they changed it to they couldnt deliver it today because of bad weather. It snowed. Fed ex was out delivering, amazon delivered, usps delivered. Hell my 18 year old daughter who has had a license for a year drove in to work and back. Literally everybody did their job today, with the snow, except ups. Hey but thanks for screwing up my entire day waiting for a package you never even delivered."
"Everyone warned me about ups in my town. Fedex, 0 problems. USPS, 0 problems. My first time dealing with UPS in this town was an absolute nightmare. No actual rep to call in to, stopped at the customer center and it was closed during hours of operation. I paid for two day shipping and it will now be 3 days and I have to miss work to stay and sign for a package no one else requires a signature for. They also don’t let you know ahead of time you will need to sign. The signature is not required via who I ordered from."
"Always a problem.

Never ending story with UPS. I never recieve my packages, Ups driver says i'm not avalible witch is not the truth. Packages dissapear. When calling UPS they have 24 hour response time. And tells me now that the package is to be delivered within 5 days. (express shipment). I tell ups callcenter that this is not acceptable, the reaction is they hang up.... Nice customer service"
Give the drivers a phone! Missed package it make sense!
"UPS is the worst brand you will ever do business with,I never want to have anything to do with them again.I have always had issues with them,hardly experience a smooth delivery service with them
The worst of it just happened, their carrier stole my item (a brand new iPhone 13 promax),and I am so crazy right now.I am still on the case and I will make sure I see it through
I wonder why Apple still use their service"
"I would give 0 stars if possible.
They left my 5k computer at the wrong address!!!
When I can, he says they will go back to the wrong address to pick the computer up. What the hell??
And for 3 straight days, the deliveries were after 9pm, but it's a business delivery!! Nobody is at the office after 9pm, what is wrong with UPS these days ??"
"I had a dispute with them. I ordered a PC keyboard, and suddenly my Email says: ""Your package was just delivered"". I checked the doorbell, but it was not broken. So I looked if they dropped it around the house, but there was nothing. Then I complained with UPS, and after some time I get by email a copy of my own signature, saying I signed it. Though it was clearly recognisable as a digital scan of some kind. I objected, and said it's time to speak with the driver. I did NOT sign in the terminal. They said no, I have signed for receival. Period. So this is the dispute, they have no explanation for how my signature came into their terminal. Well the item was only 15 Euro value, but I took this as a warning. I checked better how the next delivery was done, and I could see, after signing, my signature does not dissappear from the scanner, so the driver can see it."
"Wait for packages at home, they won't even try a delivery, I am working from home you can't pull the card ""you were not at home in the middle of the day"". You then call support, and they say the driver ""will try a second delivery"" while of course I don't even have a leaflet of attempted delivery. Fifth time in a row, they are just pure trash."
This has been the worse experience ever they were supposed deliver my property over a month ago an they’ve done nothing but give me the run a round. An everytime I check the status of my property it constantly says onhold. This is complete nonsense.. I hope they go outta business soon. That’s what they deserve from all the rest of these reviews.. Sencerly a very unhappy customer… 😡🤬😡😡🤬💯💯💯
"I wish they would teach some of there driver not to block in cars. I was at trader Joes today... when I came out their UPS driver had blocked my car, I couldn't get out of my space, they need to learn courtesy.
There were other people around they couldn't believe it."
"Just don't!
DHL is more expensive but infinitely better!"
"I had a delivery scheduled and at the last moment during the driver's route ""Some how"" it got changed to a pickup and a notification that there was a problem with my order. I had to call several times just to find out what happened. They then lied and said the driver has already passed my house and took it to a ups center. I NEVER requested it to be changed. I can only hope I get it and it's in good condition. Totally frustrated about this"
"No customer service whatsoever...If you like talking to a machine, this is your company"
"It is a bad company.
I paid for an express shipping last Friday to be deliver today (Monday). I tracked the package and called the store and customer service. But my package was never sent.

Advice: never pay for extra fee so the delivery will be fast.

Plus, they are thief because they're never going to refund me."
"Ordered some expensive computer parts, and unfortunately it was delivered with UPS. I SPECIFICALLY ASKED AND PAID FOR SIGNATURE DELIVERY because there are package thieves that operate in my building. The order was two days late, and it randomly appeared in the lobby of my building one afternoon. There was no text/email notification telling me it arrived (even though I signed up to receive them) and the delivery driver DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT to get a signature from me, or even from a neighbour! They didn't even use the intercom to call my apartment in the first place! To add insult to injury, the box was left in front of a heater in the lobby which made the box very hot to touch, and could cause damage to the expensive parts inside. I will ALWAYS avoid using UPS if I have a choice."
"The driver has stated I wasn't home, was not able to deliver the pack and has delivered it to a service point 15 km away from me. And the interesting thing is I was at home the whole day waiting my package. Have checked security cameras to see when I have missed him and guess what? - he wasn't visited me at all.
Have spent 4 hours on the phone to get my pack delivered next day and you know what? - nobody is even sorry about this.
The worst customer care I have ever seen."
"I shipped a 3lb package to my elderly parents on January 24th, 2022. As of January 28th they still had not received their package. I looked up the tracking number and it showed it being picked up but nothing after that. I tried to call only to get the most annoying robot who never helped me. I finally went to tech support who told me it was lost and to file a claim. There were things in that box that cannot be replaced and I am heart broken."
"I arrived at the store at 336 36th Street, Bellingham WA 98225 on Sunday January 30th, 2022 which should be open until 4:00pm only to find a sign on the door that stated, ""Attention Due to the spread of COVID-19 we are experiencing staffing shortages. WE ARE CLOSED AT 3:00pm TODAY. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience."" Problem was it was only 1:19pm. There was not a soul in sight inside so clearly they were LONG GONE WAY before I arrived and hour and a half BEFORE they said they would be closing."
"Being at home, having not left at all, I received an email saying that my parcel has been delivered and signed by Rocío (I don't know any Rocío). I asked all the neighbours and nobody seemed to have signed or received anything. I contacted them and they promised me that in 24h customer service would get in touch with me. Two days later, I have not heard anything.

Estando en casa, sin haberme movido, recibo un correo diciendo que unos minutos antes, mi paquete se ha recibido y firmado por una tal Rocío (no sé quién es). Pregunto a todos los vecinos y nadie lo tiene ni ha firmado nada. Llamo a UPS, reclamo, y me dicen que en 24horas se ponen en contacto conmigo. Han pasado dos días y nadie se ha puesto en contacto conmigo y no hay rastro del paquete."
That’s why a lot of packages got lost evertime lazy ass driver doesn’t know how to read the address package’s get lost all the time
"How are ups still in business? All I want is to get my bed frame, but these baboons are the ones delivering it. I can't log on as they won't send a password reset, and the website won't let me create a new account for some reason. Even tho my estimation date was the 31st, it came two days sooner. Cool right? Wrong! I didn't hear the guy knock so he left with leaving the dumb ass ""sorry we missed you"" paper. I even tried calling to get answers. Now I dread calling someplace, so you know it's bad. Unfortunately, my attempt was fruitless. First, you have to go through dumb-ass robots who can't understand what you're saying. Then I was transferred to some lady, could barely hear, where she just asked for the tracking number. I said it twice, but apparently, it was not right, even tho it was. She told me to call back when I find the right one. What terrible service."
"0/5
Because ups Finland has disabled the possibility to review them on Facebook (go figure), I will review them on every other platform I can find. AVOID THIS COMPANY IF YOU CAN!

How can Ups Finland improve? Try delivering packages according to the timetable of your own tracking system! Since I know what happens if you are not at home whenever Ups decides to ring your doorbell (if they ever actually bother to do that), I have now stayed put for two days, while their tracking system has shifted from one status to the next. Oh, and customer service always promises that the package will be delivered that same day and that they will get back to you with a time slot within an hour... here's a surprising fact; they never do. My theory is that if you have paid for home delivery, chances are Ups will come up with a way (lying about tries to reach you at home, bad weather, operational challenges, too busy, alien invasion…) to make you pick your shipment up yourself in the end. It will just take much longer for you to get your package because then they will have to go through the motions before they are allowed to bring it to a pick-up point. So at the end of the day – Ups, most expensive, least trustworthy. Just avoid them if there is any way of doing so."
"Very bad experience!!!
5 days past, same info!!!
NO MORE UPS!!!"
"Worst shipping job ever!!! The driver and I'm quoting him here. ""Could not see my address from the sidewalk"". Therefore he couldn't deliver. If you can not find homes, maybe home delivery is not your best choice for a career."
"Worst experience store on Martin Luther King dr San Antonio I have ever experienced. The whole process stinks, if you have to never go to this location."
They are the worst on top they drivers lie about delivery they will leave at wrong house and say they delivered to u customer service the worst they don’t want to hear nothing if the driver say it was delivered to u they dont care if u say it want never ever using them
The worst place can ever have your package sent from ordelived with just received a package today completely mangled parts missing I can give them zeros all the way around I would
"UPS did not update their drivers that i had paid for the customs on my items a week ago and so my parcel was delayed TWICE now. Their tracking did not indicate an issue would occur in regards to any payment problems and led me to believe my parcels would be on their way (i even had a time slot each time)

When i asked them why they cant deliver the next day after getting them to fix their updated payments, they said they dont deliver on weekends. I know thats a lie because they offer special weekend deliveries for people who pay EXTRA

So they have charged me customs, delayed my parcels TWICE, didnt update my payment information when i paid so far in advance, and they have said, and i quote and recorded it, they will ""not be offering compensation"" for their mistake in anyway at all

Fantastic service, NOT!!!!"
"I don't know which is worse UPS or FEDEX. THEY both have a bunch of DUMB A*** working for them. If they are competing for stupidity then UPS wins hands down. I've never seen a bunch of unprofessional before that work in one place. From the drivers, customer service, reps. The stupid UPS App is a joke. They say your package has been delivered, but of course it hasn't especially when your at the location waiting to sign for a package.
Don't even waste your time, breathe, or energy calling customer service because you would be better off trying to cross 5 lines of rush hour traffic!!!!"
"I requested a pickup for a defective Amazon package. Without knocking today, a return slip was slipped through my mail slot and I ran as fast as I could to catch them. I screamed out my door for them to wait and they simply glanced at me, ignored me, and got back into the truck. Now, they are refusing another pickup attempt and say that I have to spend $18.50 for them to pick up my package. Unacceptable."
Very bad service. They did not come to pick up the package when they were supposed to come and instead of helping me they ignored me. On top of that they have charged me almost 200 euros saying that the package exceeded the maximum dimensions and that if I had photos with a ruler showing that it was not the case I could claim. I have complained and they haven't given me an answer for a month and have ignored me. They don't reply to calls and keep you waiting on the phone for over 30 mins until you give up.
"Pathetic is even a respectful word for this service, even they do not deserve this word as i am avoiding what they actually deserve. they are liars ,cheaters and disgraceful professionals...Had there been lower star rating for this service i would have given that rating to this service. I wonder how this service is managing to even exist in 21 century in Europe in general and specifically in Germany.....or maybe customers service is a word unknown to Germans..."
"If zero stars could be giving.

I am tired of UPS special here in Denmark, I do not know why it even exists when something goes wrong they blame their system and refuses to resolve the issue on whats best for the customer and the customer service is still useless.

If this package I was to receive today should have gone out to the northern sea hell would have been breaking lose if the shipment was delayed and the customer service do not respect the person on the line when the internal system have problems up.

Service do a better job or close down in Denmark...

I always have issue with UPS never with DHL, GLS even the Danish national post do a better job.

But I do not control what companies choose to use as a carrier sadly."
"Have had many deliveries from them over the years, mainly from Amazon. Lately, over the past many months, maybe years, their service has really seemed to be deteriorating. They don't even knock when they deliver stuff, they have been leaving packages at the doorstep in the middle of the night with no notice- i'd like to know if i have a package sitting out there at night- and to top it all off, today the ups truck arrives and knocks loudly at my door. I thought ""oh wow, theyve learned to knock. but i dont remember ordering anything..."" but it is a guy, asking me about a package that their gps says was misdelivered to my house on December 18, and asking me (almost demanding) if I ""still have this package"". um...i can't ""still"" have a package i never got! i wouldnt keep a package that wasnt mine- first of all- so maybe learn to knock and make sure you deliver to the right house and then dont blame random people for your distracted drivers!!!"
"Always late, or damaged products received, or both. The worst ever. You can't receive any tracking this is reliable or any real decent support. This is outrageous and disgusting shipping company, and I don't know how they stay in business."
UPS is the worst carrier! They always leave my package at the wrong address ALWAYS! I have to pay to pick up from ups store and PAY extra or else I'm not getting my package. When I call to complain they don't even care!
Should be zero !!! After getting in touch with the company and Mitzy ….still not resolved and no help whatsoever. My grandsons toys and clothes for Xmas and his birthday have still not got delivered. Eventually received message they were on their way . Not . UPS are obviously a bunch of thieves
"They really should allow people to give zero stars.
I'm waiting for materials to arrive, that wasn't ordered by me but by the company I'm freelancing for so I can get on with the making job I'm being paid to do. Waited in all day for it to arrive, no sign of it being delivered.
So I now can't do the job. I would rather be able to pop to a shop and buy what I need as it seems a more efficient and quick way than getting materials delivered. UPS is consistently bad but I don't blame the drivers. There the bottom rung of a poorly organised company."
"Package was delivered, but not to the correct address, very hard to get talking to someone to see there it was. Ended up it was in the neighbours house so got it eventually."
"Once again I have used UPS to send a box for my daughter and grandchildren in Denmark, the box was a few days later only because of covid at UPS Vejle Dk.The UPS service, delivery and tracking is excellent once again.

Regards Ken Patterson"
"Best transfer company in my opinion, no packages damaged and everything just in time thank you."
"I agree this company does not deserve even one star. I ordered from Amazon, the company decided my address undeliverable tracked it to a depot miles away to find it had been sent somewhere else to a Michaels also miles away. Tried to get it delivered to the building it was addressed to and was told NO it has been left at Michaels. If I know that a company will use UPS I will not buy from them again. Second time I have had issues with UPS. The first time thrown on ground in rain six inches from a protected step and contents ruined. How do they stay in business?"
"Didn't arrive in the time window on the day it should have ,then got email saying delivered, when hadn't, the got a email 23. 55, that evening saying coming next day !!!! Which it did ,so 2 days off work, need compensation, absolutely the worst, never again"
"My parcel from Amazon was supposed to have been delivered on the 19th of January 2022. Apparently, UPS is in partnership with Globeflight. The driver from Globeflight fabricated a story that he repeatedly phoned me several times and I did not pick up the phone. Now more and more lies are being told to me, including that the parcel has been returned to UPS because the delivery address is not clear. What kind of service is this? The service delivery from UPS and Globeflight is utterly appalling. They don't even deserve the one star. Amazon should stop using these incompetent companies."
These Mutha Effers don't even deserve a one star!!!!! They sent my packages back without attempting to deliver it!!!! They marked it as couldn't find the address.. YET!!!!!!!!! the driver put a sticker on the door!!! Make it make sense!!!! They are thee absolute worst!!!!!!! Never again!!! UPS sucks
"UPS sent my package back from Sweden to sender in Germany without ever informing me in spite of me be being registered for shipping updates. UPS will not tell me what happened so i'm not sure if they even bothered any delivery attempt at all. Now, i will most likely have to pay for new shipping out of my own pocket but rest assured i will not select UPS as carrier this time

Based on my experiences with UPS Sweden, it appears highly likely to me that UPS is a rotten company (or at least their Swedish branch) that deserves to go into bankcrupcy"
"Perfectly good service, UNTIL THERE ISN'T !

Absolutely terrible customer service, terrible communication !

When you do actually get to talk to a real person, they have no problem lying to you to get you off the phone every time.

From now on I will never use UPS, I will only use FEDEX"
UPS driver refuses to deliver my package for no reason. I am unable to contact anyone due to UPS customer service being automated and not allowing you to talk to anyone. I wish there was a way to avoid shipping with UPS I have nothing but problems with their services. I don’t understand what me paying for shipping is actually going to.
I was immediately greeted at the door when I walked in and ask if I needed help with anything. Erin Brown helped me today and I’ll continue to ship packages here.
"I would rate it -5 if would be possible! It's been about a year since they STOPPED DELIVERING to my address , which is PO BOX, ignoring PHYSICAL ADDRESS. FIRST, if you don't deliver, why you even accept packages? Second, I always include PHYSICAL ADDRESS, and they DON'T WANT TO DELIVER !!!! THIRD, they have phone number, instead saying: we cannot deliver, they could call and ask: HOW CAN WE DELIVER? But they just send packages back without any calls and notifications! This is being a year, since this started and so annoying and disturbing: I have to spend time and the stuff I accept don't arrive when I need it!!!! Ridiculous service!!!!"
"Terrible. Website is impossible, customer service is impossible. Delivered package that needed signature, I purposely had some one at my home, and I received a notification that no one was home. IMPOSSIBLE to make arrangements for pick up. USE regular mail."
I spent $31.05 to have a document sent 2 days. They sorted it wrong and now it will be 5 days before it is delivered. They refused to refund my money. So if they mess up they don’t take responsibility for it. That is discussing ! I will never use them again.
I have horrible experience with ups today I been on the phone for an hour and half. All I heard is the machine taking. You need life human to answer the phone. So we can get stuff done faster.
"UPS has been a horrible shipping company to work with. I have a current Worldwide Expedited shipping for $10.000 that has been stuck in Shenzhen for 11 days. When calling them you get the same answer every time ""We can't do anything, we recommend you to wait"". And for 4 days I have called and asked them to contact me and tell why this I happening and how we can solve it, but 5 days later not one single person has called me from this horrible company.

I can understand that we live in a pandemic, but they can still keep their customers up to date and try to give them an answer to why my $10.000 shipment doesn't move for almost 2 weeks when they sell a service that should take 3-5 days! If they had called me a week ago I could have switched to DHL or FedEx and had my products by now. NEVER AGAIN UPS, WORST SHIPPING COMPANY IN THE BUSINESS!!"
This is the worst UPS ever.. they never get packages on time. Or they be loosing my orders. I really hate when my packages get into there hands. They really need to be on there job
"The worst customer service ever. Complete lack of communication and continuity within the company. I have no idea how the are able to deliver anything. I purchased the service online, obviously providing my contact details and the necessary information for customs (you actually cannot purchase their service without providing it all). No idea what happened with the information I provided, but the parcel is being kept by customs for over a week now. Nobody contacted me that they want the customs invoice again. So I phoned them and asked what was wrong. They said - the customs invoice was missing. Absurd, but I sent it again along with the reference number they gave me in the telephone service. They replied with another email that they do not have the tracking number which the customs invoice relates to! Is it not supposed to be under the reference number from the customer service?! But I reply with the tracking number as there is no point arguing. After another few hours I get another email that they thank me for the tracking number and they need the customs invoice to progress! I wanted it to be a joke. But it was not. And I do not have to say that there is still no progres. I will never buy this service again!"
"UPDATE 2: As of 9 AM Wednesday (1-26) morning, still haven't heard from UPS on where my package is. I reached out to the sender, who told me, I can get a refund or replacement.

UPDATE 1: I have filed a claim that my package is lost, being that I haven't heard anything about it since I ordered it. They are saying I need to contact the sender about it.

I ordered books for school almost 2 weeks ago. The estimated delivery date was January 15-17th, 2022. Those dates have come and gone. I emailed them asking them what the delay was and when my package will arrive, no response yet. Their system said my package was scanned into the Oak Creek, WI, facility, then later that night it said that it departed the Indianapolis facility with no new updates since then. I need these books. NOT HAPPY UPS!"
"UPS has been nothing but horrible. They were scheduled to deliver my package, then hours after my scheduled delivery they notify me that my package was some how damaged (I believe it was on their end) and it has to be sent back to the sender. THEN I have another package which was super small, that they claim they attempted to deliver and failed to do so, even though I have a mailroom which is open 24/7 at my apartment complex. This is just simple laziness…"
"Had an issue with a tracking number of a parcel that led to the UPS website. When I emailed customer service, they blamed another shipping company, saying that *it’s not their fault* and they haven’t got a clue where my parcel is, since, and I quote: ‘The ultimate courier is not UPS,
but another courier has purchased a seat in UPS aircraft.’ Turns out, under ‘get more info’ one can view the actual tracking number and I was able to track my package through UPS. If only the UPS customer service were aware of that magical button on their own website :)"
I tried to register a account on site and the login page actually manages to loop when verifying my email on top of that the UI on the website is horrendous actually looks like my granddad with Parkinson’s tried to code this site on top of spending about 4 hours trying to fix it so I can track my package the driver proceeded to throw my 400$ package in the bushes next to my house causing it to shatter I will never use ups to receive a package ever again.
"I shipped a package and the driver said he did not need the commercial invoice I handed him. Then I was told the package was not being sent due to the fact that I didn't provide a commercial invoice. I requested a refund as the package was delivered late due to to this error on UPS part after I had paid for express delivery. it has been 2 months and they still are 'investigating', re starting the investigation, trying to argue why I should NOT get a refund etc etc etc."
"Here is another disappointing mishap by UPS. They just lost my package. Only when I start calling few days past delivery date they acknowledge loss of package. They claim they search for it, but could not find.
Also, good to know that it is written somewhere in contract that loss of shipment can happen and they cannot be responsible. Keep this in mind when using UPS
Only way to protect yourself is to put high value on the shipment, at least they will pay for the mishap."
"Shipped a package from Asheville, NC to Puerto Rico on Dec 2nd. It cost $260 to send. I spent nearly an hour in the store because the single employee was brand new and didn't know how to ship things outside of the contiguous United States.

Surprise! It never arrived at the address. There is a full time tenant who is housebound at the delivery address. She says no one ever attempted to deliver anything. No note, no notice, no email, no text from UPS or anything.

The package was returned from Puerto Rico to Asheville on Dec 23rd. I called and used the app multiple times to check on the status of my package and was told time and again that it was ""On its way.""

After a month and half of waiting I attempted to contact UPS to speak to a real person to get some real info on my package. IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET SOMEONE ON THE LINE. And after you've spent an hour with a chat bot, an hour looking for a phone number, and an hour on hold, you're informed that you'll have to wait for UPS to email you a claim form.

There is no way that anyone at UPS can say that I got anything that I paid for. Your customer service on the front and back end of this entire experience was entirely inexcusable.

You have not only stolen $260 of my hard earned dollars, you have stolen several hours of my time-- The trip to the store to drop off the package-- The multiple times that I checked on the package status by phone and app-- The hours (literally hours) i spent just today trying to find out what was going on with my property after I gave you several hundred dollars and entrusted that property to you."
"We have faced a large amount of complains with UPS until now . These complains having a root cause created at UPS or us. UPS lost papers which we sent to them. Parcel on hold for a very long time.

The main frustration is that UPS Germany and UPS The Netherlands is extremely poor in communication.

The hotline is telling us they will do something and do not come back later. They do not share any contact details for follow up.

No one is taking over responsibility at UPS.
Even creating a case is a black hole for communication.

Their system is not able to manage complains. Because everything is already late, UPS is adding 20-90 days on top.

Contacting the Key account is as well not providing any benefit.

Finally we got info on the hotline, that nobody is talking to each other and doing the job. So the anonymous status of the communications allow to do nothing.

If we got a direct contact for a location, this was always solving issues !

Think twice using UPS for now."
"When a very high value package was accidentally shipped to my previous address due to a clerical error, UPS was completely unhelpful. The seller, a third party via on online retailer, had restrictions placed on their UPS account due to previous issues with fraudulent buyers, and they were unable to change the shipment.

I dealt with UPS customer service on 4 different occasions over a 6 day period. Each interaction was worse than the last, with every subsequent customer service agent being less helpful and more rude than the previous agent.

I received a different story each time, with the only constant being ""we cannot change the delivery address"" despite my offers to verify my identity through any means necessary. I even signed up for ""UPS My Choice"" and paid the $20 fee to ""Change my Delivery Address"" only to find out that such an option was not available to me, despite one of the four customer service agents telling me that I would be able to do so.

The worst interaction was the last one, with ""Jackie"" who was impatient and unhelpful from the very first interaction. Her response to the item going to the wrong address and possibly being unrecoverable was ""Sorry, not our problem.""

After explaining once again that the item I was expecting was a high value item requiring my signature, and that it was very important that I receive it, ""Jackie"" told me that I would receive a call from the main delivery hub in my area, and that if I wanted to resolve the situation I would need to ""wait by my phone for the entire day.""

At that point I asked when I may expect the call as I was working and would be in several meetings through out the day, she told me ""figure it out"" and shut the chat down.

At no point was I ever rude or condescending toward ""Jackie"" but from the very first lines of chat, ""Jackie"" displayed a nasty attitude and clear hostility toward me. Needless to say, a call never came from UPS.

Thanks to the incompetence of the customer service team, the package was returned to the seller. The new residents of my previous address had thankfully refused the package, but rather than attempting to contact me or respond to my outreach, UPS simply opted to send the package back to the seller with a ""Package Refused"" reason. It ultimately took another 2 weeks due to UPS sending the package back via Ground, which took 6 days, and then a further week for the seller to repackage and ship the item back out.

This was a disgusting experience that should have been easily resolved. UPS Customer Service is atrocious."
"If I could leave a 0 Star review I would because the UPS drivers who comes out to my area of where I live they always go to the wrong address and I never can get any of my packages.
I wish everyone will stop sending my packages to me through UPS, UPS is trash."
They scam. Worste service in history
"If I could give zero stars, I would. UPS delivered an oven to my patio. The door on the oven was broken, and the box was falling apart. UPS would not pick up the oven because the box was falling apart, and it would be dangerous for their employee to move it."
"Ups has the worst customer service ever. I hope there was a lower rating, -5 stars. I was hung up on and called back and later told that they will contact me concerning the matter. No one contacted me regarding anything. Now we do not have our package the driver gave someone a whole Air fryer. The driver been working on this route for years, so that is strange. I really hate feeling defeated and I am drained and tired of companies that do not care about customers."
this is not a company but a mental hospital
"I had to provide a star otherwise I couldn't write a review, however I wish 0 stars was an option. I have scheduled my delivery pick ups weekly and NO delivery driver shows up at my location. What's the point of paying extra to have someone pick up your already labeled packages when they NEVER SHOW. Ridiculous, I will be switching to Fed Ex now, thanks."
The worst company to have your packages delivered. They have so many run arounds . Please if you shop don’t have this company deliver NOTHINH for you .
"I am not a difficult customer, but if a carrier can't place
a package at the right entrance of a house that's pretty sorry. I had 2 packages delivered last week that were either rained or snowed on, because the delivery driver was to lazy to bring them to our main door where there is a porch with the roof. Never had any problems with Fed Ex"
Pointless app. Not even close with delivery updates. Can’t rely on it.
"Moved to an apartment complex in W. Springfield an year ago. Our family has received tons of packages of since then. No issues with Amazon- they will ring the bell (if no one opens the door), or they will leave it outside the building... One time Amazon even called me about my package when we were not home! USPS- no problems either. *Twice now when vendors use USP, I have problems. I was home for both UPS deliveries- all day. And the UPS delivery person NEVER rang my door bell once! But on the tracking app. it states ""unable to deliver""or ""can't access building..."". How do you access an building if you don't ring the bell? Is like they don't even try. How come Amazon and USPS never have problems? Only USP?"
"I will never use UPS again. I dropped off a Covid test to be delivered to a lab so that we could have an exemption to go to Hawaii, and it was supposed to be delivered the next day. I have been tracking this package, and it is not on its way and won’t be delivered even by the day we have to leave. When I called them up, basically they just said I could be reimbursed for the next day delivery fees, when I could be out of a trip to Hawaii. This is a very incompetent company and I will never use them again."
"OMG! They said they put the package in front of my door and someone stole it! ok fine but why I pay for UPS service and not USPS because of that! If I pay is because I want to receive it in my hands or leave it with someone that can have it! then the driver call me questioning me like I was the one that stole it! are you kidding me ? The phone number that they got is useless you have to talk to an automated btch that never connect you with no one. No calls no updates nothing! Ah adding that took them 3 weeks to bring that package to USA from China because one of their planes was having problems. seriously you should consider closing the company. I never seen anything like this in my life. even the cheapest Chinese com[panies work better than U!

My tracking number so you can look up to this mess! im going to fill all the Internet about how bad is your service so people don't invest the money on your garbage company.

"Rats. I promised myself I would never use them again because in the past they don’t pickup at their drop boxes and never get the package there on time. But I did it Bc I wanted to send to
A ups store on my daughters campus. Sent store to store on a Wednesday for 2-day air delivery. $35. I figured sending store to store and giving it two days would ensure there wouldn’t be another disappointment. Well nothing was delivered. No updated delivery date shown. Just that there was a “sortation error” and package is being rerouted to correct address. it’s preposterous they can’t get anything right. Even the most basic store to store 2-day letter by air. Neve never never again will I use ups for anything I care about getting someplace in time or as expected. Oh and I love how they are unapologetic and won’t reimburse anything. In fact when I sent an important package that was not delivered in time they made me pay MORE to get my package back Bc recipient was no longer at delivery destination."
"Worst service ever. I had to pay an invoice for an imported goods and they made the procedure extremely hard. You can't pay online, you can't pay in-store, you are literally forced to pay over phone call. Still I don't know if the payment went through. Guys, this is basic business, and you are totally failing in customer service. I will openly dissuade anyone to deal with this company."
"I have sent package to my friend. Status showed "" package will be delivered on 19-jan"" and they asked me to pay ICOD (import delivery charges) I paid that too.. since 19 till date, status shows ""Import fees were paid for this parcel. come back tomorrow for updated delivery date"". I kept asking for reasons all I get to hear is "" it is beyond ups control"".. and now I got to know package is still at sender country ... They don't know when they can deliver.....

Unprofessional team, lousy customer service, pathetic apologetic replies, zero effort and dedication towards customer... I wish ups gets bankrupt for taking their customers for granted and not justifying with the work."
In the past two weeks I've had 3 packages dropped off at my door step that hasn't belonged to me or even my address..I can understand a mix up with the one cause it was the house across the street but when the address ain't even the same street I live is bull crap. I don't get paid to track down these people that you keep dropping their stuff off at my house.. So next time your driver leaves something on my door that doesn't belong to me I guess you guys can deal with the pissed off customer for not getting their packages.. Over lazy ass ups drivers use your dam GPS..
This is the worst courier company’s out there. I want to go and set there building on fire. My package is over 2000$ and they told me it would deliver by Thursday I called them multiple times they said there was an extra fee which I paid. The package did not deliver which I called for again and they said it would come in the next day. The next day I waited at my door for hours watching a ups van cross by my house then I called them again and it said delivery attempted becusse I didn’t pay the fees. Which I did. Then they told me they the package will deliver on Monday. Well c if that even happens. Horrible horrible horrible.
"My package was scheduled for delivery 1/21/22. The driver never arrived, never knocked on the door but at 9pm I get an email stating the package could not be delivered because a signature was required. That was a lie. As soon as I called customer service the representatives indicated the package did not require a signature. UPS should stop overloading their drivers and drives should be penalized when they falsify what they document as a delivery obstacle."
They delivered when they said they would and kept us very well informed along the wsy
"I AM SUEING UPS! IF ANYONE WANTS TO JOIN FORCES I AM OPEN TO TEAMING UP. IF UPS NEVER PAYS FOR RIPPING PEOPLE OFF THEY WILL NEVER STOP!!! I am beyond fuming mad with this company. This is the second time they have lost a package that is too large to lose. How on earth do you lose a 12lb bag of clothes, and how on earth do you lose a 20lb fireplace. I buy and sell online for a living, so I rely on packages being delivered to me and my buyers. Someone bought a fireplace from me and Fuc#!?ing UPS lost it, but in that situation I still got paid. This time I purchased a bundle of clothing that I got for a once in a lifetime deal, I was going to resell those clothes for almost 5 grand, but this incompetent, low life, good for nothing company, lost my $30 purchase, making lose huge profits. THEY MESSED WITH THE WRONG WOMAN!!! IM IN MEDIA MARKETING AND I WILL SPEND ALL OF MY EFFECTS MAKING THEM PAY!!!"
"I have been waited for a package from California to Canada, via ups for 28 days now and counting. It eventually made it's way to within an hour's drive from my address,10 days ago and counting now. It is just one excuse after another from numerous so called ""weather delays"", several medical emergencies, covid, and even a train derailment. Sometimes, I don't even get an excuse at all. I can not even get an estimated delivery date! This is beyond ridiculous already! I ordered a different package via Amazon from the same general location, that got here in 2 days with free shipping. Never again will I ever deal with ups. They are a complete joke and the worst courier that I have ever dealt with, by far! Never again!"
"The shipper MEGA packed my box. Marked all 4 sides Fragile with arrows pointing up. Never fails. Box arrived warped, broken pieces inside. Absolutely avoidable."
"Pay extra for next day delivery and the status shows ""Out For Delivery"" at 0910. Then at 1240 the same day, the status changes to ""Your Shipment Has Been Rescheduled For The Next Day"". This isn't 1st time I've been burned on paying extra to have a delivery for the next day and it not happen. How do they get away with flat out theft of money from paying consumers? Would've thought something like this would be illegal. Especially since they do not provide refunds. And just for the record this has happened numerous time, even before/we before the Covid-19 Pandemic."
"I have absolutely never been treated so horrible with a mail service. I was going to be away while a package shipped from the US to Canada, but my roommate was here to sign for it. They attempted deliver once (supposed to be 3 attemps), never tried to contact me, and then I get home to an email from the company I ordered saying ups is claiming I'm refusing to pay customs and that I was asking the small business tto pay the fees??? AND THIS WAS ALL AFTER I PAID THE CUSTOMS EARLIER THAT DAY. I am still shocked at the level of awful customer care."
"The UPS website is utterly appalling. Any attempt to specify a delivery date results in notification of a “technical error” - repeatedly. If you succeed in logging in to the My UPS section, you’re told that changing a delivery date can’t occur unless a delivery has been attempted. When drivers do attempt a delivery after you’ve pointlessly tried to rearrange a delivery, they leave the package by the front door. Emailing customer care is similarly hopeless, as they don’t even bother to read the email and regurgitate a scripted response."
What a pathetic excuse for a courier company! NEVER able to meet delivery obligations. Phone customer service reps respond with assumptions not facts & so you end up doing the same thing over each day waiting for a delivery that was never on schedule for delivery that day. They assume a delivery will be be attempted next day & so without checking facts. LIES & MISREPRESENTATION!! Despatch depot is just as useless but a tad more informative. UPS put in paperwork only so it shows the sender they are meeting delivery obligations when in actual fact the parcel is not at location or going through process but is elsewhere. So what you are in effect tracking with UPS is the paperwork & NOT THE PARCEL! Out of 10 deliveries UPS has failed abysmally in 9 where I needed to constantly chase up whereabouts of parcels with phone calls to both ups & sender. Their tracking is a dinosaur of all dinosaur logistics systems & is not real time. If they eventually deliver it is noted as wrong date in their system. They don't & won't provide notifications of intended delivery day & well because they can't quite frankly because they track paperwork & not actual parcels. Perhaps this rubbish service is acceptable in the US but it most definitely is not in Australia & most other countries that have decent consumer laws in place. I now have to refuse shopping anywhere that utilises UPS. The frustration & stress is not worth it. With so many courier options available the only reason a business would use UPS is it must be dirt cheap & it shows in pathetic service delivery & out of date logistic systems. They do tell you if you want to drive to their dispatch depot you can pick up parcel yourself!! I'm sorry but WTAF!!
"I was expecting a package monday, but we got a snow storm.
Instead of delivering the package later in the week (even if it's late) they are returning it to sender.
So instead of having the package late by 3 or 4 days, I will now have to wait for the sender to receive the package, resend the package, and then the transit time. Thus being about 2 weeks late instead of 4 days.

There is no reason why a company would think this is an intelligent way to deal with things. They are inventing delays. I will not deal with them again."
"Website gives error messages, sends you in circles, is super not user friendly. Navigating the website is as bad as calling customer support. Sometimes I feel bad using Amazon for everything, until I encounter a customer service experience like UPS.com and the call center."
"U.P.S. Likes to scam people by making out an online import charge and then when you pay it, U.P.S. Charges your credit card an extra $5.65 over the original invoice charge. If they do this to just 100,000 customers they will get an extra $565,000.00 dollars in someones pocket, it's a good little scam to make out invoices and then over charge."
UPS as a company is not worth of getting even one star. The company blackmailed us to get our own package for which we had paid already from the origin. The information was ambiguous from customer service and Brokerage department (this solves the custom). The custom cleared our package but UPS asked for more money to release the package which was never told us while we gave package at origin. We felt tortured for 4 days while talking to UPS.
"Firstly, I never agreed to your services. I have received a huge number of packages under the exact same circumstances and ONLY YOU decide to tack on random extra charges later on. On top of that, I only received your first bill when it was already ""overdue"" and so you wanted even more money for that.

The answer is no.

I have now reached out countless times about this invoice. I have spoken to many CS representatives, and have on numerous occasions been told that this invoice will be canceled, and that I will receive an update IMMEDIATELY.

This process has been ongoing for almost three months now.

And yet, nothing ever happens. Not a single email from you, not a single acknowledgement as soon as the phone is hung up. And now your ""collections department"" doesn't even answer the phone. This is getting absolutely ridiculous.

I now have yet another bill from you stating that this will go to collection.

Stop these predatory and incredibly unprofessional practices. I have had enough."
No idea how they can call themselves a delivery company. I have been waiting two weeks for a package which I have now cancelled as they seem to refuse to load it on to a deliver van. After a week of calling them I found out they had marked a pair of shoes as TOO BIG TO DELIVER!! The customer service team are useless and just offer fake apologies and no answers and like the delivery team seem unable to do their jobs.
"Parcel arrived earlier than expected, but the delivery driver was very rude and not friendly."
"I contacted UPS 7 times since 29/12/21, My package was sent to a pick-up point without my complete name. The shopowner refused to give it to me and insulted me. UPS said they will deliver it to my home, now 3 weeks later, my package is still at the pick up point, or somewhere else, I don’t even know.
Contacted them 7 times, don't know what could I do more."
"Paid a very high rate for second day air delivery it is being 7 days and they still have not delivered my parcel
Everyday it keeps saying rescheduled for delivery.
They refuse to list it as lost so I can file a claim so they can hold me ransom for my money
Trying to talk to them is a nightmare because everybody is offshore they can barely speak English and they have no idea how their system operates they have no sop and my phone has more updated increments than their website does.
I refuse to use these people for anything in the future anything at all"
"Had a delivery tonite (88081). Waited in front of the window for 2 hours watching for the brown truck. A penske moving truck shows up. What's this? I go to the door and step out on my porch. See a driver (girl pony tail under her hat). Weird. Must be my delivery. Step in, put my shoes on and step back out to go get my package. She drives off, never getting out of the truck. Ten minutes layer I get an Attempted Delivery alert. Too bad. They'll try again tomorrow. What the hell! Somebody should be fired."
Drivers just leave your packages anywhere they feel like. Twice I had to file a claim for missing packages. I even have my address right where they can see it. They need to be more careful and considerate.
I don't know who received my package but it wasn't me. Customer service is one star as well. Thankfully I am able to use Amazon for most things. They really seem to have it together. It is pretty rare for me to order directly from a company but the supply chain has caused so many shortages. I figure if a new company can like amazon can get it right then there's gotta be some one who can take UPS's place. Lets hope it happens soon
"It is unbelievably bad service!
It's been second time when I received the below
""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer pick up."" - this is annoying because I am working from home and there is not chance that I am not at home and even if I am not they could call me several times and not once and just put that status! I am paying for delivery and after all, I should look for my packages on their site and then go to the pick-up point! What a service!
Is there any chance to select a delivery company when you are ordering in Amazon?"
"1. I sent my computer items from the UK to USA after being finally reunited with my other half after a 2 years wait - I packed everything in a 20 kg box with 200 Bursting point (double walled) in many layers of bubble wrap, tissue paper and plastic bags and I paid extra for warranty up to 1000 GBP
2. I received the items in the USA one week later after I was supposed to receive them with my PC screen scratched, tower scratched and elements fallen, UK 3 pin for the printer bent to 45 degrees angle as well as a mirror destroyed and a PC connector also destroyed - proof the ground UPS staff dropped my parcel at least once from human height. Even if everything was surrounded by polystiren, trust me, when you drop a box, the shock of hitting the ground will affect everything in the box!!!

UPS refused to pay despite paying for the warranty saying the items were not correctly packaged and is my fault!!!! They have no shame and the reviews here and on the social media prove they are useless and anything is about them against us, the customer!!!"
Terrible. It's impossible to remain calm when calling UPS. Horrenduos and insulting customer service!
"Lost parcel and claim that they have tried to contact me which they have not done. Would give them zero stars, if I could. Worst delivery company ever."
"""Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point™ for customer pick up.""

Jeg var hjemme hele dagen...."
"I used to work as a manger for UPS. After an abusive and stressful two years I quit. I ship zero packages from my businesses through UPS. Unfortunately products I buy from other companies still use UPS as their preferred shipment carrier. Absolutely horrible company.

I could write page after page of problems and issues I've had with UPS personally while working there and after the fact. One example was a simple gift card from Columbus Ohio to Indianapolis Indiana. Value of gift card was $500 for a Charity event Grand Opening prize fundraiser for kids. Over TWO WEEKS after scheduled delivery date I thought ""weird I have all notifications turned on through my UPS account. I wonder where my package is?"" After checking online its over TWO WEEKS LATE showing ""IN TRANSIT"".... No one called, No one emailed, No automated system notified me it was lost, NOTHING. After contacting UPS they refused to process the claim for me and insisted I do it myself. After being placed on hold and talking with multiple customer service representatives turns out I was correct and my account needed UPS TEAM to unlock it due to the locking me out of the account. Finally got a claim submitted with a level 2 customer service rep. New shipment is sent with another $500 REPLACEMENT gift card.

Then guess what....?
UPS loses this gift card ALSO!! SURPRISE!! I'm done and will never use or recommend UPS services after years and years of disappointments. Unbelievable."
"6 December 2921 UPS picks up an envelope from my home address in Ireland. Recipients is a 19-year old friend of mine in Russia. 8 December the envelope arrives in Moscow airport. The envelope contains a Christmas present. To make a long story shorter, the envelope never left the warehouse till 11 January 2022, so more than a month later. UPS Moscow wants recipients company information. I emailed that there is no company - no business, just a private gift for a friend. She lives 700km east of Moscow, but the envelope stays in Moscow and UPS does not call her. UPS asks for a copy of her passport. I email the ID pages. The very next day UPS decides to return the envelope to Ireland. The envelope arrived in their Irish warehouse on 12 January 2022. They do not deliver it back to me, because ""the address is incomplete"", even though they knew how to pick it up from the same address. It is now more than a week later, and still nothing, even after lots of emails and phone calls. Forget about UPS !"
"Literally the worst website to use to track a package.

Instead of give accurate updates about delivery, they push it out one day at a time.

Would recommend to use another parcel carrier."
"I prefer not go give any stars unless it's a minus.
Driver has threatened me and my packages multiple times. I have reported him and nothing is done. So now he has effed with my packages and haven't received them. Called again about this issue... Still waiting for a response.
Not that this should happen to anyone but the packages being delivered are for my elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimer's Dementia and they are from Hospice."
"I send three times big size parcel everytime I had troubles with the carriers the parcels was damage, wet, and eaten by rats. Now on the third one I send four packages under one parcel so one gone missing while we was waiting for the parcel to reappear than second out of four gone missing and they tell us to wait because they can't deliver the parcel without the remaining two, so now I guess we are waiting until the rest of the parcel will go missing and the price of what's inside the Parcel is £2,000 and I paid clearance £500 and the UPS charge me £700 I was very disappointed on their service."
Ups store-Dean Taylor Crossing- Andrew was so kind to me that I couldn’t believe that young man was so kind to old lady like I am. I have return merchandise to Amazon. I couldn’t find the information that I purchased and I was stressed out. Andrew saw my condition and he offered me a chair to sit on. He helped me to find the all information that I need. Thank you very much Andrew. You are the Best!! He even open the door for me.

Complete and utter backward company.."
"I should be getting my package delivered on Monday. The road conditions was not great because of the ice. I understand. It rescheduled to Tuesday. Today(Tuesday), the road conditions was much better, we had FedEx and postal workers came by dropping mails. The scheduled timeframe from 12-4pm was changed to by 9pm. By 7:15pm, when I tracked the truck, it’s almost backed to ups station! The truck was just a couple of streets by my house. By 7:30pm, it’s rescheduled to tomorrow 4-6 pm. When I called ups, the rep assured me it will be delivered tonight before 9pm! And told me since I don’t trust what she said she can transfer the call to her manager. If I can see where the truck is, why can’t she??? I am not confident I will get my package tomorrow."
"Got an invoice for customs and all these extra fees for $115 tacked onto my package. They just dropped off the package at the door and sent the invoice. The invoice had a due date that was Dec. 21st and I received the invoice on Dec. 23rd. Talked to the UPS rep--non negotiable, ok, so I paid the bill and pointed out that it was received after the due date. Now, I get another invoice for a late payment charge and this is due two days from now. This is such a dishonest company!"
"They give you a 3 hour time frame (1-4 pm), allow you to follow your delivery, you see the driver pass your house 3 different times to make other deliveries that are within your same time frame.. here it is now 3:45 pm and he's moving farther away. Why not just say expected delivery around or after 4m? because it seems like it's heading that way. Worst delivery service EVER!!! This is not the first time.. happened several times and each time has been a different area, so it's not the driver, it's the process."
"I live in Thailand and have problems with shipping companies once in a while and I used to think that the worst shipping services were in Thailand. How I am wrong when I meet UPS. They clearly win the title. I ordered a jacket from Macy's to deliver at my stay. I was out when they delivered it and left a note for me to pick it up at a nearby pickup point. I went to the place 2 days after the date on the note and the guys there said they had no package for me. I tried to reach the customer service and after 10-15 minutes stumbling and manipulating through their idiotic 'contact us' links, was finally able to speak with a person who said she could not track the package for me and the only way I could do was to tell Macy's about the incident. And I thought I was from a third world country!"
"January 17, 2022 high winds and snow. Received an email from the company I ordered from stating my pkg. had been delivered, checked all the doors no pkg. We have a 450 ft long driveway and the UPS man tied the pkg to the driveway marker at the end near the highway, instead of walking up the driveway not to mention he could have easily drove up the driveway. I am disabled and my husband was at work needless to say by the time he got home at 7pm the pkg was gone. Not sure if the wind took it, traffic or snowplow, or if someone stole it. Then trying to call them you can't speak to a person everything has to be done on line its totally ridiculous. UPS used to be my favorite carrier but the past 2 years the company has really gone down. There young new employees just don't care and have no respect or responsibility. It's just 😔"
Hopeless service. Never delivered to me - sent to a pickup store. Called 6 times over the next 8 days - explaining that I could not pick up and package must be delivered. Cust. service assured me - each time - that package would be delivered - never arrived and on the 10th day was sent back to sender. Horrible service will never use again.
"Hi,

First my parcel was at your Stanford let hope facility for three weeks) next you told me that you've got it at custom office and it's not meeting the restrictions and after you are telling me that's missing. In this parcel are priceless memories which no money will refunded. It's something strange happening over there. How is it possible to lost 25kg parcel ?"
"I scheduled pickup twice, was charged for pickup. Drivers never brought labels as they were instructed so packages weren’t picked up each time. Speaking to customer service several times was horrible as most were foreign which created a language barrier of understanding. Have now made a 3rd request for pickup & based on the call I’m pretty sure I will have the same issue again tomorrow. I have my whole little apartment packed in six boxes that are sitting at the front desk of the hotel I just checked out of. I have nothing but what I took on the plane ride home! I just want my stuff. Do better UPS."
I ordered a package last year in 2021 and it's is now January 17 2022. After filing the lost package claim and sending all information needed for a refund they now tell me the shipper will receive my $300 whenever they get the chance to send them the paperwork that I already sent with the claim. The absolute worst shipping service I have ever used. I don't even know if I will ever receive my package or my money seeing that the shipper has a no refund policy. I will never use this shipping service and if I am ordering from a company that uses them I will go elsewhere as to actually receive the package.
"If I could leave 0 stars I WOULD! Honestly the WORST shipping company ever! I would never ever use or trust them with your packages! I’m waiting for my package, all of a sudden I get a notification saying sorry we missed you. THEY NEVER KNOCKED ON MY DOOR! I go into the ups store to pick up my package and they tell me it’s out for delivery! This company is a joke and I hope they go out of business!"
I had left a note on my door for my package to go to my neighbor who is 3 houses up across from house they disregard the note..I thought someone had stole it thank GOD for good neighbors & I have good neighbors..they wouldn't do that if that was their package...
"Awful!!!!! I packaged a beautiful dream catcher for my mother. I packaged it well. No movement, everything packed and sturdy. Arrived in pieces to my mom. Stop man-handling packages. Literally how awful to think that we entrust a package to the UPS team and it's literally torn to shreds. I am heart broken at the lack of decency your workers have towards others people packages we TRUSTED YOU with."
NO STARS AT ALL! The worst Service for delivery that has ever. UPS Customer Service agent said the Transfer of the package supposed to be 1 to 2 days for delivery. Always a Month & more. Like the package is coming from CHINA. Any business using it STOP! You will loose CUSTOMERS. EXTREMELY HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SHIPPING Service.
"It took 20 min to get through to UPS on phone. They had reported three attempts to deliver a package when only one notice was left. It had been explained that three attempts were not trialed, however, this fell on deaf ears. They sent package back to sender and were not able to provide information pertaining to sender (so I could reach out to them personally to ask for resending of package). I am left without package and/or any way to contact the sender of the package. Omar (supervisor) was very kind but I am disappointed with the lack of follow through on behalf of UPS and their lack of willingness to fix the breakdown in miscommunication."
"Worst answering service ever! I've been calling for 3 days now to hold a package I do what it tells me, and then it just hangs up. Good luck doing anything calling the lakewood nj office 1800#. I will never use ups again."
"i sender the package to Brasil with Money back Guaranteed 4 day delivery, after 15 days let me know and the receiver the import tax 513,41 EUR !!!!! Calculated totally incorrectly!!! Value of the package 389,34 EUR !
i waiting to receive back the package!!!
and the additional cost 100 EUR phone bill to calling up brasil ups 4 times because people don`t do his job!!!! i used 3rd times this was the first time ,last time and never again!!!!!! Ups before was very good company now just rip you off!!"
"If you want your package delivered, DO NOT use UPS.
If you want customer service, DO NOT use UPS.

If you want to throw money outside your window, USE UPS!"
"The worst postal service in the world!

For many times now, UPS fails to delivery to my home (in downtown) and always many days late! This is because my address has a Danish letter in it and UPS's system can't read Danish letters. How is this even allowed if you work in Denmark?!

The customer service are the worst and never helpful. I have tried to explain my problem to them many times now and that It is very important my package doesn't get delayed again, and they simply tell me ""let's give it another try and if the driver can't guess the missing letter in your address, you will just have to come pick it up in our warehouse in Glostrup (hundreds of kilometers away from me!!!).

What the hell is this? How can a postal service not be able to contact their driver and let them know that the address on the package has a missing letter?

Simply the worst!!!"
"Really poor communication
Order from the UK has still not been delivered despite landing in South Africa a week ago. I have had to contact UPS three times via phone to ensure I receive the correct invoice for clearance."
This is in no way directed at the drivers never had a problem with the driver. I do however have a problem with UPS it’s self. I have a package that should’ve been here Friday they can’t give me a clear reason as to why my package has not arrived and told me I would have to check back on Monday for an update on where my package is at. Essentially they are holding my package hostage the way I’m taking it UPS the drivers are great UPS itself sucks
They don't care about your package and never be on time. Customers should follow up with their package every time they call them because your package will sleep on their facility for a long time till someone pushes your package through.

"Out of all my years this is first time I have seen such bad customer service for ups . We really need to find another company to take and deliver our packages. Why support a bad company such as this . Each person said something different not one person I talked to ask for my apartment number if that was the issue not one so how the heck were they going to drop it off . You have to pay to pick up your own freaking package last I checked it would have been the same freaking gas it was to bring it , I am telling you they are getting worse ."
package on way everyday dont show up my another claim
"I had to sign to get my package. They couldn't give me a time. I paid extra to pick it up on Saturday. Drive there to find out they are closed on Saturday and Sunday. Monday through Friday, they are only open 10 am to 2 pm. I guess anyone that works for a living is out if luck."
"I have waited here 3 days to sign for package. Each day I receive an email stating they will be here today and I must be here. I missed my daughters basketball tournament because they said they would be here today. Now they say that they tried to deliver but our business is closed and they cant. This is a residence with a sign on the door just for UPS. They told me to be here and I am. Now they tell me to wait here a third day. They have hung up on me when I told them I am here, not a closed business. I am a man, here, waiting for them to arrive only because they tell me the night before and the morning they will be here, to wait.

Update
They have said they would be here and then rescheduled two more times.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday and now Tuesday. I do not care if they are late, just do not tell me you will be here, to wait to sign and then not show up. The problem is breaking their own appointment to meet me here over and over. They make the appointment to meet me here, not me. Then they fail to show up day after day. Their customer support do not care at all. None of them do. So I decided I would cancel my order with the seller and let them know why. They have now lost a $3800 sale due to UPS"
"UPS is worst! If there is -1 star it should be! I have been waiting for my package for so long paid extra fees just to tell me that i am not available when they trying to deliver to my address(mind you, i didnt receive any call or text that theyre here or ring my bell) then asked me to pickup from their location!!"
"I ordered cat food through Amazon Prime to get Prime delivery, what I get instead is UPS not delivering my package after 3 days of notification that the next day would be the day. I finally tricked their phone inquiry hurdle system; 3 calls later, into letting me speak with a person. That person stated their name indecipherably 3 times on purpose, as to not be identifiable... then spoke to me in a very broken English ish type of way. They did understand my tracking number and verified my address had been correct, even though the driver was turning in the address as not correct. Customer service also guaranteed that I would receive my starving cats food today (1-15-22). I gave a phone number for contact, if needed. An hour later someone called from *******200 stating that it was "" impossible"" to deliver my package today, yet I could drive to pick it up. He also called my 2nd phone and not the one I gave customer service. It is as possible for me to pick it up, as it is for you to deliver it... it is more professional for you to deliver it and more possible, being it is twice the mileage for me to pick it up. I will be letting Amazon know that my deliveries are never to be made by UPS ever again. Please merge your name with FedEx and Prime to get rid of the circus act known as UPS. Your systems are terrible and you underperform what a group of chimpanzees could do. Start with getting me my package today and fire the worker who called the wrong number saying that it was "" impossible"" to deliver today (3 days late)."
"My UPS is the BEST! The staff are friendly, courteous, informative, and professional."
"THEY ARE THE WORST!!!!!! THEY WILL STEAL FROM YOU!!!! THEY ARE SATANS LITTLE SISTER!!!!!!!!


JUST USE USPS!!!! AT LEAST THEY HONOR THE CLAIMS WHEN THEY MESS UP.... UPS WILL JUST LIE"
"The app is not accurate in showing how the address of the recipient is written on the package. That discrepancy compelled me to add to the address which delayed delivery by a day and even then not to trust what was on the package. The address on the package turned out to be correct after all, no thanks to the app.

The tracking map was very slow to update and stayed inaccurate. In my case, which is unusual, I could see where the truck was and the map was in the ballpark for location, but not in the game.

The app is better than nothing, but it could do better."
"I have had 2 recent packages sent to me through ups. 1 of them said it would be delivered on January 3rd, then the 4th then the 5th then it was lost, then I guess they finally found it a week plus later. It was at their facility 15 miles from my house on 12/31. Next an item that was supposed to be here on Monday, Jan 10th, rescheduled for Thursday, then Friday, now who knows. It left their facility, which is 15 miles away from me, at 10:01 am and said it would be here by 9:pm. I can't stay up too late, I have to be up at 4:30 am. It is 9:40 pm and it still says out for delivery and they have not gotten here yet."
"I sent some sentimental antique items with UPS at a HUGE cost because I expected good service. That is, to get them undamaged. These were well packed by me and UPS and should have arrived in one piece. But NO, they arrived in pieces. Shattered. UPS knew they were somewhat fragile but didn't even bother to write that on the boxes. Probably would not have mattered. I might as well have sent the items with the US Postal Service at 1/10th the price. Beyond disappointed. Does UPS understand that they should be providing a premium service? After all, they are charging premium prices. Never again will I use their service to send anything."
"Package left Goodyear AZ on January 12th, I live 30 miles away, today is the 14th, I watched the ups truck turn around in my driveway and drive off, it Is Friday so possibly a happy hour emergency, just close your doors and give up clearly you can't do your job, 94% bad reviews um hello.......... grab head pull from a$$ game over..."
"UPS drivers I have dealt with have all been very professional. It is a shame they work for such a bad company. The phone reps are all on a script, have heavy accents and are very hard to understand. I spent over 4 hours and 2 days on trying to get a pickup. the person setting up the pickup put in the wrong address. When I called to correct it they canceled it instead. when I finally got the address right they changed the price of the pickup. I checked the price before I phoned to set it up. I was told the price to Ocean View Hi was 13.26, the price went to 18.86 with the last guy. Standard Corp. practice, insulate the brass and keep repeating the Corp. talking points. This is not a company that I want to do business with, USPS does much better and is way more convenient."
"The ups company is the poor shipping company, they will charge the package delivery cost alot with extra strength reason. I don’t recommend to with this company at all"
"UPS may ""run the tightest ship in the shipping business"", but unfortunately, that ship appears to be the Titanic. I orders some components from an automotive site, and the products were shipped on UPS. Initially, the production was supposed to be delivered on a Thursday, this got delayed until Friday, then Saturday, then the next Monday. After Monday, UPS notified that damage had occurred during shipment, and that product would be returned to the company (shipper). Then, the next day, the product was delivered to me (damaged of course). It's now sitting here, while I'm waiting for the shipper and UPS to resolve return."
Truck number 854984 on amber drive in Oxford pa the driver / delivery guy I Overheard him delivering he was impressively polite and courteous when dropping off package to the customer workers like that deserve recognition !
"Dreadful service, they have the worst tracking and notification service ever, all email notifications constantly change, I was informed of a delivery for Friday, on Friday PM they rescheduled for Monday, so I went out for a 30min run and they tried to deliver on the Friday after rescheduling for Monday? Then said it was at the local collection point of the day, then emailed 20mins later to say they could not deliver to their own arranged collection point, what a disgraceful company!"
"Very bad service
They goona lose my business.
I am going to put my review in all mein friends and family members who are using their service.

These people are just piece of _____."
very good came on time driver very helpful
Package arrived within a few days and without any issues at all. There were frequent updates to my tracking which I appreciated. I've only had a few packages delivered with UPS but haven't had any issues yet.
"99% of the products my household uses is delivered. Thank goodness so few retailers use UPS to deliver my goods as you can absolutely count on a delivery issue or damaged package if your package happens to be routed through a Ft. Worth, Texas UPS hub. Clearly the employees take very little pride in what they do. Based on several recent articles, even the US Postal service is blowing UPS away with respect to on-time deliveries. You suck UPS."
"UPS has gone from being my preferred shipper to one I will only use as a last resort / no other choice. I was scheduled for 5 different shipments to be delivered today, one is getting close to being a month behind its initial delivery date. All but 1 of today's deliveries have been delayed at least 1 day. I actually did get a delivery 2 days ago for 1 package, meanwhile the other 2 packages that were being tracked as being on the same vehicle were not delivered. When contacting customer service they try giving me the same excuse shown on the tracking, which is severe weather. That's not acceptable. When your drivers are in my neighborhood delivering packages, especially when you actually deliver one to me, but you fail to deliver my other packages, that's just incompetence. I would have been okay with them being more transparent about the issue. But just trying to blame bad weather, when we've had beautiful weather in this area, and all of my packages are tracking in this area, and your drivers are literally driving past my house, doesn't cut it. If your company isn't competent enough to deliver my packages, own up to it and call or email me letting me know and offer me alternative solutions to get my packages. While I'd rather not have to drive myself over to a UPS shipping center or store to pick up my packages, I would much rather do that then not get them at all. Don't tell me you're going to deliver if you can't.
There is no excuse for a company like UPS not to have better tracking technology and procedures in place that would allow any packages to be stuck in a perpetual ""sorry we can't deliver today, we'll deliver it tomorrow instead"" loop."
"Getting items damaged, can not get in touch with customer service, ever. Hate automated system. Told me to have box ready for pickup, 2 days no show. I dont get it and cant ask anyone about that."
"Received notification my package was due to be delivered between 12:00 and 16:00, so I went out shopping in the morning.
Got home at 11:45 and discovered UPS had tried to deliver the parcel at 9:00 so I had the hassle of going to pick it up from the nearest drop off point.
Can't rely on their timing so useless for me."
There is no way to talk to a person at this company
"Item ordered on Sunday 2nd January, was delivered on 4th January. Superb service!"
"TLDR: UPS drivers and support staff just don't care. Parcel not delivered to me, who knows where it is now. UPS no help at all when I phoned them (twice). I will make a point of finding out which courier an online shop uses, if it is UPS then I will shop elsewhere."
Im ashamed of UPS what has happened to this once good company? I ordered from the UK and the parcel disappeared - but UPS registered it as delivered - not to an adress but a code. They could not tell me what the code meant. Promise after promise was made to return my calls but no. On my third call I demanded their subcontractor here in Norrland. I called Lastbilsstationen and guess what? They had the parcel (shocker) and now will deliver it. Why didn't UPS contact them? Their customer service is zero - they did nothing.
"I wished I had checked reviews for delivery services before, I somehow thought UPS was a reputable business but clearly it isn't.
Tried to send a parcel to Italy for which I was asked to pay duties two weeks ago, this information was lost and the receiver is being asked to pay again. They don't seem to be able to send the payment information to Italy to release the package and the line in Italy simply gets cut off.
The customer service keeps telling me a different thing and I've been going around in circles and this is not sorted. NEVER AGAIN."
Left a expensive rug outside at the front door when it was raining. I was home they only had to ring the door bell
F**king s**t service! F**king scammers are they! You can not get in touch with them when it comes to bills! The worst courier service in the world. No wonder why they only have 1 stars f***ing r*tards!
"Absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced. Lost irreplaceable family photos and heirlooms after 2 months of no word from them. On call to representative to follow up was told, oh it's been 2 months it's lost. No apology from them or any hope of finding parcel. Spoke to customer service manager seems like there is literally zero training for employees when they can't even apologise. Even a fake apology would have been nice."
"Incompetent Driver/Delivery/Poor Service
Package scheduled for delivery on Thursday. Package not delivered. Receive tracking info saying delivery rescheduled for Friday. Package does not arrive. Received email saying package delivery rescheduled for Saturday. Package still has not arrived. Receive email saying rescheduled and package will arrive next business day, Monday, package does not arrive. Receive email rescheduled and package will arrive Tuesday, driver's says attempted to pick up. What!!! it's a delivery..no package arrives. Received email rescheduled delivery for Wednesday. Screw that, my husband used gps, tracked down UPS driver and collected our package. Email say package was delivered and at your front door. Lol. Btw, called UPS 4 times, 3 days in a row. Person takes phone number and says UPS will call me. No call."
"Uncompetent people, the package arrived at the local center before the get out for delivery and those losers they lost my package. I mean if you don’t want to see the importance of delivering properly AND ON TIME the package, change your job whoever the F you are, let somebody who’s more motivated to work"
Package scheduled for delivery on Monday. Package not delivered. Receive tracking info saying delivery rescheduled for Tuesday. Package does not arrive. Received email saying package delivery rescheduled for Wednesday. Package still has not arrived. Receive email saying need updated address. Call UPS. Address on Package was correct. Person takes phone number and says UPS will call me. No call. Package still not here. Driver appears to be incompetent as thought address was for apartment complex when should have been delivered to single family home.
"Always late. This time it is for ""severe weather"". It is 54º and cloudy. Nothing severe about it.

And no, this package is not going through severe weather to get to me, it is in the same city.

Next time I will use USPS, they are on time. I also dont get bullschit excuses from them.

I cant wait for UPS and FEDEX to go out of business, they both do a schit job."
"Ups charged me an additional fee over and above what had been agreed. No explanation. I have tried resolving this through customer services but after two months of chasing nothing has happened except being promised to expedite the matter, without any resolution. Customer service does not exist with this company and I would advise anyone to look elsewhere for parcel deliveries."
"Every time ups delivers a package to my house it never gets to my house they alway deliver to wrong address, they need to start taking pictures like Amazon of where the package was left and they also need to get on their drivers asses about doing that like sometimes it’s expensive stuff and some people will keep your package if it gets delivered to their house all people ain’t honest people. This pisses me off so much all y’all gotta do is look at the address on the box and the address you in front of"
"This is a terrible company. The rescheduled my delivery 4 times, I had to stay at home for 3 out of the 4 times. They have still not delivered the package. I called their customer service number, the call went to a machine with pre-programmed questions. When I asked to be put to an agent, the call went off.

A bit confused as to whether to request a refund for my items from the shipper as I am honestly tired of waiting and expecting my package. This has sapped my focus over the last couple of days."
"UPS is a service of bad quality, poor time estimation, unreliable and if you have to depend on these guys for something: you will be frustrated! I definitely wouldn't recommend it to even my enemy (if I had one)!"
"DONT USE UPS....if you have doubts, look at their ratings. The only thing that impresses me with this company is that they still exist ??????"
"On a shipment from UK to Norway where seller charged VAT but kept it for themselves (Country Attire), there was no help from UPS to get. Albeit this was not their fault, it would be nice to get help from someone who knows the rules and regulations.
BUT, the sh#t from UPS really got good when they now want to collect the same AGAIN.. Their second VAT bill, with ""customs handling"" fee again too of course. That will be the THIRD time I pay VAT for the same item.... Don't pay you say...? They'll just push the bill through a payment collector firm... As a customer you have no power, EXCEPT this... Write reviews!"
Well what can I say but that I will never order anything again if the courier is UPS. Three dates for delivery and all rescheduled with no reason given. Last date and time given and they didn’t turn up !!! no word from them. I had waited in all day to no avail. The rug came the next day fortunately I was in … still no apology but to blame covid.
"Ups is ripoff for international they are very expensive postal rate and very hi charges coustom clearance
I paid $30 + $60 coustom clearance
For 200 value gift"
"The representative took computer, I want to ship to my daughter, who leave 50 miles away from my house. I dropped the item on Friday with promise to have the item delivered next day. They charged me extra for the next day delivery + Saturday delivery.
The item went across America and cam to my daughter facility next day 9 AM.... but was delivered on Monday!

Why I was charged? The customer support gave me the following:
1. Bad weather(the weather had not been changed).
2. UPS does NOT deliver on Saturday???

The bottom line: DO NOT pay extra for Saturday delivery!!!!!!"
"Very poor customer service and communication. I change my delivery option to pick up at a drop point, selected to be notified. UPS never notified my package was at drop point nor did tracking update. I received a notification when the package had been returned to sender because it sat at the drop point for 10 days without giving any updates. Should give -20 stars for their unprofessional services."
Customer service dont know squat keep transferring you around.payed for 3 day shipping been 8 still not delivered should have went fedex envelope mailed to barbados they shipped to Dublin guess they didn't finish on how to read now they said they reprint label to go to barbados but wow its the same label and tracking number I did 8 days ago I STRONGLY RECOMMEND FEDEX OVER UPS INTERNATIONAL AFTER THIS BIG ISSUE AND SPOT THEY PUT ME IN FROM NOT DELIVERING LIKE THE PROMISED!!!!!!!!!
"If I could give this company ZERO stars, I definitely would. Customer service is a f!cking joke, and the drivers are pathetically lazy and dishonest. I had a credit card that was supposed to be delivered two weeks ago. I never saw it, and the agent who called me about my package could not have been more disinterested. UPS is GARBAGE, and I would not recommend anyone to use this shipping service."
Terrible company. I was told they do not cater to business. I do not open until 1pm. They have to deliver during business hours. I would call everytime they would say they would fix it. Then it happens again and again. For twelve years of complaining. Then when the general manager told me we do not cater to businesses. I said then why do you charge them shipping. I was like so you mean to tell me we pay you to ship and deliver our products. Just to not deliver them properly. Then I get reshopping fees because they didn’t leave a tag and kept coming when I was closed. So the products I need get shipped back. Sounds to me like a bunch of morons who don’t wanna do the job we pay them to do. Ship with anyone else I wouldn’t waste my time
Horrible service. I was transferred multiple times to the wrong department. I was eligible for a refund from the bond cancellation and it disappeared I guess and nobody wants to help. All I keep getting is the run around.
"Trash company. Doesn't ring/knock.
Entire website is bugging and support links to 404 pages.

I wouldn't trust them with a promo flyer."
"How to begin, my packages made it to the local ups with a out for delivery on Sat between 2-6 pm. 6 rolled around no package. Then it changed to 10 pm. Well come 10 pm still no packages. So I check with tracking. Now it's say being processed then the next day it states check back tomorrow for delivery schedule. The point of this rant is who ever was in charge of tracking details screwed the pooch on this one. I'm not certain what the issue was but an unable to load package on the truck would have been nice. With all the package thieves around I had no idea if it was stolen half the time. I would rather a straight up sorry we couldn't get it on the truck over worrying if it was stolen. I did finally get my packages. So that is a plus."
"Just wanted to thank our UPS driver, Danny. Have tried to call and email, but am unable to do so. He is a wonderful caring person who handles our deliveries in a great manner and always makes sure our packages are safe from theft and weather. He is very much appreciated as he delivers medical packages to us and always makes sure we know where to find them, He is awesome. Too bad UPS makes it impossible to directly commend a driver. He delivers to Sterling, Va. in the 20164 area. Hope he sees this message, however I doubt it!!!!!"
"UPS was great, got my new boots in just a few days."
"I needed to send my new passport from Finland to the UK, so needless to say that it was a very important delivery. Therefore, instead of using a cheaper Finnish mail service, I used ""more reliable"" UPS (or so I thought) and paid for the next business day guaranteed delivery. The package was sent on 2.12.2021, 13th December I was told my parcel was lost. So what would be a next-day delivery took them around two weeks to realise that is lost.

What caused even more trouble was that I was supposed to work from home for only one day to sign my package. However, as the tracking status changed continuously, I needed to stay at home three more days, which caused trouble for my work.

An investigation was started, and of course, they could not locate the parcel. On 27th, I sent my paperwork for the claim, and I have not received a single update from UPS. I needed to contact them myself to know what was happening. I called the UPS customer service, where a person told me a member of the claims team would be in touch with me over the phone; however, no one has called me.

Now I called them again, and the person (called herself Mary Sam), admitted that the previous customer service person lied to me. She also told me I would need to wait five weeks for the claim to be processed. So that is over two months since I was supposed to receive the package, which was very important for me.

The customer service is unknowledgeable with all the automatic replies, and I have felt like my concern is not taken seriously.

Needless to say, do not trust your important documents (or anything of value to you) with UPS. The only thing I could trust them with would be a Xmas card.


*** update: today I was given the below answer, after contacting the email address that was given to me by UPS Trustpilot team. So they just keep repeating the same answer via phone and email. I would genuinely appreciate if someone could actually read what J have said and address that.

Dear Sara,

According to our records, your claim is in progress, our team will contact you as soon as it is processed.

UPS UK Customer Care"
Received plenty of messages on status of the delivery. Eventually the delivery was delayed from one evening to the following morning but in current climate has to be expected.
Literally the worst experience with getting something delivered. Guaranteed 4 days. It’s approaching 3 weeks. The parcel has been sitting in 1 location for 11 days and every time I call get a different answer from each person. Use any other parcel delivery service. So good. Keep up the good work UPS
Bad service - they don’t deliver at your address and give various reasons and want you to pick up.
I have been waiting on a package I paid $30.00 for for over a week I live in Florida -it was here then they sent it to Virginia Aweful company no intelligent people Do not deal with them ever!!!!!!
"They are so incompetent that they delivered my package to the wrong city, but as you know they said I got it because it was delivered. Apparently they can not read either. How can I order something and not have them deliver?"
Most non organized delivery service there is next day delivery means nothing always late would never recommend using again worse tracking system doesn't update
"I ordered a package and it was being shipped by UPS, it was never delivered and it apparently was being sent back to the sender. I contacted UPS to see what was happening but they themselves didn't even know the problem. They didn't know why it was being sent back. I contacted the sender and they also has no idea why, they contacted UPS and got the same answer as me. I lost $1500 because of that, neither me or the sender got it back. And this was way back in the middle of December. I don't know how UPS is still operating, hopefully people use more of fedex or better shippers as this isn't reliable."
"I had a laptop shipped by my employer as "" Next Day Air"" on Friday, and UPS shipped ground and gave estimated delivery time as Monday 11am to 5pm. But even at 5:30pm there is no news of the package.
One would think, that since this was next day air, they would prioritize the delivery by ground and deliver by early Monday, but NO.
I had FEDEX packages shipped next day air, and packages were delivered by 10am next day.

I will never ever use UPS or would recommend anyone using UPS for shipping. Brown is losing ground when they should be improving to compete in the market with Fedex."
"Payed for UPS express was supposed to arrive on 1/3 got delayed to 1/7 delayed again to 1/10 and then pushed back to 1/11. Customer support lied to my face saying the parcel was in Edmonton on 1/7 and when I went to ups office they said that it still has not arrived in Edmonton. And it did not get into Edmonton until 1/10.
Garbage shipping, terrible support. Please don’t use this service"
"My package got delayed for the 5th time today. It was delivered in the regional center long before its first delivery attempt. Now, customer service says that I can request a delivery TODAY to a drop off point pick up location with a fee. Essentially, that means I can also compel a delivery with additional fees, but WHY when it was supposed to be delivered 1 week ago? (since excluding weekends). Customer service on chat was very dismissive and ignored my questions regarding whether a changed location request would delay it by a day or not. Not responsive, very hard to even get to the chat option. Tracking status is absolutely useless and arbitrary. Additionally, the excuse used is severe weather...what is that.. a small breeze? No snow, no rain, no ice..... just a petty excuse for incompetent scheduling/planning."
"UPDATE It is now 2/22/22 (shipped on 11/30/21), and now I am receiving late fee notices in addition to the double billing. Customer service is impossible to communicate with to get this resolved.

Needed to ship 8 boxes from the Netherlands to Colorado. Horrible experience overall. Now, one box still missing (returned to sender due to paperwork mistake made by the UPS shipping center) and continue to get massive bills even though I paid at shipping. No response from customer service."
"Package got delayed 3 times now. With delivery date changing every day. And tracking shows no package update since the 4th!
Called the number and no answer. No customer support at all."
THRERE IS NO CSTMOER SERVICE!!! automated system is of NO HELP WHATSOEVER
"I don't know why companies still use UPS for their shipments! I refused my order because UPS decided to charge DOUBLE the normal custom and duty fees. I guess they just pull a number out of thin air and make some bogus invoice for it. I have ordered the same types of order and it was always around $30 then jumped to $60.

My phone was shipped using this awful service. It hasn't snowed in a week but there is still a weather delay on my package when i receive everything else just fine and ON TIME! at the worst maybe delayed ONE day, not over a week!

worst shipping company around!"
They appreciate your money not your business.
"I thought auspost was the worst, until im using UPS. Driver didnt knock, if they made a mistake, they won't fix it, and even worse, saying that their driver don't have mobile phone at all and can't be contacted at all to fix their mistake. Avoid them at all costs"
"UPS has become the worst company, fighting for worst with FedEx Ground. In UPS case, the drivers lie on failed deliveries, on delivery attempts, on making scheduled visits, generally on whatever they want. UPS management puts in systems to eliminate all human customer support. Management also has no corrective actions for continuous errors in sorting facilities. Its all about ""sales"", and making good on the promise of the sale is of absolutely NO CONCERN WHAT SO EVER to UPS. (Also true of FedEx Ground). The USPS, screwed up as it is, looks good compared to UPS and FedExGround. Their website REFUSES to give the TRUTH. In my recent package non-delivery, it was clearly mis-sorted, took a trip from Aliso Viejo, CA (last stop before delivery truck) to Bell, CA (no where near), and then the next day back to Aliso Viejo again. Perhaps, if they sort it correctly this time, and there is actually a truck, it will make it on the truck. There WAS a truck from Aliso Viejo on Sat 1/8/22 when it was not delivered, because I got a different UPS delivery that day, from that truck, at 3:00pm. So, this was just normal UPS incompetence. But it is 50% of their deliveries these days. Half of them are screwed up somewhere. In the last mile, in the warehouse, in sort, in the long haul, on pickup, AT THE HOUSE (where the driver is to far behind and lies, or makes something up). Where ever. UPS Management DOES NOT CARE how there operation runs. USPS 2-day delivery is SO MUCH more reliable than these guys, at LESS MONEY."
"The worst transportation company ever. It is really surprising that Amazon is still using this company. They are not able to deliver goods in good shape. After first delivery when they deliver destroyed order I return this to Amazon and order new one. However, also the second order arrived very broken. Stay really far from this company if you can. They are group of unprofessional and incompetent people."
"This UPS delivery service is the worse I’ve seen. I bought a trampoline through Amazon Prime. Still can’t believe Amazon would trust UPS since they have their own delivery service. So I bought my item on Dec 28, and by the 31st, it arrived around my area. I’ve been following the truck through their website and the truck has passed my area Many Times. They were even at the end of my street at one point and still have been unable to deliver it. Today is the 8th of January and nothing still. Such a disappointment."
"My package arrived eventually! After being told delivery would be on a Tuesday it was then moved only hours before it was due to arrive, to a Thursday this happened again, just hours before it was expected to arrive l was told it would arrive between 9.15 and 13.15 on a Friday after 14.15 and still nothing l started to ask what had happened and why l couldn’t get any logical explanation. Before anyone from UPS contacted me the package arrived that night. Lousy service."
"Product delivered on the original date arbitrarily given by UPS, despite their acceptance and confirmation of a delayed delivery date requested by us. Therefore we were not at home and product left for over 2 days in very wet weather. Impossible to speak to a human being at UPS, and computerised systems for all communication give only a limited range of options- which of course suit UPS, not the customer. For example, you can’t complain about a failure to deliver at a revised time as confirmed by the UPS computer and yet sticking to an original date, which obviously suited them. Dishonest, unacceptable and possibly disastrous for the package delivered. Leaves me wondering what the ‘s’ in UPS stands for - a four-letter word?"
"What has happened to UPS is actually anyone from UPS looking at the reviews?
Years ago I will receive my parcel next day with ups now I'm waiting 5 days for parcel sent from UK to UK absolutely terrible, can't believe."
"I ordered a computer recently off of Newegg and we had to sign for it which I thought was fine. The first day the times would fit when I was at my house but it came 45+ after I left. Second day same thing LATE. Still night of day 2 and tomorrow we’re going to try going to the pickup point or whatever. They said they’ll “try again” n Monday even though they deliver stuff on the weekend all the time . If I don’t get it Monday they’ll send it back to Newegg and the deal I got it for will never be back. If you have the choice chose a different carrier that’s on time!!! Updating to 3 stars bc it was not that late, and it did get here"
"Never, I said never have I received my package on time with UPS, what a horrible service, it’s a shame a company like this still exist, unfortunately Costco use UPS with online purchases and this is my fifth time, my order supposed to be delivered a week ago, I live in a big city and still with UPS is like I live in Mars. Very very disappointed"
"If I could give this carrier a negative zero I would. Service is horrible, tracking for packages is damn near obsolete and updated info, might as well try lighting some wet wood in your fireplace!!!! Thanks for nothing ups!"
"I have to say that UPS pick-up service is pure trash. I had to ship 12 parcels within Canada before New Year cause I need to move to another city. I scheduled a pick up without pre printed labels, (I can’t drop-off since my car was already shipped out to the new place and I didn’t have a printer.) I scheduled for 9am-12pm, but the driver didn’t come until 7pm, and said that they couldn’t take parcels without labels whatsoever. I mean, 7pm, they didn’t even leave me any time to make other arrangements to help with the situation. That’s harsh, and I swear I’d never use UPS anymore.

Then things get funnier because I have to deal with them after I’m in the new city. I have to trade in my old iPhone, and the kit they sent is using UPS. Since my car is still on the way, I decided to schedule a pick up service with them again, cause this time, guess what, I have a label ! (included in the kit.) what’s funny is that the pick up guy didn’t even show up this time.
Good job UPS, for treating customers so professionally."
I ordered an iPad the was supposed to arrive January 4. That day I was notified it was “out for delivery”. It is now January 7 and it’s still showing “out for delivery. I tried to contact UPS and was unable to reach a person only a bot that told me to use the tracking number.
"In this day in age you would assume a company as large as UPS would have a better sorting process but it's very untrustworthy. You cannot trust at all the updates provided to you, it's like a lottery ticket wether you will get your package or not and the updates are horrible might as well not provide any, saves you the disappointment. Also if they say they will call you back they won't wait an hour or so & you call them back instead, you gotta do it yourself otherwise you will never get anything resolved. The workers are nice though."
"Goddamn, it is awful.
Awful, awful, awful."
2 parcels were lost in a row... Infinite attempts to deliver until it becomes status Damage Reported...
"Still waiting on a Christmas present sent by my sister on 17 December. Firstly they kept changing the date on the delivery. Went from 22 Dec to 29th then 5 January
After waiting in for most of day my sister rang them and they said they were missing a customs form which was sellotaped to parcel. I rang them and they sent me out two pages import form. It was a present. We are not companies. Anyway after three more calls and several emails was promised it would be delivered today. Guess what. No sign so it’s probably stolen. If only my sister had looked at the comments on their Facebook page. Every post has at least 30 bad comments all replied to asking for private message. Please do not use this dreadful company as they deserve to be bankrupt"
"My package has been at the local warehouse for over a week, has been out for delivery multiple times and still has yet to actually be delivered...my house is 1 mile away from there.
They show you information on tracking and then hide that it has been out for delivery multiple times when you check back later in the day. Over all I find it interesting they think its ok to lie and cover up the multiple times they have changed the status of deliveries to customers.
They do not deliver, and then mark it as a weather delay...guess what we have not had severe weather enough to stop anyone from working. I will never choose UPS again if I have the option in the future, I would rather pay double some where else than use their useless service again, especially as now they don't even guarantee delivery anymore. My package could have just been put in a regular mail box and it would have arrived days ago.
If they cant deliver a package when its a mile away from their warehouse, then they cant be trusted for anything else."
"Like everyone else in here it’s impossible to get a hold of anyone in customer service and even if you do they are completely and utterly useless. Package delivery time got delayed 3 days now with no explanation or updates to the status. Just pure garbage, whoever is in charge of this whole operation needs to get fired."
"They don't update their tracking system until hours after the package leaves one location. Holds packages at some of their locations for over a day. Constantly pushing back the delivery day and time. Was told that my package was supposed to arrive on Wednesday 1/52022 by 9pm. Waited all day for it., only for it to not show up. Pushed the delivery date to yesterday by 9pm. Once again no package. Once again Pushed back the delivery date to today by 9pm and it's still sitting in Hazelwood MO, where it's been sitting for almost two days"
We are a company that has pickups scheduled but half the time they don’t stop. Yet they still charge us. We are also in an industrial area and they tack on rural delivery fees. They are constantly charging fees that are unnecessary. Wish there was another option. Ups management is horrible but the drivers are great
"Driver said I was not home/available and dropped my package off at pickup point, even though I was home all day waiting for the package."
Delayed pick up for 4 days!! I've been calling them everyday and they always promise to pick it up within the day. M-Th fee is 185 pesos and 297 pesos on weekends. They resched the pick up on Fri probably to get the higher price. They didn't inform me regarding the change in fees. They don't even issue receipt! How can I know if these fees are legit?! Very poor service. The driver keeps on asking for the directions despite of giving him the landmarks and exact location. What a toxic and unsatisfactory experience!! They don't even deserve a star for their service.
"We got a 3d printed prop and was sent it arrived fast but not intact. You can clearly see the box was treated like crap even with many FRAGILE stickers, they do not care about the package obviously. If I could rate it a zero I would. I would stick to USPS they treat there packages a lot better. Heck ask Amazon if they can ship it to you. If you can’t your better off driving to get the package yourself. Would not recommend this company. If dollar tree started a shipping company they would do better."
Really poor service. Two packages lost or stolen in just a few months. No follow up fro UPS and impossible to file a claim. FedEx and USPS from now on.
"Horrible experience!!! I have the UPS app so that I can get package updates and use the tracking tool so I know where the truck is with my package in order to get a better idea of the time of delivery.
Package was scheduled to be delivered between 1-5pm 1/5/22. At 5:30pm I received an update saying the package would be delivered by 7pm. At 7:20pm I received another update saying the package would be to me by 9pm. At which time I decided to check the app to see where the truck was. The truck was in my neighborhood. At 8:30 no package so I went to the app again. The map showed the truck was out of my neighborhood and in another zip code.
At that point I called customer service. The woman I spoke to first tried telling me that my package wasn't on that truck. That it was more than likely on another truck and I would have my package by 9pm. I told her about the app and the mapping. She proceeded to tell me they have more than one truck and that just because a UPS truck was in my neighborhood doesn't mean my package was on that truck. I then asked her why in the world the app would track a truck that my package wasn't on? That made no sense. She then asked me to hold. When she came back she told me they just updated the delivery and my package would be delivered by 11:59pm. I said, ""Let me get this straight. You're telling me that my package will be here by 11:59pm? I'll have my package tonight?""
She said, ""Yes!"" I told her that didn't sound right because UPS doesn't deliver my neighborhood that late and the truck is heading away from me, now two zip codes away. But whatever.
After we hung up, I checked the map again to find the map was no longer available.
At 10:10 I received an email telling me my package was delayed because of adverse weather conditions. Made no sense because it was cold but in the 40's and the truck was in my neighborhood. Just one block over.
I waited till this morning (1/6/22) to give customer service a call. This time I was told my package was being held due to adverse weather conditions.
Well that was weird considering today was a high of 44, sunny and the roads were clear. When I explained this to the operator, she put me on hold to call the customer hub where my package is. When she came back she told me that the manager from that gun would call me back i. About 15 mins. This was at 11:30am. I waited till noon to find out they close at noon and then reopen at 5pm.
Needless to say, I never received that call back.
I waited till 5pm to call customer service (they wouldn't give me the number to the hub) to find out what was going on and why there have been no package updates since 10:10pm the day before. Again I was told my package was being held due to adverse weather conditions and that they will deliver it 1/7/22. The problem with that is we are expecting a snow storm starting tonight at 10pm till 5am. If UPS can't deliver a package because of adverse weather conditions when it's 44 and sunny, there's no way they are going to deliver immediately following a snow storm. But again, the operator assured me that 1) Someone from the customer hub will call me with in the hour and 2) my package will be delivered tomorrow. When I asked if I could just go pick up my package tonight, I was then told I can't pick up till tomorrow and that it would cost me to pick it up. Which I find ridiculous when UPS refuses to deliver the package to begin with. It really sucks that your company treats customers this way."
"This is ridiculous.. No communication asked for supervisor, Jenny from the Philippines said couldn't do that promised I would receive my package today..
Tried to explain after 3 days and numerous phone calls to the 800 number that will not let you get to a agent without repeating your tracking number 5 times.
One agent said he would put in a request to redeliver the next day..the other agent said they had the wrong address, another agent said she would request a supervisor from the local office call me..which I never received!!! Just a week before they delivered someone else's packages to me with an address that is 5 miles away..they finally picked them up 5 days later.
Not sure what is happening with the local UPS drivers...they just delivered a package 2 days ago to me from a different company. They left it outside my door which they always do...I have never had a problem before.. They have delivered these subscription boxes ( Be Kind from Ellen) to me 7 times!!!
Very confused on what is happening!!!"
horrible customer service delayed 3 times can't get a exact place on my package. the weight is completely wrong I just hope its the right one when it comes in 2 weeks later
"I am very depressed about the poor service in UPS delivery from three aspects

1st: unreliable
My package was supposed to be delivered on December 17th, but the driver delivered my package to the wrong address and the wrong person called Danny.

2nd: Irresponsible
The customer line, which is 1(800)742-5877, is the Christmas holiday it looks like take forever, I called from December 24-28 and January 1-3 are close and unable to take my call.

3rd: incapable
As December 26th I called the critical line of UPS and know my package was still unfound and will close the file the next day. But after a week, I still did not receive any updates from phone call or email regarding my package. As December 29th, I called your office again, and the girl said in her system, showed that the investigation is closed and will contact me tomorrow. But still, I did not receive anything.

This make me believe your investigation team does not put effort to find my package and trying to use an “investigation” as an excuse to not allow me to claim the compensation.

The driver is supposed to have every information and remember which building and person they hand in the package, the investigation should not be that complicated unless the driver is an irresponsible worker.

8 business investigation days is due. And still no one contacted me and give me an answer for found or claim.

Would you please improve your customer services and take action and reasonable compensation for your customer's loss due to your mistake?"
"Was getting a package delivered to my PO Box which is no problem for other carriers, note said there were problems attempting my delivery. I called the post office and spoke with the post master, ups had been there and left but no package was delivered for me, and in a town of less than 1000 people the postmaster knows me. I tried calling the customer service number and wound up fighting to try and get to speak with a person (which never happened) because the automated system said I didn't need to talk with a representative about my issue.

Horrible customer service and an even worse automated system."
"Paid for overnight and never arrived. Impossible to talk to someone over in customer service. When you find a real human behind the phone, they’re completely unhelpful."
ups lost my check and they scan my package claiming they can't find it now do my own investigation to find my check... don't ever use UPS the customer service sucks
"Very poor service and performance. My package as arrived in Cancun from overseas more than 24 hours ago - and still no delivery, not even an estimate or a new scan of the package for the last 12 hours. I am leaving Cancun tonight - most likely without the much needed contents…"
Very unsatisfied with the service. I called many times to ask for my package every agent I talked to will say the package is being process and I will be getting it today.. then I don’t receive it and I will be calling again and same thing they will say.. for a week that they did that to me. Very disappointed with their service it is like they don’t know what they are doing.
"Poor service. Waited in for a scheduled delivery and at the last minute ping, a mail to say ""Sorry dude, now it's tomorrow""

Use DPD."
"I was not aware that I would have to present to obtain my package. I ordered an Apple Pencil off of The Apple Store right after Christmas, and last year when I ordered AirPods from there, I DID NOT have to sign or be present when the package was delivered, so I figured that everything would be fine this time around. I also figured that they would let me know that I would be needed to be present to pick up the package via tracking information or e-mail.

Nope, I was wrong.

At approximately 2 PM yesterday, the delivery driver arrived at my home, and my dog started going crazy. Still under the impression that the package didn't require a signature, I watched as the delivery driver came up to the porch, and he ended up just standing there for a few seconds while my dog barked at him while standing next to the door. He didn't even knock at all! I get not wanting to further aggravate my dog, but come on, knocking means that you need me to come to the door!

I noticed that he was taking a long time just to simply drop the package on the porch, and by the time that I noticed this, he was already heading back towards the truck with my package in his hand. He left a note on the door saying that I could sign the back of it and authorize the package being left without me being present, so fingers crossed that a delivery driver doesn't walk off with my package again today.

TL;DR- I wasn't aware that I would need a signature for my package because it wasn't communicated to me whatsoever, and this is the first time that I've EVER had to sign for a package, let alone through The Apple Store because I had made a prior purchase that didn't require a signature, so I thought that I wouldn't need to sign."
If I could give them a 0 I would! I ordered a packaged paid extra for shipping to make sure I got it before Xmas. Ordered Dec 9 2021. They made 4 attempts to deliver before Xmas. I called and wondered why it had yet to be delivered. Every time the customer service rep said you need a number or code to get in. Everytime no I don't it's a house. So in speaking with the lady on the 24th and frustrated as I wouldnt have yhe package I paid extra for to get here in time. I told her I wanted to pick it up in Edmonton as I would be there for the hoilday. But this women took it upon herself to send it back out for delivery without my consent. Then when I told her to change it as I didn't request that and wanted to pick it up Wednesday when they opened she said it was done and couldnt be changed. I've had to attempted to be delivered 2 times again and yhe same thing even with apparent notes on the account. I even left my number if the driver didn't want to come out of his truck. As I was home all day on the 4th and said it would be delivered so i kept an eye out all day. Then when I seen the report and reasoning there wasn't even tracks in yhe snow that they had showed up. The driver now says the highways were closed. No they weren't it's winter driving. If they don't feel comfortable driving the highway I winter maybe they shouldn't be a delivery driver!! So now I have to continue to wait for a package and they have no idea when I'll get it. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN USE UPS THIS IS THE QORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD! They should be embarrassed at how dysfunctional and just how moronic their call centre and driver is. Just so fed up!!
"I had an vaccum delivery wich arrived earlier then we expected. They ringed our door bell twice and I answer hello who is this, with no one answering. I asked couple of times who is this but no one spoke so therefore I didn't open the door. They went back with our vaccum, they could've just answered delivery service. I do not understand how they expect us to open the door without knowing who is outside, unless they are mute and couldnt speak. I personally think they can speak up and say ""It's your delivery"" which would've saved us an ordeal plus the charge on our phone to call their service center which cost as expensive as the parking fee here in netherland."
Originally my order was expected on a certain day then it got changed to a day earlier which was good for me considering as this was over the New Year Bank Holiday. The only thing was it was an hour later then quoted. But driver very friendly
"Dreadful experience, packages don't arrive when they say they will. They change the dates of arrival randomly and without previous notice, customer service say the cannot do anything to help or speed things up. Tracking is just odd, this logistics provider isn't trustworthy I will never use them if I can avoid it. Because some businesses use them as the only shipping method, but they are just bloody awful."
Dreadful customer service. UPS kept changing the delivery date and time for my delivery. I tried talking to their customer service department but the staff member I spoke to could hardly speak English.
"Was waiting for a package I ordered from Ebay. On 01/03/22, I had received an email saying that it was delivered that day providing a UPS tracking number.
Well, the item did not arrive, so I checked the tracking number on UPS's website. It stated that the package was delivered that day. The next day, while at work I checked with UPS again. Now that tracking number claims that the package was delivered 12/10/21, a whole 3 days before it actually shipped."
"UPS used to be good but now they are worse than USPS. That's pretty bad in my eyes. They are never on time and when the package gets to you it looks like they went bowling with it. I have been dealing with this for some time now and held my self back from leaving this review, hoping it would get better but it is only getting worse."
Worst experience with package delivery service ever. When contacting their service line they asked me to come to their office in person to pick the parcel up because they can't figure out why my parcel is not being delivered. The reason stated in the app is an error in the address (the address is correct). Parcel is withheld since 2 weeks.
"Absolutely useless. They've just missed a four hour slot and rescheduled for 'end of day' (it's 13:46 now.) Can't get any useful information online to know why they've rescheduled.
When DPD say they will deliver in their *one* hour slot they do - always."
"Appalling service.

I have booked online a collection service. The driver shows up outside the allocated timeslot and despite confirmation from the customer service team, he fails to return. My collection was delayed for up to a week and upon return, the driver somehow manages to lose all 3 commercial invoices which I have hand-delivered to him. The agents on the phone for the most part are completely and utterly useless. I have wasted over an hour on the phone with no avail to be ping-ponged from one agent to the other or to be placed on an endless loop of 'hold'.

Overall, the whole experience and service were disgusting, completely apathetic, and screamed incompetence. Definitely to avoid in the future!"
"Very poor service. They are most callous people I have ever seen.
One of my important package was thrown by them somewhere and claimed delivered . Their associates back in india refused to give back the claim. Pathetic. I urge never to use Ups."
"AWFUL COMPANY!!!!
I was expecting a package from Spain. It never showed up. I got not email or anything telling me estimated delivery date/time. Apparent driver tried delivering 3 times! Rubbish!! Now the package is back in Spain and UPS are forcing me to pay £70!!! What a scam!!!"
UPS continues to disappoint. I trust them as does my pharmacy with medication delivery and to see something showing out for delivery all day and then at the last minute change to tomorrow delivery or worse yet being dropped off at the local Michael’s is crazy. I’ve paid many times to upgrade to a verified delivery window and 9 out of 10 times they never make it. Their app and website shows different information consistently and none of it is accurate according to the customer service agents you speak to. I have 11 case numbers open for issues ranging from packages being tossed over a wall into the pool to them left on the street corner for anyone to pick up. Not one single response. Not sure what’s going on at UPS but at this rate they will be out of business before you know it.
Customer service employee#qzz1vdc is the biggest Liar. Complains will be sent in writting. The worst customer service supervisor to talk to.
"I ordered a Christmas gift on Amazon that was supposed to be delivered on the 27th of December via ups surepost. Then I was informed the gift wouldn’t arrive until the 30th of December. The 30th came & went without the gift. Now mind you I received all my other gifts a few days before Christmas except this one. Now, I’ve been informed it will arrive today, but tracking says it’s been transferred to another carrier & hasn’t gone out to me, the customer. This is a joke! I can’t believe shipping companies can do business this way. I will never order from any company that uses UPS surepost. I hope I get the gift before next year. Grr!"
UPS is a complete joke… been waiting on a package for 2 weeks that UPS said their delivering which they never have…don’t ever use them. Use FedEx you’ll get better customer service and your packages will arrive…. God knows what ups did with my package..
"Terrible terrible service and communication to customer.
Parcel was supposed to be delivered Thursday four days later still waiting.
Claim they called no record of that at all
Just a note on the door.When a customer gives you instructions for delivery follow them. I would not use your service or recommend you at all!!!
Had a delivery from Amazon missed his call.Called them right back and the guy came back.This is CUSTOMER SERVICE learn it educate your employs to use it."
Terrible this drivers been going back in forth past my house with my stuff an was sittin in one place for about an hour just terrible
"Package was scheduled to be delivered initially on Fri Dec 31st... after the first day they changed the status to ""Due to Operating Conditions, Your Package May Be Delayed"", whatever that means. Then on Friday Dec 31st early morning the package arrived at our local UPS warehouse. Only to find out they were not delivery packages on new year eve and would not continue to delivery of packages until Monday Jan 3rd. They updated my package with estimate delivery to be Tues Jan 4th on that Friday. Come Monday the 3rd they delayed my package again until Wen Jan 5. My package went from a Fri Dec 31st delivery date to Tue Jan 4 and then finally a Jan 5th date... Assuming they don't delay the package again.

This whole time amazon and usps are still delivery packages. I'll have to consider where I buy stuff from going forward if they are going to use UPS for shipping. If I would have know when I purchased that this would take 7 plus days to arrive I would have used amazon or local pickup from another retailer.

Very sad when a package is like 10 miles way for nearly 5 days before you can receive it."
I had a trumpet delivered today in a soaking wet falling apart box. Come on y’all can do better. This is ridiculous and it’s a wonder the trumpet and case wasn’t ruined. What did y’all do leave the box outside all weekend?
"Sent package to France. UPS lose it.
Buyer paid 47 Euros in customs fees. They refuse to refund her. Say she has to apply for a refund to customs, but won't say how. She doesn't know how.
She paid UPS these fees. How is it they just absolve themselves of responsibility.
This is a huge loss to me as a small business if I have to personally refund her customs fees which were never paid to me. They are a disgrace. And haven't come back to me on my claim either.
I will NEVER use UPS again and I hope others don't either."
"UPS staff called Simon who sits at the Siginon office warehouse asking for BRIBES to release goods.

Once my goods arrived in Kenya, I was requested to pay an uplift of about $120. I tried to negotiate with them as these were my goods which I was using when studying in Marbella, Spain. The UPS representative asked me to go to the office and communicate with them. I couldn't do this during that time as I was tested positive with COVID. Once I tested negative again, I managed to go to their offices and sort my issue out with the customs team. They did allow me to reduce the amount and I sorted it out. When I was trying to sort my issue out with the customs, this man called Simon was talking to people at the customs and telling them that my goods have an issue, despite them accepting that my goods can be cleared. He really kept insisting that the goods have an issue and he called one of the customs people to convince them to not clear the goods. He was told that what he is doing is wrong and that they cannot harass me like that. So the customs team helped me clear my goods.

Thereafter, he kept insisting that I have to pay for the storage fees. I asked him to kindly reduce the fees as I couldn't make it to the office because I was tested positive and I did not want to infect anyone else. I was under isolation. He kept insisting and asking me to give him a bribe so he could reduce the storage fees and help me out. He really wanted me to bribe him with almost around $100 so that he could help remove my goods from the warehouse without paying the storage fees."
"Horrible!!!!!! pkg sent from east coast to west coast. Got email from UPS my pkg would be delivered next. Next day came and went and no pkg. I opened a claim the next and it has been 2 1/2 weeks and they cannot find the pkg. When I have spoken with UPS on the they tell me have the seller send another (was 1 of a kind) or just get your money back. I think of UPS as liars and thieves. I do not think they even do a search, they do not care!!!"
"My brother in the US paid UPS over $50USD to ship a gift to me in Canada. The gift itself was worth $59USD, so we joked he was paying almost as much to ship the gift as the gift was worth. Then I received a call from UPS saying I owed on my end almost $30 for an international shipping fee...and I can't get my gift parcel unless I pay it. We will never ever use UPS to ship a parcel again. Grrrr!"
"waited too long 10 day more delay why SHENZHEN CHINA AIRPORT Freighter Closed (UPS Hub to Europe ALL NO-Flight vacation) !

Flightradar24 currently live today SHENZHEN CHINA AIRPORT UPS NO-FLY ????"
"The worst package delivery experience. It was probably the most complicated and worst experience for package delivery. The updates on the UPS page does not match the current status. They delivered at a date and put the update for delivery date and time like 2 after it actually happened. No notice was left, even though they mentioned that they left one. They decided to return the package to the sender. I could catch it back and arrange a delivery retry. I was told to receive it on friday between 9-13 and I waited, but noone came, not on monday. Finally they delivered on tuesday at 15:30!!! I had even to pay extra for this delivery service. I had to make >5calls with >60 in total with people who were really trieing to help me, but it was more a try to make me happy instead of really helping.

UPS Never again!!!"
"I'd give a zero if I could.

I've been going to UPS #6134 location for over 10 years to do my business.

December 28, 2021 was the first time I've been extremely disappointed and assaulted by one of the representatives.

I came in and the young lady began helping me immediately. She already pulled the AT&T modem out of box to input the number to create paperwork. A customer who came in right behind me began asking her questions. The representative stopped helping me and began helping this other customer. After the the customer left I said to the young lady I'd like to make a suggestion that when she's helping one customer she shoud tell the next customer she would be right with them.

Instead of apologizing to me she tried to justify her actions by stating customer was already there. I clearly had to state the customer came in behind me. She tried to further justify herself by asking another representatives to vouch for her. Only when I was adamant did the young lady state she was helping her previously and she had left but came back in with another question. I asked for an apology and she refused. She then ask the other representative to assist me in which I replied yes, I think that's a good idea to work with someone with some respect.

The young lady smarts off about her being Hispanic. I quickly replied it has nothing to do with Hispanic and that was her issue and on her.

The other representative helped and as im leaving said have a good day. I returned the comment by saying you too.

The young lady that quit helping me was assisting another customer and just had to get a jab in as I was leaving the store. She hollered I hope you have a better day. At which I replied, I already am.

All the young lady had to do was apologize or even say to me do you mind if I assist her, she was her earlier.

She's turned into a racist issue and I'm still trying to figure out how she even escalated it to there. If anything, this was a racist attack on me, a middle aged white woman. The young lady invited me to the counter to help me. This wouldn't be an issue if she wouldn't have hollered out as I was leaving the store. What makes the matter worst is I believe she was talking to the store manager about the incident but the manager never came out to ask me about it.

I pass at least 2 other locations that can handle the same services, but I have always chosen this store until today. This young lady needs a serious reprimand if not something more severe.

Everyone is is entitled to a bad day but it's how you handled it that makes the difference."
UPS was good with communication and updated me regularly through the Christmas holiday. The parcel was delivered ahead of the first notified date. I was pleased. My local UPS man is very pleasant and courteous. I would use UPS when sending.
"I would highly recommend that you do not deal with a company that does business like this. Complete lies and inability to deliver!
Use FedEx, they will at least make an effort!
FedEx priority international or FedEx priority domestic if time is of the essence.They have always delivered when they said they would. UPS total thumbs down!"
Ducking bad ups dont ever try to use ups
"I can not log in to my account, can not make the payment. The worst site ever"
"UPS Is probably the worst carrier I swear to God! The fact that order something and pay for expedited shipping on top of that and still your package and let and false tracking information! Package says left on front porch, I’ve been home all day let alone have a camera outside on the porch! They really need to shut down and let FedEx keep their job! UPS SUCKS!"
i hate ups they said they came to my door and tried to leave my package and they didn’t so now i have to wait 3 extra days because of this dumbass that said he “tried” to knock on the door.
Worst customer service. They take forever to answer and then half the time you can’t even understand what they’re saying.
The customer service lied to me twice. Super visit lied to me. Could not understand customer service to begin with. My son's Christmas gift never showed up thanks to poor customer service and drivers that don't check their customers ups my choice requests. I refuse to ever use this company in the future. I hope everyone else does to. Get better or be gone.
"Why?! Oh why can I not leave a negative review? UPS deservers minus 5 stars. Worst service ever. They keep updating their ETA, and every time the date gets further and further away. My package was estimated to arrive on the 29 Dec 2021, then the date was changed to 30. It's the 31st today and now the ETA is 4 Jan 2022. I mean what the actual F%$#... I've seen weed dealers more punctual than this crappy company..."
"They suck! They will leave notes on the door for packages that need signatures (without giving any additional info like who the package is from or tracking number) and the only way to get the package yourself, if you won’t be home, is by paying $7.99."
"They do not allow their drivers to carry phones. I live on the second floor of a secure apartment without any kind of buzzer at the entrance, so they have no way of letting me know they have arrived with the package. So I have to use their estimated delivery time (which is always wrong) and meet them at the door.

I will never use UPS again, even if it costs me more to go through Amazon or other services. Either allow your drivers to carry a phone so they can call me, or make absolute certain that the estimated time of delivery is 100% accurate."
"Awful service. I have a sign on my door. it says ""Please Ring Bell"" yet I find notes from UPS stuck almost on top of my sign saying ""Sorry we missed you"" Twice in a row? Why!! Now I have to drive out to one of their stores to pick up this parcel. This happened so many times over the years that I stopped dealing with UPS but some of my suppliers still ship through them. Not sure why these goofs are still in business. Avoid them if you have a choice."
"I wish I can give zero stars if possible. Never ever get anything shipped by this company. Do anything you can to avoid business with UPS. Three times they deliver to me during the workday when nobody is home. What makes them think that coming at the same time the next weekday, will make a difference. Driver blatantly ignored my written notes. Asked my neighbor who lives on the second floor to sign for me, but the driver was very hostile according to her. She asked to sign for my package and the driver said ""are you him?"" then proceed to rip the package away from her and left. This is over a computer mouse by the way. But for some reason they treating it like they're delivering a nuclear weapon or something. So now I have to drive 30 minutes to pick it up even though I paid shipping and service fees which apparently they can't refund. Overall, this company is behind in their times, and are uncapable of giving good service. If I had to, I would compare this company to just garbage. Or not even any garbage."
"They steal money with their ""SERVICE"". The customer centre is made of a bunch of idio_ts that just seem analfabets and have no intention to help. After 5 calls that served nothing but waste my time, I contacted them with emails, and after 30 emails I still have to obtain a reimbursement for a service not done. Unbelievable."
"Horrible customer service experience at the UPS store in Okatie SC. Had 2 UPS packages delivered to my house addressed to person that no longer lived at the address. I tried to return the packages to the UPS store to be sent back. They refused the packages. I commented that I might as well throw them away, the female behind the counter pointed to the trash can. Absolutely horrible customer service."
The whole user experience on their site is terrible. So frustrating and all I wanted was to change the delivery address. - Should be the easiest thing to do. I gave up and called customer service instead.
Take time off to meet their time slot and they deliver early without any notification.
"A text message said that they had been by my house to deliver but that I was not at home. I was home all day!
They said they had delivered at a pickup point. The pickup point did not have the parcel.
Lost."
"UPS is the worst shipping company ever
UPS is the worst shipping company ever, I shall never use them again. Their Customer service is absolutely garbage too.
I sent a parcel on 20th December with portable solar panels and solar lights a small lenovo x250 laptop, powerbanks and some chocolate sweets for typhoon victims in the Philippines that have been left with no power, water, or phone signals and a lot of devastation. I used UPS 5 day expediated service. it Took 3 days just to leave the UK at Donnington, and only left after I chased up why it was taking so long. I was promised a call back from someone who could provide a reason for this delay and never got it. It then got stuck in china for 3 days according to the tracking site. and Finally reached Pampanga in Philippines so I thought it was finally getting there. Then the very next update is it is in Shenzhen china so I phoned again. At first they tried to blame the typhoon for the delivery delays, I just said the typhoon did not affect UK or China that I know of, I was promised someone would call me back yesterday by 8pm after they have checked whats has happened. Yet again no-one did. Now today the tracking site is reporting its in China with a Mechanical failure, I am absolutely disgusted by the Service provided by UPS especially with their Customer Service who just Fob you off and blatently lie and make any excuses they can come up with.
If Mechanical failure means the box is now Damaged It is UPS fault, The Box should of been there in 5 days not bounced round the UPS warehouses for 10 days to get just half way. it was a good strong cardboard box and very well sealed.
One last thing, When the tracking site says they will contact the sender or receiver, That is a Joke, and another piece of their foboff, they do not contact either the sender or receiver and the parcel starts moving again with a new status they have got the information required.
Just so you can all see I will paste the tracking below.

UK Standard Airmail cannot be any worse than UPS Expediated services.
I will never use UPS expediated services again this cost £65 to send such a small box,
I only paid for this service as I was trying to help Typhoon victims out as quickly as possible.

And Dont you just Love the automated responses below these reviews to send them an email, I wont bother because they will just get ignored too.

"Ups did not deliver on time…once again. They actually stated on my account that I re-scheduled delivery ..just a load of lies. Why can’t they just be honest??
1Z4147R36811690520"
If I could leave no stars I would. Called to see where my package was after it was an hour late. They told me to give it one more hour due to high deliveries volume. No big deal. Hour goes by and they change it to tomorrow because they were done delivering for the day. Very disappointed
"Was told that it was going to take eight days for investigation called back after 10 days they’re starting a new claim said that the driver hast to go to the warehouse three times as part of the investigation paid for an item paid for premium delivery I was home when they said the package was supposed to have been delivered no package. Called ups immediately to say that the package was not at the house and they suggested we look around the property for the package!!!! However tracking said that the package was left at the front door, there was no package. Was told the other day that the claim was complete and that UPS was notifying the shipper called back two days later and UPS said they have to start a new claim"
"Could not ask for better customer service! The UPS store in Springfield, Ohio is outstanding. The employees are professional and very friendly and courteous. When they pack and send my items, it is very well done and nothing ever was delivered broken or damaged. I send nearly all of my packages via UPS and am totally satisfied."
"Horrible business. Was on a phone with an agent named Jose who would not help address my concerns, nor was the agent friendly. I asked the agent to transfer me to his supervisor, so he asked me for my phone number as well as my first and last name and then put me on hold. I was on hold for over 30 minutes at which point I decided to hang up. I had low expectations for the ups before, but now they have lowered the bar even lower."
"I've rarely seen such a high amount of negative reviews for any business, but I'm really not surprised, given the sheer amount of terrible experiences I've had with them over the years. I don't even know where to begin or which of those experiences to relay here, but if this give you an idea, it's come to the point where I typically will completely NOT purchase from any business that relies on UPS for delivery. It's that bad."
"Similar to what was posted before, if I could give 0 stars I would. This is perhaps the laziest package company to exist! They hire incompetent drivers that deliver to not just the wrong address that is given but the wrong CITY. Then in order to file a claim you must make an account before being told ""that number is with another section that you have to file a claim with."" So I attempt that and instead now I need to print a pdf and mail it instead of before where I could file online? Then if you call their number NONE of their operators are working and the automated support system is absolutely atrocious. They don't WANT to work, you can tell that clearly. Never, if I can help it, will I EVER use UPS again. The worst of the bunch."
"I wish giving 0 stars was an option. This is absolutely the WORST shipping company I have ever had to use. My item was suppose to be delivered dec 22 and every day they have come up with a different excuse for a delay. Suppose to be delivered today, there has been no update from “delayed” once again. Unreal that companies still use this crap company!!"
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Let me just start off buy saying the reps are liars! My package was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I called 3 times for updates because I'm traveling tomorrow and need my package. All of their reps lied and advised me that they were tracking the package and could see that it would still be delivered. It NEVER came. The tracking info online updated to a new estimated delivery date, today. I checked it this morning, it isn't even out for delivery. So I called to see if I can pick it up. Someone from UPS calls me back and notified me that they don't know where my package is and that I would have to contact the sender to file a claim."
"Lost/Stolen Christmas Package and Terrible Customer Support

My husband and I are very disappointed to learn that a Christmas package that we paid to overnight to my father in Utah had been “lost.”
We paid $140 to overnight a package to my father in Utah who waited all day for a delivery that didn’t happen. I spoke to a UPS customer representative to reschedule a delivery by phone after tracking updates online showed an invoice number was left to reference our package that had apparently been placed on “Hold for Pickup Request”, which is interesting because, my father confirmed that he was home and that there was no memo nor receipt (not even a single knock at the door) to confirm a delivery attempt was even made by UPS. I periodically checked for tracking updates throughout the day and noticed that the status hasn’t changed since I was instructed to input this non existent invoice number that was required on UPS’s website to try to schedule a delivery before having to call customer support a third time.
I called once again to check for any updates since it was nearing the end of day for UPS to supposedly deliver. It was then that my husband and I learned that my father’s package was “Lost” and an investigation for the lost package will take eight business days to investigate. Furthermore, we’ll need to contact the UPS store that shipped our package for future updates on the investigation. It’s been very frustrating, to say the least that every UPS representative I have spoken to so far is completely unapologetic and unhelpful from the moment I called to ask about a “request for pickup” memo that was NEVER left by the UPS driver. I feel like I just got a complete runaround by every customer service representative, except for one that helped to reschedule an actual delivery attempt – that still never took place.
After all of this, I was told that a supervisor will respond by reaching out to us by phone this morning at 9 AM. It’s been a couple hours later and we have yet to hear back from anyone…"
Absolutely dismal service. Paid premium delivery service to ensure isolation gift arrived pre Christmas. It’s now 29 December and still no sign. Recipient is now out of isolation and flying home today. Having to reroute parcel to sender and not entitled to refund cos that’s our choice. It’s the only option we have cos the recipient has left her isolation country! Just appalling.
"They left me one of those ""we missed you"" notes. I call them to try to intercept it or pick it up somehow before the ""next business day"". The guy says it didn't require a signature so they shouldve left it at you door. Then he says they'll come back between 4 and 5 pm. they never do. I hope whoever talked to me on that phone gets cancer."
"You guys are possibly the worst shipping service I’ve had to deal with, my estimated dates Are inaccurate by weeks, my package ( for the 3rd time) was suppose to be here 2 weeks ago. I track it, it is here in my home town… doesn’t show up. Look again and it’s on its way backwards!!"
"UPS stands for Usual Poor Service. this carrier sucks.
package notice ""Out For Delivery "" ( loaded on truck ) gets changed 4 hours later to new "" Delivery Date Changed"" to later date, with NO guarentee of delivery on the new date later in week. arranged to take off from work to wait on package on original date ( and lose money ) and piece of crap UPS cannot deliver. Trustpilot does not allow no stars on a review so had to put one star, should be NO STARS."
"I got two almost similar issues with overnight deliveries. They do not deliver the package on time for the first case and required another delivery address for the second. That was a nightmare to talk to an agent with a blocking robot. When you get an agent, he/she only creates a ticket instead of resolving the problem which was very urgent. UPS doesn't resolve issues on time. BEWARE! I also had many issues with deliveries when I purchase certain items from Amazon.com. They reschedule deliveries on their own without asking me."
If another one of my packages come in ripped open y’all going to hear every last bit of me get ready or fix the damn problem my stuff shouldn’t be opened when delivered
"Total Christmas fail for UPS and UPS Store 1571 in Kingwood! We spent $58 for guaranteed delivery on Dec 23rd. The mailing address was stored in Store 1571's system, as we have send packages from there before. But UPS delivery claimed that no such address existed and returned the package to UPS Store 1571. Although the address turned out to be correct, the singularly defensive and unhelpful young man waiting on us said they would not re-send our package or refund our money. ""Call UPS. It's not our fault!"" I guess the UPS Store actually has no affiliation with UPS and takes no responsibility for their screw-ups. And so... (why am I not surprised?) UPS says it's not their policy to give a refund and wants me to talk to UPS Store 1571 about a refund. UPS Store 1571 said to talk to UPS. What a scam they have going! On my way to @FedEx to re-ship my package. Should have gone there first."
"Mailed a package to Detroit. I was told ground shipping was $58.34. Got home, discovered that ground residential was $34.34. UPS tacked on $24 for ''additional handling.'' Called UPS and was never told why the additional charge. Told to call back in a week. Got the run around. Put on hold. Cut off. Transferred. Last person told me it was because package was 51.15 pounds and any package over 50 pounds is charged $24. Shipping packages all over the country for more than 30 years, and never told that. I am still upset about UPS customer service."
"This Place is A joke .
Their customer service in India is A joke
Never Us Ups Again"
"Literally service is so slow, been waiting for my package, keeps getting delayed. Everytime it gets closer to its deliver day, it always pushes it back. Hurry the heck up come on."
"My issue with UPS is the 'mail innovations' option. I had a Christmas present sent to my Dad. He lives in a town with a small population. The package arrived at his post office on Dec 11th. UPS picked it up and it's now Dec 26th and he still hasn't received the package. They could have had my Dad pick up the package from the post office, but instead 'mail innovations' means it sits with UPS for who knows how long. 'Mail innovations' is the dumbest idea for shipping."
"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Customer service help non existent. You will not receive help, information or answers when they send you their generic emails detailing absolutely nothing, when you discover your shipment has just been dumped indefinitely at warehouse. Nightmare experience."
"Hi I would not give even a one star.
This is a fraud company.
In my case , after purchasing a second hand item on a marketplace, I had to pay an enormous Custom,
because UPS put a wrong number in a declaration.
And guess, to get it back YOU have to deal with all paper work with local custom services. Think twice before you chose it, you will it pay it triple."
"Just UPS Nigeria! Never use this service into Nigeria except if you are not a seriouse person.
You will regret it."
How Disgusting your company is. Have no sympathy that is Christmas and many pple are waiting on gifts. And the thing is they send you a notification saying package has been left at the front door and nothing was left. This was a gift to my mom in NY and you guys made this the most terrible Christmas ever!!!!
I only leave one star bc I do not see the option for 0 my package was clearly opened and retapped and 2 items stolen. I will never use UPS again!
Package not arriving on Christmas. Terrible service
UPS DRIVER OPENED PACKAGE TOOK ITEMS AND RETAPED BOX!!!!!!!!!!!
It's Christmas eve I was supposed to have a package delivered new phone. Of course they messed that up the package has been in Montgomery facility since last night. I'm done with company all together. Freaking horrible
Ruined Christmas. I had a fairly pricey package coming as a gift for Christmas and TWICE they claimed they couldn't deliver it. Now it's Christmas eve and my mom won't have a present because they can't follow simple instructions. I'm a small business owner and should have known better to trust them to deliver on time or follow instructions. I've had so many issues with them and I will not be using your service any longer. This was the final straw.
"3 shipments and no packages. I received notifications, walked around my apartment community and found it wasn’t delivered incorrectly. 3 packages. I contacted the vendors and let them know. I never use UPS for work and this solidifies I will never use them for anything. I didn’t have a choice but if I did, I wouldn’t have chosen them. Worse, can’t file a claim because it says I release them from any problems. So about $700 worth of stuff missing and will have to replaced by the vendors. And you wonder why the cost of goods are rising? Lousy delivery service doesn’t help."
Horrible its literally Christmas tomorrow and my package was so post be delivered to my home but instead they sent to a UPS store where it said for days and I didn't realize it until I start wrapping gifts that missing items and now I'm a day to late and they sent my package back but they delivered half a and now my kids won't have they Christmas present and their is nothing I can do and I won't be able to get those items.
"The company's name should be changed to Under Performing Services UPS. Every time they try to deliver they bring the package to a similar named address in another town? They just became worse then the Louis Dejoy pony express system, at least they learned from reviews? This company it is almost impossible to speak to a human being they should ask for reviews when they make a delivery and an independent company should compile this data for management to learn how the competition does it, before they run this company into the ground!"
"Trust Pilot really need to offer the option of no stars when you write a review, although to be fair, one of the staff members at UPS was eventually quick to reply to my mails, even though nothing was resolved. Long story short, my Christmas presents were due to be taken to South Africa by a friend but she was unable to fly at the last minute due to the UK'S travel red list. I sent my Christmas presents home via UPS with plenty of time to arrive before Christmas, but it's turned out that they will not arrive until (I don't know how long) after Christmas now. They have been in South Africa since the 17th, they said they had tried to contact the recipient (there was no contact/missed call), when I eventually got hold of someone in South Africa, they said there was an error on the invoice due to their ridiculous online form's miscalculation the £ value of the parcel, they needed an itemised list of contents, plus individual itemised costs (not asked for when booking the pickup) and when that list contained pet treats, they needed to involve the state vet to authorise, even though they are Pedigree products commercially available in SA. Obviously the state vet does not work at this time of year, except with a skeleton staff, so it hasn't happened. I asked them to remove the 4 small offending items from the parcel but they are unable to break up the parcel because the consignment is for one parcel, not many smaller ones. So. No Christmas presents for my family who I can't see due to covid travel restrictions and no idea when they will arrive. I'm gutted, as will my niece and nephew be, not to mention how furious I am that I paid a premium for expedited delivery... this is very far from that. I've sent stuff to South Africa before with other couriers and never experienced any of these problems... I specifically picked a courier with a recognised name instead of a no-name brand, and I'll not use them again. I'm so very angry and disappointed. :("
I dropped my package at UPS early at opening and was given a delivery date of 12/24. Which was delayed because someone at UPS messed up and did not scan my package in until the next day. It has been sent around the world by UPS just to be shipped 2 states away. It didn't leave my state for THREE DAYS. They do not offer local customer service it seems it's overseas and no one helps resolve any issues. Reps keep reciting what you've already seen online and can't give you direct answers. I will never use UPS ever again! They are absolutely the worst. No one at UPS resolves issues. Horrible company
"We had a problem with getting a package and it wasn't our fault. The package did turn up--it was delivered to the wrong address.

Yesterday a driver came to our home. She was very rude and aggressive. We had already notified LL Bean that the package was recovered, but we had not notified UPS.
The rude woman who came to our door was condescending and accusatory. It was NOT our fault that we did not have the package immediately--we are grateful that a neighbor was honest and left it by our door, albeit late. The driver was in our face and NOT wearing a mask. We are elderly and are very careful about Covid.
Because of this incident, we will request ALL of our packages are shipped by FedEx or USPS. We have also spoken with our neighbors.
Furthermore, my husband will cancel his business shipping agreement with UPS. This is a horrible way to conduct business."
"This is the worst courier i have ever experience. They came to deliver and i was next to my home and they didn’t call and leave. Next day i was flying out of country and i was begging them to call the courier to tell me what time he might come and they couldn't even have the interest to tell me the last delivery hour. I ask them what should i do, should i change my flight just to receive the package and they told me that this is my own problem. Such an unprofessional company and they don’t care about their clients at all. I called twice having the hope that it was the first customer service girl rude but at my surprise it was the same and worst at the second call. They are awful and the worst courier in Greece. Their services are extremely expensive but their can’t deliver what the company promises. Dhl and Aramex never let me down."
"Woeful experience with UPS. I expected a company of this size to be able to deliver 2 parcels. How wrong I was!! I would give zero stars if I could.

Parcel 1: Delivery driver came to my door and demanded cash then ran off not giving me a reciept or anything. I rang up the customer service department and was told an invoice would be sent to me saying that I had paid it in full. They sent me 1 with an unpaid flag, then one for the wrong amount paid and then another with the full amount still to be paid. I also had emails off several departments asking about this.

Parcel 2: When dealing with the first parcel I paid for the second at the same time thinking that would make things easier. NOPE! they are still sending me invoices in the post asking for random bits of money that I dont owe!!! When contacting the customer service team for the 7th time I was on hold for 40 minutes to then be told to ring back tomorrow as the person couldn't email the billing department!!

All companies should avoid UPS and just use DHL or anyone else for their courier services."
"It is shocking that companies like this still exist when they are so incompetent - ordered an item on 13th December.

Received notification it would be delivered to my home address for 3 days in a row - never came. Called each day, told it was arriving the next.

Changed delivery to a local depot rather than home as one of the customer team said that would be quicker. Then got told it was being sent back to the sender as the parcel had been refused which was just not true as had never received it.

23 December get a notification it is now at my delivery office and signed for. Drive 30mins there to find it is not there, and the person 'Gabe' who signed for it does not work there and they do not know who he/she is. The pick up location said none of the UPS drivers know what they are doing and they have constant issues.

Call UPS - spend 1 hour on phone on Christmas Eve - they say it is back with the sender, there is nothing they can do, I need to speak to the sender and re-order it.

Result = no Christmas present which I had specially bought, multiple hours of my time wasted, and still UPS taking no responsibility.

Would avoid at all costs."
"It’s always a pleasure to receive deliveries from UPS as my delivery man is so polite and friendly and asks me where I want the parcel placed. It arrived sooner than I expected, so that was a bonus."
"Wish I could write negative review
french UPS useless , dishonnest same goes with Istanbul and forget customer service ... incompetent and could not care less.. no manager .. I wonder!"
"I do not understand how companies with such a terrible reputation stay in business?

Paid extra to be delivered before Xmas and received an email and SMS informing me that my shipment would be delivered on 22.12.

On the 22nd i received another email informing me that it would be delivered on 23rd.

On the 23rd i received another email informing me that it would be delivered on 24th.

No matter how many times i check the tracking code, the status is always ""On the Way"" as oppose to ""Out for deliver"".

If you call UPS you cannot get through to anyone.

Useless company.

Update to review: surprise surprise, i received another email on Xmas eve morning informing me that the delivery date has been changed yet again. This time to 29.12.

Further update to review (10.01.22): The status now says delivered to the customer despite absolutely nothing being delivered! #thieves"
"I recently bought a new item from amazon for Xmas, and when the item was delivered it looked like someone had opened it the box was all ripped on sides and looked like it was smashed. It is for Xmas so I have to wait but Im actually hoping it isnt actually broke it was not in any way taken care of or handled with some decent amount of care for peoples stuff. This isnt the first time people are complaining when will you actually hire decent drivers."
"Delivery was fast and reliable, but I wasn't notified of the domestic carrier's tracking number."
"I paid extra to have a purse delivered for my mother for Christmas. Tracked the package, it said the bag was delivered. I did not receive the purse. Customer Service stated I would need to submit a claim and it will take 2-4 business days for a investigation. I was really sad as I wanted to surprise my mom and there was no empathy nothing. I literally watched the window waiting for this package as I could finally get her a gift for Christmas and UPS let me down. If you can avoid UPS do so.."
I paid extra to have shoes delivered for my grandson for Christmas. Tracked the package it said the shoes were delivered. I did not receive the shoes but did get a package for a neighbor that lives a block away. That is why I deal with Amazon. At least they take pictures of their deliveries. Then they had the audacity to tell I had to wait at least 8 business days for a investigation. Horrible service.
"I have a gift arrived from overseas in KY and now after 2 weeks, it is still being held in a warehouse there pending customs clearance. When I called UPS, the carrier that my friend used to send this gift to me, they said that they will contact the customs to inquire why it has not been cleared. But until now I have not heard anything back despite my repeated calls. DON'T EVER USE UPS TO SEND YOUR PACKAGES!!!"
"This is the second time in a month UPS has failed completely! The first time I ordered a cell modem from Mississippi to Florida overnight and it arrived 5 days later. All you get is non-English speaking customer service and they just read what is on the screen. The second order was shipped 2 day air and they said they delivered the item but no UPS truck even drove on my street ( 3 hi-rez security cameras) and I called the offshore customer service and they said it would be looked into the next day. Also they confirmed my phone number and sail I would be called between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM by the local manager. No call all day and I called back to the customer support and they said I would be called tomorrow. I am not holding my breath! No Christmas presents for some as UPS has outdone the Grinch!
As a union shop how can they allow offshore call centers that are non-union. The workers have very low pay and no benefits. I have a new policy ""If the call center in not in the US I will not do business with them!!!"" This needs a hash tag like
#noUS-Nobuy USPS is doing a better job!"
Wish I could give it a zero!!! Sitting by waiting for packages. Amazon and USPS I met and received. Some reason both UPS packages I missed. On the same day and time frame 😡
"You have to be a complete idiot to deliver a package on its side when it clearly states on the box "" this side up "".
If you can drive a damn truck I'm sure you can read."
"I ordered cards from Zazzle that were shipped on December 14. They were going from Kansas City to
Minneapolis with expected delivery by the 17th. Ups took the package which first went from Kansas to California, then to Texas and finally got to Minneapolis on December 19th. Since then, it has been sitting in the UPS partner shipping facility in Brooklyn Park ,MN. They will not give out the address, I'm sure for fear of being stormed by angry customers. My post office said thing can sit there for weeks before they make it to the post office to be delivered. Zazzle is sending a new order (overnight with Fedex) because my order is now ""lost"". It's lost because it went with UPS, the most incompetent shipper in the country."
I've send my Christmas parcel for my family with plenty of time to Germany and on the website it said 3-4 days. Yes it was in Germany that quick but now is stuck in the warehouse since weeks and my family isn't getting their Christmas presents probably till the new year. I wish I read the reviews before I gave them a try. My mum has tried to call their numbers literally over 100 times and the few times someone answers they speak little German and promise to sort it or call back but never do. I am so sad. This really ruined Christmas. NEVER AGAIN!
"I have had positive experiences with UPS in the past, but ordered a memory card from Best Buy on Dec 03/21 which made it to my local depot and then went missing. I waited because the website kept saying the delivery update would be made in 24 hours and there were shipping issues. My UPS driver, who is a nice guy, delivered another package and told me I should look into the undelivered package because they were all caught up with deliveries. He also said he would keep an eye out for any package for me at the depot. He is a really nice guy! So the next day on Dec 20/21, after talking with my UPS driver, I contacted UPS to see what was going on with the order. They started an investigation to determine if they could locate what they said was a missing package. Today on Dec 23/21 I called UPS to see what the status of the investigation was and they told me it would take up to ten business days to get the results of the investigation completed! I will not receive the results of the investigation until Jan 03/22 at the earliest and it will likely be later. Of course this being the holidays is causing issues. I ordered this memory card for a new phone and expected to have it installed and be using it well before now! In the past I have ordered several memory cards from Best Buy and they were all received quickly and without issue via Canada Post. Those were all delivered through a third party seller whereas this current memory card came directly from Best Buy."
Worst company ever to ship or deal with. Untruthfull and the worst Customer Service ever. look at their reviews. 92% are 1 star for a reason.
"23 Dec 2021
Reading these reviews is so depressing - UPS provide a terrible service but they are expanding every day - Good service is unnecessary for them - they make bank anyway. What a busted system.

Their chat bot is the WORST. It asked me no less than three times for my name and email before saying 'please wait a moment', but then nothing.... Just endless waiting.

10 Jan 2022
Update: UPS just seem to scan my delivery every day and not make any progress towards delivering it. When I call their line I am asked if I'd like to speak to an agent, I say yes, then an automated assistant talks for another two minutes before just ending the call. UPS are the honestly the worst and it has tarnished my opinion of the retailer who has chosen to use them to delivery my purchase - why would they chose UPS???"
"I read that UPS stores can take passport photos. At 11:00 this morning I called several UPS stores in my area. I understand that they are likely busy on this day two days before Christmas. Three stores did not pick up their phones. A fourth did, in Commack, Long Island. The female sales rep said 'sure, we take passport photos'. Come in."" I told her I would be there for the photos in 20 minutes.
When I walked into the store 20 minutes later, the man at the cash register told me that their camera was broken. I asked why the female rep told me to come in, and of course, he turned to the female rep and she shrugged her shoulders. The gentleman apologized and I left the store.
I certainly won't be purchasing anything at the UPS store in Commack ever!"
Bought a 5000 euro computer from Spain. Last week before Xmas. Gave them the money Sunday. Parcel out for delivery next day from Monday. So Tuesday nothing. Wed nothing. Now Thursday night and nothing. Even the sub standard tracking says the same damn thing it said 18 hours ago.
Ordered two different packages that were both delivered through UPS stated delivered packages were never received and I filed a claim. Had someone in there delivery department state package was delivered they have the delivery guy there and he confirmed notified them we have a ring door bell and it never went off for a delivery any that day. Also my boyfriend was home all day that day. They sounded very confused like I caught them in a lie when I told them we have cameras because we never received notification and our ring doorbell was never rung. Package was never delivered and UPS giving me the run around to find my stuff or reimburse me even after documentation was submitted stating 4 days before someone will contact me didn’t even know there delivery department called me to try to save themselves but got busted no footage of a delivery
UPS is the worst delivery company in the world! Carol Tome the CEO needs to step up and be more hands on. I met her when she was with Home Depot at a Grand opening at one of their stores. Home Depot seemed to be reign but UPS is a disaster! Go with Fed Ex. They are much more efficient. My package never arrived after 7 days of the first delivery date. I spoke with Scilla Chuidian at 404/338/1152 at the Atlanta Customer Service and she was not helpful. Look at their reviews they have a 1 out of 5 rating in ALL the reviews. When ordering something require they use Fed Ex. With UPS you will be dissatisfied.
The pieces of sh@& are holding my package hostage and they will not answer the phone
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! They lost my wife’s Xmas present when they delivered it to a completely random, wrong address, 2 hours from where it should have been delivered to. I’ve been promised call back after call back and even been guaranteed that they would go and collect it before bringing it to me. However in my last conversation with UPS, i was told that in fact there wasn’t even a note on the system that they would collect it and deliver it to the right address. Lie after lie and cock up after cock up. So I have no idea where my parcel is and no one even seems to care. Pathetic"
"I am 100 procent dissapointed. Delayed, badtracking. Expensive. Bad information. Never going to use them again."
"Just return my parcel because SERVICE DISRUPTION no communication, no explanation just return the parcel back. All documents were attached. So it is UPS becoming Hermes! Shame on you!!!"
"Wish that we checked Trustpilot before using UPS.

They keep charging money from our account, more than we agreed on. Customer service operators useless - we keep calling them, they say that they will contact us by email. Three more weeks passed and not heard from them at all.

Stay away from them."
We were kept updated on our delivery and it arrived before the estimated date. Very happy with the service.
if i could give 0 stars i would. i was told delivery was attempted when it never was. no knock on the door and no notice left. i didn’t even see or hear a ups truck. lazy service. terrible company
They claim they delivered my packages but didn’t. Now I gotta wait until I receive my money back for my items that my kids will not get for Christmas!! I’m am tired. I had a similar occurrence went them in 2019. They are horrible!!
Horrendous experience. A shipment was over a week late so the address had to be changed. I requested the change THREE TIMES only to have my requests completely ignored. So did the shipper who had the same result. They’ve now tried three times to deliver the package to the wrong address and it will likely end up being sent back despite both myself and the shipper calling customer service multiple times. The so called “customer service” representatives are completely clues and don’t give a s**t about customers receiving their parcels. The absolute worst. Completely useless. I would literally walk something across the country on foot in the dead of winter rather than ever engage with UPS again. Garbage company with garbage communication and customer service.
This company has an average review of 1 stars. They lie to your face and tell you that the shipper changed the delivery date when really the Next day air package that I paid an additional $80 for was really not being delivered because the UPS plane was late getting there. Anyone could start a package delivery service company and do better than this. This company is horrible.
In order to reach an agent I had to speak French to the recording.
Usually poor service is what ups should stand for. Don’t ever have them ship an iPhone the first one got cracked in transportation and the other one got a busted back camera. Great job ups being the worst Parcel delivering company if I could give it 0 stars I would. Fed ex Dhl and Amazon are way better
"I sent a package beginning of December within Ontario (for Christmas) The package was never delivered. When I called I was informed that the package never made it to their Mississauga Distribution Centre. I sent it from a UPS kiosk. After numerous phone calls from my end, no follow up from UPS, I am of the opinion that no one in UPS give a %%&!!. Will no longer use this company. There are many other reputable delivery service companies in Ontario who will do the job and not steal customers' parcels."
"Ive ordered 2 packages on Amazon and both were picked up by UPS. And both times they said my package was delivered and it never was. They claim they can't find my package, but it magically shows up at my house days later. You guys need to get better drivers and better customer service."
UPS i hope AMAZON take you guys down soon. You are the worst delivery company i had to deal with.
"I will never as long as I draw breath buy any products from a company or use UPS to deliver. UPS do not know how to deliver parcels on time and are a total waste of space. +90% negative reviews on this site should serve as a warning to everyone, please do not use this company as there is high chance the package will not arrive in a reasonable time if not all."
Totally rubbish ups… I’ve received a parcel from Spain today and the calculated euro to pound 0.83 when the pound should be 1.17 or around that figure anyway. Do not book a parcel through ups.
"They are absolutely USELESS! totally Irresponsible and unreliable!!!! without slightest exaggeration... never use their ""services"" they don't really have a service! even calling them costs us additional money not to say anything about our time and nerve... a lot of the operator in Germany hardly speak German, they don't know English... making it impossible to understand anything....."
"AVOID. Lost a package I sent, wouldn't let me open a claim because they will only deal with the receiver?! What?!!! I'm the one who paid for the shipping not the receiver. I'll never again use UPS. This is meant to be a global company. It's shambolic."
"useless post service, well done, cant speak to anyone make wrong vat invoice its just a joke.

Useless post service (UPS)"
Absolutley criminal service. Christmas ruined by their ineptness. Cannot speak to anyone outside of Asia. The worst.
"Well for now on if a business is using UPS I promise I will not buy the product UPS just messed up my children xmas I can't take off And they won't have xmas til after... All the hard work and tears I Occurred to get xmas right and UPS was to incompetent to be professional in there job descriptions...
Never Again... Teaching this to all I promise"
"Sent a parcel three months ago, that tracking says is 'on the way'. After numerous attempts to get an answer as to where it is, had an awful, garbled English email to say 'please wait' (despite a three month wait!) and now when I've tried to log into the website to make a claim for a refund, the website says I can't make a claim 'at this time'. Appalling customer service AND service and an expensive parcel lost with no way to get a refund of either the cost of the parcel OR the postage? Would never ever use again. Terrible service and a personal item lost. 😡"
Very dishonest company they claimed they have attempted to deliver bearing in mind we have a ring door bell and a CCTV which doesn’t show no UPS delivery ….Very poor service this should be also reflected on the companies that choice to use them with there 1 RATED STAR ⭐️ ON 90 Thousand plus reviews
"If I could give a 0 rating I would! I took some important documents to our local UPS Depot on Friday 10th December and paid extra for them to be delivered within 2 working days to Spain. The recipient informed us on Tuesday 14th December that they still hadn't received the documents. Upon tracking these documents, there was a message stating that I needed to pay an 'import fee' which I did on Tuesday 14th December at our local depot. We telephoned UPS Customer Services and Wednesday 15th December to be told that the package was at the Alicante office and would be delivered now that the import fee had been paid. Friday 17th December, the package had still not been delivered, despite confirmation from UPS that the import fee had been paid. My husband went into our local depot on Fri 17th Dec to find out what was happening, they confirmed that the package was still in the Alicante office and that he would chase this up and keep us informed, obviously this never happened! Monday 20th December, I check on the UPS tracker to see where our package is at, still showing 'import fee due' We call UPS Customer Services, they confirm, again, that it is at the Alicante Office, but assure as, as they can see that the import fee has been paid, that the package will be delivered either Mon 20th or Tues 21st! Wednesday 22nd Dec, tracking the package, nothing has changed, we call Customer Services AGAIN, we're now told that they have lost our package. UPS you're an absolute joke, these are extremely important signed documents that you have lost with personal information on. I would advise anyone who wishes to use a Courier service to avoid UPS at all costs."
"Delayed next day delivery. Save your money, use other courier services."
"It's a shame zero stars are unavailable- worst courier ever, avoid it like the plague. I had a delivery scheduled for me from the UK to Colombia. They picked it up in the UK with the invoice inside the box- and they were told it's there. After a few days, they said they are missing an invoice. I contacted them myself - saving I don't have the original invoice but I did send them one on their template. The Seller told them the original invoice is inside the box. They decided to declare that the receiver (me) 'refused delivery' and returned my item to the sender. They did not even call once to check!!!! Terrible service, avoid at all coasts."
"God Awful service from the moment it touches their dirty ass hands. Every single package I’ve had the unfortunate inconvenience of allowing them to ship has been delayed, attempted at the wrong address when the proper one was given, not scanned for days at a time while it’s in my city. Then if you decide to waste precious minutes on their garbage customer service they’ll direct you back to their website to a portal to track it when the drivers fail to do the simple task of scanning. Completely ridiculous that they even have a business at this point. Every time I see they have been selected to deliver my package I request it to be held because if you give them a chance to try and do their job you’ll never get your sh**t on time. Better to just let it sit so you can get it yourself. If you have the option to pay more for shipping PLEASE DO IT. Free isn’t worth it. It’s bound to get lost or delayed. I don’t even write reviews but I specifically made an account to write this. *F*uck UPS"
Delivery time was scheduled between 5:30 and 8:30 today but instead they came at 3:30. It was a package that is heavy and needed to be signed for. I called customer service to see if they can deliver after 5:30 or leave it at a location for me to pick up as I don't want her to carry the package tomorrow and come when I am not home but they want to charge me for their mistake. I refuse to pay for it as it was not my mistake. UPS has literally THE WORST customer service ever. I am even considering cancelling my wine subscription just because they are the ones that deliver.
"UPS customer service is already mediocre, but it tends to hit a new low every holiday season. Deliveries to wrong houses, packages marked as delivered but are nowhere to be found until until they show up the next day, and the tried and true ""sorry to miss you"" note left without a knock or a doorbell ring.

I immediately have a lack of trust in any company that ships their products using UPS."
"How or why anyone would pay these guys to deliver a parcel, beggars belief! They are by far the worst option out there. in the last 18-months they damaged a parcel (I paid to have delivered) so badly the item was no longer recognisable - costing me £200 in repairs. Their follow up strategy is to ensure the 'claims process' is so convoluted and illogical that seeing it through requires superhuman resolve and the patience of a saint (neither of which I have). They have wasted well over 30-hours of my time in the last 12-months with bogus delivery windows (It's their automated system, apparently - like that's a valid excuse). In the last two days I have been given two delivery windows, both of which came and went without delivery, in fact they didn't even offer up an excuse as to why - nothing. I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone, to be told that the item which was supposed to be delivered on the 20th... then the 21st, between 8:30 - 11:30 wasn't even with them until 1:00PM on the 21st... Absolute JOKE of a company. How they're still trading, with an active customer base is beyond me (a 1 star rating... seriously?!?) I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole!"
"Absolutely disgusting organisation... Their customer service is zero, the personnel who speak with you do not care nor do they have any empathy when one is trying to inform them that that ones parcel had not been collect as arranged. They actually told me to take my parcel to a shop at 1700 hrs night, after it was supposed to have been collected
My delivery go missing"
"ABSOLUTELY the WORST... My package has been sitting in Salt Lake City facility since Dec 9th and was scheduled for delivery Dec 16th... Here we are Dec 21st which happens to be 12 days later and it still hasn't moved... Absolutely a disgrace!! The world knows they have cargo planes etc... Dreadful service!! Use DHL, FedEx or USPS... Everything comes faster...maybe that's because they actually give a sh** about their customers, vendors and clients that use them."
Pathetic and Notorious service of logistics in Europe.Very improper and irresponsible customer service and tracking.Keeping the customers in dark and with improper communication they change there delivery according to company will without informing customer..who is given least importance.
"The delivery to Holland (booked via Parcel2go) was easy to arrange and arrived speedily. Lessons. Cheaper to book direct. Big NB ensure you print off 3 invoices as otherwise the recipient will pay duty. The driver asked us where the other copies were when he collected and we apologized and said we would do so quickly. However he kindly offered to print off more back at base as he was on a tight schedule. Appears not to have happened. Hence the duty which had to be paid in Holland. Our fault, but we could have done the copies as it was a present and never nice to have to pay duty on the doorstep for something sent to you. Contacted UPS to tell them what had happened - oh dear, no reply - ignored. Not great."
"Absolutely disgusting organisation... Their customer service is zero, the personnel who speak with you do not care nor do they have any empathy when one is trying to inform them that that ones parcel had not been collect as arranged. They actually told me to take my parcel to a shop at 20:00 hrs night, after it was supposed to have been collected (I paid for express collection) for 16:30!
I paid online 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for my refund :("
"THEY ARE THE WORST.
I had a delivery due to be given on the 10th of December and now it is 21st and the parcel still hasn't come.
They keep giving stupid excuses and not delivering the product.
It's a parcel from India and contains perishables which are all surely spoilt by now.
Pathetic company."
"They lost a laptop once that I returned to HP. Nowhere to be found. Yesterday a new situation happened. It said my package got delivered but it didn’t. Get file a claim, I tried to call them and hung up on my 5x didn’t let me talking to anyone."
"Waited on the Phone for 40 minutes to understand the government charges on my delivery.

Guy who picked up sounded like he was trying to talk without waking up his parents. Speak up mate.

Regardless, after taking my tracking number he hung up. Top notch service.

10/10, move out of your parents home Sanjeev."
"THE BEST COURIER SERVICE BY FAR. ALWAYS EFFICIENT, GREAT STAFF FROM DELIVERIES TEAM TO CUSTOMER SERVICE. ALWAYS GET PARCELS IN TIME."
"I have two packages with UPS right now.

Package one: they invoiced me a separate charge for a measurement error, but they did not count on me having pictures of my measurements. They said my package was bigger than it is.

Package two: they charged me extra fees for a border crossing into Canada. When I asked them what my options would be to avoid the fee, they said if you don't want to pay it, you can drive to the border and clear the package yourself. I'm not kidding. Unbelievable!"
"This company seems to be a lot of crooks.
It looks like they steal consignments, does not answer queries, supposedly open cases, then when you go onto the case number they tell you that the case does not exist.
I suspect the companies working with them are in cahoots with them to defraud customers, cannot see why else they would use them."
"UPS did not deliver the package to my door, ""Attempted delivery"" yet did not BUZZ up to my unit and did not leave any kind of notice. I had an injury and was unable to walk or stand. Only found out when I called in my package was at the pick up center. Spoke to someone on the phone, explained I was injured and physically could not go to the pickup center to pick up. They promised they would re-attempt to deliver it and NOTHING, they did not. Also did not notify me that the time my package could sit in the pick up location was ending. Almost had my packaged shipped back to the owner as I could barely make it to the pick up center in time. ABSOLUTE WORST, this has happened every-time they do not use the buzzer even though its printed on the package. If you live in an apartment highlight recommend choosing ANY other delivery service. I will no longer order with any company that ships with UPS as the service is horrid, agents on the phone are so nice BUT they make empty promises."
"International Delivery and tracking is a joke with these muppets. Ordered a priority international delivery from Amazon US to UK. Was told on four occasions that it was ""out for delivery"" on consecutive days. I telephoned them and was basically lied to by customer service reps, who are useless and just lie to get you off the call. Tracking suddenly stopped and part of it was removed. I was then told it was ""probably lost"" and I'm now in complete limbo. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long, long time. Amazon should really consider using an alternative to UPS."
"Outright liars. Look at their reviews, nothing more needs to be said. No one would choose to use UPS, you get stuck with them by cheap suppliers"
"Ordered a parcel from Germany they charged me almost half of the items worth for ‘non-taxable charges’ upon collection of my items from a UPS collection point. This was made immediately on collection of my parcel. Then received an invoice asking for the same amount again, tried to call but could not get through. Emailed them and received no reply. Currently on hold with them again and still nothing. They then sent another invoice asking for a late payment fee. UPS states payment is mandatory on collection of items so I’m confused as to why they have sent me another invoice even though I now have my items!"
"Zero customer support. Been emailing and calling for days. No one answers emails or calls. All they seem to be doing is shipping my package from one corner of Kempton Park Warehouse to the next corner of the warehouse. Literally, 30 emails were sent and 3 hours held on the phone..."
"Totally pathetic. Over last couple months several orders were not delivered on the day indicated on the UPS app. Usually one to two days late with no update on the app.

On a delivery on December 13th, the driver left the package outside, completely vulnerable to theft and weather. Interestingly, the driver left the box right under our sign that directs all deliveries to be left inside the door on the screened porch.

Again, pathetic. We have instructed companies that deliver here several times weekly not to use UPS or we will refuse delivery."
"Absolutely pathetic that my package was shipped on December 6th, and it’s been delayed twice. Quebec to Alberta. Now “supposed” to arrive on the 21st. Will never use UPS again.

Update; I found out that my package went from Quebec to British Columbia, back to Ontario, then back to British Columbia, then to Alberta. Finally received my package on January 6th. At least my package got to see the country during COVID..... Again, I will never use UPS again..."
Paid for next day delivery but took 5 days. Tracking didn’t correspond to actual delivery.
I ordered from Yoox and their shipping partner is UPS. I paid extra for Express Delivery. Package arrived in my country of origin on 14th December to their depot. Two days later I get a delivery delay notification. Was informed after calling the department supposedly called customer service that package is in customs awaiting clearance. Total lie. I checked with customs. It's within EU so no additional taxes or import duty apply. This is the fourth time I've ordered from Yoox and each time same experience. First time the package mysteriously disappeared. I'm writing to the European Ombudsman as the practices at this company need to be properly investigated. Packages just don't disappear.
"i would give zero stars if i could. the level of absolute incompetence of every single person i have encountered on the journey of trying to simply receive my parcel is astounding. the incompetence is in fact so immense that it is now nearly 2 weeks after the due date, and my parcel is nowhere to be found. it hasn’t been on the move for over a week and there is no longer a delivery date on my tracking information. absolutely useless excuse for a delivery service, i hope to never encounter this company again."
"UPS is very reliable and phone customer service is always very professional on the phone but unfortunately I will no longer use them as a shipping provider. The UPS Store on Park Ave. in Worcester played a very dirty trick on me. I was locked out of my email as it was only open on my phone because I forgot my password so I couldn't use the customer store computer. Though UPS Stores offer a service in which you can send an email to them so they could print the 2 copies I wanted for $3 and the price of the copies. Two days before this incident I did this action. But this day they said that they were busy and the male employee said he would do it for the $3 but I couldn't ask again. Then this lady employee with blond hair comes over and overules him and says ""no, the price is $6."" complaining that the store is busy at that it's $6 because it's the stores personal computer. She was very mean about it so I left without getting the service done. She raised the price in a split second. Two days before all their workers told me it was $3 How cruel and greedy can someone be? I don't ever want to go into that store again. Who would? I will now travel further to FedEx unfortunately. People can be so greedy and cruel. I believe we are continuing to see the loss of humanity in society at a increasingly alarming rate."
"If I would have knew that Macy's would use ups for delivery, I definitely wouldn't have ordered my grandson's Christmas gifts for delivery, not to mention Children's Place aswell, both said ""met customer"" however my son was at work til 7:PM and they claim tjis was around 3:15pm. I never recientemente my refund for items I sent my gson for school uniforms, supplies and a few other clothing items. Their service is terrible and they don't even have a number to actually speak with someone who can be of help. I'm so upset a week before Christmas and once again im out of over 400 dollars. SMH I would advice all to never use this service, trust and thank me later. The last time they wanted to come back out to my gson's home and his mother is a truck driver no one has time for that. They are a ring off and I really believe its all inside jobs as to why things come up missing because we never have this problem with the post office or fed ex. Unfortunately my son's ring was not activate as of yet best believe we'll never use them again and we'll definitely make sure we ask merchants who they use."
"On Friday, 12/17, my package was out for delivery. At 6 pm, I left my house to attend a holiday function. I was not concerned about my delivery. I knew it would be waiting at my front door as that is listed as my preference for the UPS driver.
When I arrived home, there was a note on my door stating ""sorry we missed you,"" your package was sent to an access point and the package won't be available for pick-up until Monday afternoon, 12/20.
When I spoke to a live agent, I was told the delivery change occurred because either my neighborhood is unsafe or the package was expensive. Neither are true. I've never had a delivery issue until now.
UPS, thank you so much for adding chaos to my already busy holiday schedule."
"They recently dropped the ball on delivering a cell phone. It flat out NEVER came. Their response was ""we are sorry"". My kids Christmas gift was supposed to arrive yesterday and then today. I spent all yesterday at home and all of today at home waiting and once again zero. 2 days in a row the package is supposed to be delivered and now the latest update states it will arrive 2 days from now. I have to leave town tonight. Thank you UPS you ruined Christmas"
It doesn't make any sense how slow these drivers and deliveries are. Y'all are so slow you make Amazon look good I will never have nothing else delivered by UPS ever.
"We ordered two pairs of UGG slippers for my dad’s bday and as Christmas gift for my mom which according to UPS were successfully delivered to them. Except they never received the package!
We called UPS and the person on the line (whom we could hardly hear) said that he will open a case and that UPD will initiate the search for the missing package 📦 and then will get back to us.
14 days after - nobody contacted us, so we called ourselves - and were told that now we have to contact UGG and follow up on the process with them - UPS customer service - you must be kidding? As a result my parents did not received their gifts, I’ve lost over 200 euros, and after two weeks of waiting have to spend hours of my life with your agents and the customer service of UGG! It’s 2021 - you can and lust do better!"
"Be careful of UPS at work!!! Very disappointed with this company's work. I was waiting for a package from my relatives. We chose UPS for delivery. UPS changed the delivery day 2 times, I took a day off at work and sat at home all day 2 times. When they changed delivery time in third time, I could no longer take a day off from work, because I was not even sure that they would deliver my parcel on this day. When I got back home from work, I saw a notification that they could not find me at home. I tried to change the delivery location but their system gave an error. Eventually I changed the day of delivery through the UPS system and took a day off again. Also, my sister (the sender of the parcel) called them and also asked them to mark a new delivery date, since the operator told her that he didn't see in the system that the day had been changed. 2 days before the new delivery date, the status of the parcel changed, that they allegedly tried to deliver it and could not. We called them again and the operator said again that the system had no information that we had changed the delivery day. The operator promised to enter our request into the system so that we receive the package on time. On the appointed day, the parcel was not delivered. And although the status was indicated by the tracking code as waiting for instructions, Oops the staff told me that it was lost. The package contained used children's clothes and a birthday present for my child from relatives. The money was returned, but unfortunately this money is not enough to buy everything that was bought for the child for growth 2 years ago. And naturally, no money will change the birthday present. And also this does not in any way justify the fact that: 1) The Ups website works poorly
2) Even after calling the support service, the employees did not see in the system that the date was changed
3) Parcel statuses are not true
4) They lose parcels in their own warehouse
5) They don't even try to search for the parcels, after the request for investigation, the result came in 20 minutes. During this time, it is not possible to review everything in the warehouse."
Spent 4 hrs trying to send a letter that I still haven't sent. Worst Site I've ever used whomever designed it should be castrated.
The UPS store in Peoria Illinois is not a customer friendly place. It is located in an area that has only three designated parking spots and shares an area with four other stores. The physical appearance inside the store is A MESS. This is not just during the holiday season but all year round. There is usually food and drinks on the counter . The place is too small for the amount of packages they receive. The staff is always attentive but as a lot of places seem shorthanded. Compared to Fed Ex which is clean and organized UPS falls short. Thank you
"They suck period!! Never contact people when having trouble locating house numbers, they don’t care if it’s a gift or not they don’t care what time of year it is, you get no notification they toss your packages around damage them constantly you could tell by how beat up the boxes are they leave them in the pouring down rain where they can get rained on and ruined and they could care less. Useless Time for a new package delivery company in town that’s for sure!!"
2 different Imports. First one box opened and part of the contents stolen by ups custom clearance staff. 2 box disappeared after one week. Total ore then 6000 euros. Customer service doesn't exist. Was a good company 20 years a go. I will switch to a real courier.
"Claimed to have attempted delivery at my home, which they did not.Simply dumped my parcel at a Customer Collection Point, without notification as to where, until I queried their nobody at home claim, which was false."
"I ordered a large heavy carpet. Deliveryday was supposed to be monday, but on thursday i got i message that they had tried to deliver it to me and could not, so the package would be taken to another location where i could fetch it. The problem is that they didnt try to deliver it to me. I was home whole day and did not recieve any phone calls or knocks on the door. This is like sevent time this happened with ups. I have never experienced a good delivery with ups. Customer service phone number did not work and my email has not been responded to."
Urgent package. Paid extra for overnight shipment. still no package after 3 days. Customer care don't have any other information than what I can see online which mentions that the package is still at the origin
Why would they show that a pckg was delivered tomorrow?? when tomorrow is not even here yet????
Ups is terrible. The automatic machine isn’t helpful and refused to let me speak to a representative. I rather just go start picking up my packages rather than use this service again.
"My service in the Cookeville TN office was amazing , above par .. when sending my box , ...BUT the receiving end not so much , the box was being sent to my son and his family , I got the text saying the box had Been delivered at 6 something pm , I text my son to let him know , he said. No box had been delivered , the next morning they found the box down the street on the side of the road on their way to work... Very disappointing! He said it looks like it had just been thrown on the side of the road !?!?!"
The worst website the worst service utter lack of any customer care.
"I would give this company zero stars if I could! We received notification of delivery on Monday, December 13. We were told that the item would arrive on Tuesday Dec 14th.
Then on the 14th, we were told that the delivery would arrive on the 15th. Ever since then we have been told that the delivery date would be given as soon as possible as they were “weather delays“. When tracking the item we could see on the map that it is in New Jersey, and we are located in New York. For the past few days there has not been any bad weather at all in the tri-state area. So, I have no idea why UPS is taking so long. I have chatted with someone in order to find out what is going on but, they use an automated system and not real people so all I keep getting is the lame excuse of “weather delays”. I cannot seem to get in touch with a human being. I highly suspect that anyone working for this company would be incompetent anyway.
It was not my choice to use UPS. UPS was used by the store who was shipping the furniture but if I would have a choice I would never use UPS. Shame on you! You are the most horrible shipping company on the face of the earth!!"
SO apparently I have to confirm that I paid for the package I sent in store. Or there will be an outstanding amount of money I owe. The most ridiculous system
"This was my Worst experience with customer Service i have ever seen. i called customer service to see if i could pick up my package they said yes and changed my delivery address to the warehouse location so i could pick it up and they gave me the warehouse phone number, which was fake or not working i don't know. so i called back then another lady answered then told me that the other customer support person was wrong and she will fix what she did but i might have to pick my order the next day. then i got a call from UPS claiming that customer are not allowed to pick up items in canada due to covid and what both customer support people said was miss leading and incorrect then he offered he could fix what they did, so i agreed for him to undo what they did. After that the order tracking got updated that i could go and pick up my item. so i called again, then the last customer support person told me that people can pick up there packages only if there was a failed attempt to deliver, which meant that the previous customer support person was lying when he said customer are not allowed in to pick up there items due to covid, so i asked to speak to a manager then the last customer service person tried to deter me from speaking to the manager by telling me the manager is unavailable. so i insisted on speaking to the manager and filed a formal complaint. the worst part of this experience is not that i will not pick up my package today, the worst part is that they could have just said we cant after the first five minutes instead of wasting three hours of my life and leaving my work to go to the UPS pickup location just to get a call telling me that the item will be delivered to my house after 3 days."
"Update:

After spending half a day on the phone yelling at UPS, the driver rolled by at 6PM with the package.

Too little-too late UPS. Our relationship is OVER!
-------------------------------------------------------

If there were ZERO stars it would still be too generous.

I've been sitting home all day in anticipation of a delivery. I just got an E-mail notice from UPS that a delivery attempt was made unsuccessfully.

THAT IS A COMPLETE LIE!!!!

I've been sitting next to the front door in anticipation of this delivery all day.

NO ATTEMPT AT DELIVERY WAS EVER MADE!!!!

Even the post office doesn't lie like this.

I've had it with UPS and will no longer do business with companies that continue to use them."
"Terrible pick ups with Amazon! They don't ring the bell, they leave the stickers and run away! my mother is almost 80 years old and has returns once in a while from Amazon and they are horrible! They don't wait to pick up the package. There is only one person who does, his name is Joe. Other than that - they are not doing their job! Plus we pay for amazon prime!"
"Parcels not collected. Customer service response didn’t make sense. Wasted so much time chasing. Tried to set up an ID to get better access and every attempt rejected. Promised email to help never arrived. (Yes, I did check in spam!) A very stressful experience. I was trying them out as a quicker service than Royal Mail. They’re not. Won’t be using again."
"UPS Mail Innovations is a joke. Got the run around for 3 days about the status of my package. Finally, they revealed the package was lost. Customer service is terrible. If you want to have something shipped, tell the shipper you do not want it shipped using UPS Mail Innovations. Shipping using UPS is bad enough. But having a combination of UPS and USPS is horrible. Whoever thought of that idea should have their head checked."
Jessica and Josh provided Excellent friendly customer service. Got customers in and out quickly during busy holiday season. Excellent customer service is a rarity these days so just want to say thank you!!!!
"If there was a way to score lower this is it, this got me very frustrated, In the UK here, so I order something from the US, so its been over a week and so forth, I check the tracking and see that its barely made it to the UK so they are taking a lot of time.

So I contact support.... there is no support, there was a live chat but on the US, and the transfered me to some international department that says that they are US based making ZERO sense.

So in the UK you can email or call, now I try calling a 4 to 5 times, in some I spent more than 30 mins, each time a bot will talk and never get the tracking ID correctly, so I forced the 00000 input trick to get and actual representative, and nothing. Been waiting like more than an hour for that.

To make this even more annoying aparently I can email them, but to do so I gotta login to their site, as it was already stressful enough I tried signing up with Google, but that does not work either, so I gotta make the actual account to talk to them.

So I gave up, I work with a few big companies and I will make sure never to use UPS and to badmouth on it every time someone mentions it."
"I received an email saying parcel would be delivered on a Tuesday , followed by one saying it would be Thursday. They then tried to deliver on the Wednesday in between. They didn’t leave parcel because they needed a signature. No one else does this in Covid times.parcel was taken to some pick up point I couldn’t possibly get to. Nor could I have carried it! I have now telephoned three times and still have no parcel. I’m told it may be next week One said they delivered on Saturdays another said they didn’t. In future I shall make sure companies are NOT using UPS before ordering."
"If I could put a Zero for customer service and delivery I would. As I was track my delivery it stated that an attempt for delivery was made on Thursday 16 December but no response. This is were UPs shoot themself in the foot, I was home all day, I went downstairs and there was no note to say they had been. I called UPs at 16:45pm, the only thing I regret not doing is selecting record the conversation as the representative informed me that he would get someone from Croydon Depot to call me within an hour to reschedule the delivery for today. The guy said his name was Brian which I believe was a fake name as the somehow did not match the accent I was hearing.
Today Friday 17 December I called UPs again, this time I got a lady and I explained what had happen the previous day and she said there was no record on the system, I gave here all the details and I said to her this time I selected call. Then halfway through the conversation, she said oh I can see the record on the system that you call, I said to her that you already said that you could not see it and that I will get the Depot to call you in an hour. I called at 9:13 am and I still have not received a call from them and the time now is 11:10 am. I have no choice but to call them again as I need to get the blinds delivered as I will be going into isolation due to an up-and-coming operation scheduled for next week and I can not go out to pick them up. I personally would not recommend UPs to anyone, the only reason I am having to connect with them is that blind2go uses them as their courier.

With all of these low ratings, I would have thought that UPs would improve their customer service profile and branding as a company that delivers great customer service and on time."
"Worst company - please avoid them and spare your health.

I posted a handmade Drum in August to Canada. 5 months later to December, the claim has been opened and escalated. UPS confirmed that the Drum has been lost. I had to refund the customer.
Ups are ignoring me and don't want to refund the money back. £300, that is a lot of money.
I will have to contact an independent company who deals with situations like this because I am too stressed...
Customer service is non existent with UPS... Every time I phoned to get some updates, they either hung up on me or kept transfering me to a different department withouth giving me any answers...
They have failed to provide me a service and because I have proof, there are laws in UK protecting businesses like myself. In self employed, this is stressful, however I will go to the very end to get my money back..."
I received various different dates for delivery of something that was to be a wedding gift for my daughter. In the end I tracked the parcel to be told it had been delivered on a day when I was home (it hadn’t) and their idea of evidence was that «it had been put in mailbox”. Dreadful service dreadful follow up. They ought to be ashamed
"I tried to follow my package. It said that it would be delivered on the 17the of december between 11:30 and 16:30. It was a day early. I was at home, but what is I wasn""t?"
"We live in a very rainy area (it's gray/rainy today) and it's winter. Several covered areas including our front door are very close to where the inconsiderate (lazy?) driver left the box, which was against a wall on the driveway."
"MY UPS ref : 29TC12G0I2G
Don’t choose this idiot company, I did booked an collection, I have been told driver will collect it tomorrow between 9AM to 7PM. I waited and wasted my whole day because of this crap company. No one has come to collect my parcel. When I ring them back I just heard ""apologies, we can arrange for tomorrow with same huge time gap"". So unprofessional.

Highly NOT RECOMMANDED."
Driver returned package to sender claiming there was no address available. Every Google search and maps search pulls the address up perfectly.
"Utterly disgraceful. Had a gift sent from Germany to Vienna. Ordered end November. Delivery attempted 3rd December. Parcel dropped at access point. Driver claimed recipient not at home! Austria is in lockdown. Family was absolutely at home!
Redelivery requested. Ignored! Complaint to UPS Austria - responded quickly - arranged redelivery. Didn't happen. Recipient picked it up 16th December along with another UPS parcel which never had a delivery attempt. Seemingly this regularly happens with UPS drivers failing to deliver in this area."
UPS has always been the worst shipping carrier and I absolutely HATE their service and stores that use they have made my holidays suck not once but TWICE in a few weeks I hope someone buys them out and makes this better
Absolutely useless. Supposedly ‘delivered’ my parcel but never did and I haven’t received any communication on where it is either. Do not use this delivery company. DPD and Hermes are fantastic!
"I sent some fragile lamps and they arrived completely smashed. I had paid for insurance and they won't even refund me for the cost of delivery.

I had received these lamps delivered by another carrier and they were fine, sent them off again with UPS in the exact same packaging and they were broken into many many pieces


Absolutely appalling, I will never use this company again.

Customer service was almost impossible to access and could barely speak english."
Useless tracking number never delivered on time never collected on time you will never know when parcell be delivered shame
"I do not want to make conclusions but regarding my parcel, I am dissatisfied with the service. The first problem was that nobody has contacted me and instead tracking information was saying that sender and receiver was contacted which is not true. Then I was told that the invoice was wrongly scanned and if I can send it which I couldn't because only once was available after payment for delivery and I didn't think that there will be problems, therefore, I did not save this invoice to my computer. Then I was told that I need to provide a Power Of Attorney so I have sent the power of attorney that has been sent from Amsterdam, did not get any reply on that. Instead, I have received another form to fill in and the original invoice via email. So I've sent it and then I received that the shipment will be delivered. Then silence... I checked the shipment in the tracking and I was more than surprised that the shipment was refused and will be sent back to the sender... I never refused this shipment and again, nobody has contacted me. I do not understand how come that somebody else from UPS has contacted me that they do not have my contact details. I have added contact details when I was doing the order. I called the support and they told me that VAT needs to be paid which I did over the phone. And then I have been told that the new date for delivery will be scheduled within two days. No scheduled date has been done, instead, the parcel arrived and I was asked for payment once again. So I refused to pay as I have paid VAT already, so the driver left. Later I noticed that someone put a sticker on the parcel saying that I refused to pay. Then the customer support has told me that they will contact the billing department, however, the following day the driver may be coming as they told me and will ask me for payment once again because he seems to work independently no matter on headquarters. The next day, although was confirmed that the driver should come, nobody came. The day after nobody came as well. And the day after I decided to go to UPS headquarters and pick up the parcel on my own. When I came, they asked me for payment so I had to call customer service who confirmed to their employee using my phone that I should not pay anything. So, in summary, I had made countless calls where each instruction or confirmations were different from each other and I had to spend hours and gas to get to the headquarters and I am not talking about time at the work that I lost. And on top of everything I have noticed that the parcel is damaged. So I have sent based on instruction report of that to the email. Now I am waiting for their reply.

UPDATE: After a month I have called UPS to find out what is the conclusion of my report of damage. They did not contact me and if they did via e-mail, it was not delivered. So they told me that in their system is a note that parcel was insufficiently packed which I do not know how they come to this conclusion. The box was new with strong cardboard and it was wrapped with solid tape. They did not say anything about the lost item from the parcel.

UPDATE 2: Seems that UPS is working differently in each country, while in one country was closed the case, in another country, they refund delivery costs plus what was missing. This is good news, although I had to experience described difficulties."
"Again UPS fail to deliver, after days and days of delays and UPS emailing to say it's been rescheduled, finally the package is ""out for delivery"". As expected an hour or so later I see the SMS.. it's been delivered! Wait that is odd, no knock at the door, no door bell. I check the tracking ref, 'left by front door', no proof of delivery, no photo. I live in rural location and only have three neighbours so it's impossble to incorrectly deliver, yet UPS excel at this. I call Apple and they have investigated but nothing has been done after a few more days and they simply will despatch another item. If it wasn't true you wouldn't believe it. How is UPS able to get away with this it is beyond me!? I feel so utterly dissapointed."
"My parcel is blocked at customer and from a non intuitive website (I spent more than 1h trying to find a way to upload the requested document), support agent shouting at me saying ""click on the link at the bottom of our site"" while there is no link to click. I had no other choice than to declare the parcel lost.
PS: I'm a software engineer and very savy in internet browsing. You site sucks, you mobile app sucks, you customer service sucks. I will never again use your ""lack of"" services. Viva DHL"
The worst company ever the biggest scammer they have a lot of hidden fees I waited over 5 days for a package to come to my home never mind the fact that I paid them $43 to deliver it and then they had their hidden import fee of 31 something dollars. Waiting over 5 days for a package to deliver to my home which never came driver proceeded to lie and say that he attempted to deliver to my house then when I called a young man wanted To tell me the reason why I hadn't been delivered is because there was an import fee which was Garbage considering when I spoke to them when I 1st got the call they told me that I could pay that when he got there because I wasn't comfortable to put in my credit card on the Internet. So I ended up paying the fee because the individual told me once I paid it my package would be delivered to me tonight which was completely Garbage he only wanted to get my money then when I called back his supervisor wanted to tell me no we don't make 2 attempts in a day So his coworker only told me that to get money which was kind of stupid considering it was only $30. I would never recommend using this company ever again they're scammers and lazy employees very lazy employees.
UPS has a known dangerous gang member and drug dealer working for them. His name is Reggie Battle and he works out of the Hapeville Ga office and he is delivering packages to peoples homes. I learned this via a press conference on the news when he was arrested and indicted. This is not ok !
"My bank card had money stolen off it. 19.99 was sent to ups my choice. It showed a number of the company so I called , told them that someone hacked my card and I wanted the money back. Some very rude customer service""person"" told me nothing. Call your bank is all he kept saying. I told him to please stop the transaction cause the money was stolen. I got the same thing from him. The charge was still in pre authorization when I called. A little later, the took the money before I could get to the bank to stop it. They were told it was stolen and they STILL except the money. I thought this place was run by the feds, so what's up with them excepting criminal activity. Watch your money because these people will except it KNOWING it's stolen money."
"Once again, my previous instructions have been completely ignored. I clearly stated that I do not want any parcels going to any local collection point as the one that UPS use is far from secure! The staff there are rude and unhelpful! Parcels are strewn across the floor and personal details are in full view of anyone entering the premises! Why is it so hard for someone to follow some simple instructions?"
"Do you want to ship something fragile? Go elsewhere. Multiple signs were stating that our shipment had glasses, was fragile, and to please handle with care. It's almost as if these neanderthals were deliberately trying to break our shipment. Imagine calling your recipient to ask how they like the painting, only to find out that the glass and the frame was broken in pieces. Very disappointed. Maybe the employees are over worked, but does that mean they need to mishandle the boxes they are responsible for? A shame I can't do more than to warn others too please please please find another way to ship your fragile items. Truly heartbreaking."
Tried to meet the delivery person and he was rude. Instead delivered the item to my front door even after speaking to them. How rude is this? Use Amazon they are nicer.
"We wrapped up a package in Texas. It was accepted in Texas. When it got to me in Pennsylvania, it was filled with holes. I was missing items and my gaming computer and monitor was smashed. I spoke with several people at ups, said it wanted wrapped right. If it wasn't wrapped right, why would Texas accept it. I just think ups doesn't want to play their claims."
"of all the packages I've ever had delivered by many companies, this was painful to experience. After I made a purchase from bad-dragon a sex toy shop I realized I made a mistake on the apartment number. I tried to contact them and they told me to contact ups. I went to their sight made an account and tried to change the address as soon as possible. However, they only allow you to change the address after a failed delivery, and as for the info number they would give after that.

So I had to call them and contact them both on phone and on chat to get this changed and they assured me it would go through. That was yesterday and still don't have my package, so I called to explain the situation for the third time, their excuse this time was that the name was didn't match the address which has never been an issue before, literally anywhere, and was told to wait another day while the issue was fixed all because I wanted to avoid an incredibly awkward situation with my neighbor. Please fix this UPS, this is beyond ridiculous."
"I use UPS quite a bit and usually have no complaints. Our delivery driver is awesome and works really hard in our area; always rings the bell to let us know he's dropped something off. Our local UPS store is the best. But today I recd a box, clearly marked fragile, and was severly banged up. If it hadn't been for decent pking, the glass jars would have been destroyed. But, I would take UPS over Fed Ex anyday!"
"The worst delivery service known to mankind. Staff are clueless, they lie. Delivery drivers are useless who don't want to deliver parcels."
"I would give them zero stars if I could. I have been using them via 3rd party company for a couple of years now and recently they can’t even be bothered coming to pick up parcels 80% of the time when a collection is booked. Furthermore, they have charged £100 for a single (slightly above size parcel) twice on the one consignment completely wiping out my profit margin. The original cost per parcel should be around £10 so they feel that a 1000% surcharge is justified. When you complain, you occasionally get a phone call to apologise but nothing ever changes. Truly the most appalling carrier I’ve ever had the misfortune to deal with and they will be replaced ASAP in 2022 when I can get a new courier to take on my distribution. I will of course deduct these ridiculous surcharges from my final bill and look forward to seeing them in court if required. I wish I could charge them for the amount of times they have lost, damaged my parcel or just failed to turn up. I would be a multi millionaire. Do yourself and your business a favour. DO NOT consider UPS. I think they genuinely believe as they are so busy just now in this strange world we’re living in, they can do what they whatever they please and charge whatever they please including ridiculous fuel surcharges which should already be part of the consignment cost. Utterly appalling company."
UPS is horrible. They lost my package and I can’t even contact a representative. I’m so tired of these corporations doing whatever they want and not caring. So glad I wasted money. UPS sucks
"Avoid at all costs. I have had the pleasure of using UPS both personally and commercially and I can't recall a single positive experience. Their incompetence and unresponsiveness have caused many problems for me and my employer. They may have a bit of marketing clout and seem like a large company but this is a false image. Avoid, avoid, avoid - and save yourself a great deal of hassle."
"This is perhaps the worst company operating. I wish businesses would use or give options on shipping. I would definetly use someone else. Fedex delivers my packages without issues, but not UPS."
"How do I know that UPS has attempted to deliver my package, apparently not been able to and then left it at a pick up point without leaving a slip to say so. Hmmm leads me to believe that no attempt was made. Shocking service."
"After 2 weeks I got a message from UPS that they were not able to find the door. I call the service and ask why don't the driver just dont call me if we cant find the door. The answer was that the drives don't have any phone!...... I replied that you are the only company that has that policy...... ok, I told them I can pick I up at a pick-up point... now soon 1 week later I have still not received any parcel. This is not the first time I struggle with UPS... have had lot of experiences from DHL, TNT, Bring, PostNord, Posten, Porterbuddy, FedEx and they are just why better."
Worst company in this world….. I hate UPS WITH MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!
"Please shut this company NOW!!! You are an absolute joke, lost parcels, delayed, damaged and never taking accountability. Extremely poor service, I really feel bad for the people who work in customer services for them."
"I just called the service center in CH, because the app was not providing the information I was looking for. The gentlemen I had on the phone, was not listening to my story and comments, he talked me down, was arrogant and very unpolite. I am very much upset how I was treated. Very unprofessional. Never, ever use UPS again"
"I called the customer service team at 09:13 today (15/12/2021) and after getting through the very restrictive IVR (only option is to say the options and no keypad!) I was put through to someone heavily breathing down the phone line, after waiting about 10 seconds, I asked if anyone was there and I was just hung up on! I need to get this sorted today, and emailed instead now waiting for a response, not very happy, product sent for repair is now stuck in limbo as UPS are trying to charge import tax on the item even though it's already been paid once."
"Unfortunately, цу tried to work with this company. Long deliveries, incredibly high prices and a huge number of hidden payments. They lost an expensive package we sent six months ago. We have not received any compensation so far. Moreover, they write that the parcel has been found (it's scary to imagine what condition it is in) and we are still obliged to pay for its return. Never use this company and do not offer its services to your customers!"
"Appaling.
Gave me cost of parcel. I paid it. In Poland they requested confirmation of cost of parcel, which I paid to them and they didnt klnow. That come twice from 2 different employees. Then they charged tax, which was more than value of parcel and value of courier cost.
Definitely not going to use ever again."
UPS sent an email saying they tried to deliver my package and again they did not buzz the number to get in my building. The buzzer number is posted out side of the building and All they had to do was read the note posted for UPS. I contacted New York and Company and told them about UPS and their delivery.
"Worst service ever for people in apartment , it's going awful,ups wont hold my package for pick up to a specific access point, and keeps attempting delivery at the apartment, and doesn't even call when near. I call there and get hung up on Twice ,then lied too by another agent he will page the truck to have it taken there for pick up tommorow wed . There is no update in the tracking it is being taken there, I tried about 50.times already to use ups my choice, and everytime I sign up ,it back with error saying address already in the system, so I can't control delivery, and worst I payed 75.00 dollars in import fee, and their still jerks ,I hate being treated like crap,and now I might lose my package,a request was put in ,and why not hold it for pick up? This is the worst service ever from ups . Horrible !! I'm afraid I wont get my package for the holiday."
"My worst experience ever with delivery my £500 dress was meant to be delivered by Ups but they sent it to a store that don’t open. I called customer service they said they will re delivered on Thursday 16th of December. I just track it again now but it says delivered to me. HOW? I am so confused, what the **** is going on? I am so ******* upset and angry 😡"
"Wow the reviews aren’t looking too good! So here is ANOTHER ONE, To add to the compliant list.
So I was expecting a £300 jacket to get delivered but it hasn’t arrived. Was shipped last wednesday and had a time of due date of delivery to be with me by Friday! I’m still currently tracking it and it hasn’t been scanned since then. I then get an automated update on the app saying it will be delivered on Monday, then Tuesday but still no sign. I find it strange how it hasn’t been scanned back into the depot and on the tracking it was last scanned Friday still, but yet it’s saying it will be with my on these days. I feel like I’m left in the unknown. I’m also going to assume my parcel has been robbed by one of your scummy UPS drivers. Wouldn’t be surprised! Seen the same thing happen to other people that has happened to me. An absolute diabolical experience with shoddy UPS! I wish merchants would use a different courier to send out customer goods!"
"For some unknown reason they delivered my signature required parcel to some else. Not only that, but the house number was nowhere near mine - they delivered it to a random shop at number 119... My house number is 324. What the heck? Just...come on.. How? Why? It's like the driver was just like: 'nah man you're too far I'mma drop this off here. Job done' XD"
"If i can give 0 star i will! Worst delivery service ever!been waiting for my package for 2 weeks now, then now you cant find it and your delivery person were lazy!!"
"I live in a very rural area. For some reason the driver will always toss our packages next to my mailbox. The mailbox is about 75 yards from my house. It makes it very easy if anyone would like to steal packages that are left. It also has no protection from weather, so if it would rain the package will be damaged. I have called myself, and my son that lives with me has also called numerous times to complain about the service, and yet nothing has been done to correct this problem. Can we boycott UPS for any other delivery service that can make a proper delivery?"
"Very hit and miss. First time using was great, UPS collected on time etc. Second time i asked no earlier collect than 10am, they came at 7:45am and sped off so fast i couldnt even open the door! So just didnt do their job. I believe my parcels arrive safely but not a good first impression."
Lost an expensive package. Case opened. Better off using a carrier pigeon!!!
"Package stuck in Grezy-Sur-Aix. Stolen? lost? No information. My package was promised yesterday, but no sign of it 👎👎
2 days after my package was promised and no package or reason why it wasn’t delivered."
"I have gone rounds with these people. My deliveries have been hit or miss, it depends on the day and the driver. This is unacceptable, as this is how my diabetic supplies are delivered. They have screwed up my most recent shipment, and I have now been without my supplies for four days. I have explained this to a local supervisor, (that was like pulling teeth to get in contact with) and nothing has been done. I don't have this problem with Amazon. Why? Because they have this convenient little spot to include delivery instructions. UPS should take note, literally and figuratively, because as things stand now, they're a joke, and I wish I didn't have to deal with them."
"This carrier - UPS, is by far the worst one, I have ever dealt with ! I’m shocked that anyone uses them !

Ten different agents, I contacted over the course of 2 days, to update my address with a unit number...and 10 times, they said that they have it now - and then 10 times, they later said “no” & I still had to update them.

No one is that incompetent !!!!

Anyways, I finally gave up trying to be heard & just asked for my package to be returned, and to get a refund for my import fees.

I will “never” order anything through them again !!!!"
"4 times they would charge me more after the shipment was set, saying weights and dimensions were off. These were not $4 charges, one was $18 extra. I always round up on dimensions and weight, and never have a problem with USPS. Recently, I had an item destroyed in shipping. Insurance is suppose to cover $100 (which the item was). I have been going around in circles with them. Telling me to put in a claim - claim was already in. They say they sent the letter back to sender - they sent it to an address that was 1. Not on the package. 2. I hadn't lived there in over a year. Go online to talk to a chat rep and the give me a phone number. Call the phone number and they say ""go online"" and drop the call. Go back online to talk to a chat representative and they say I need to call to talk to a chat representative. They told my customer to keep the box/damaged item in case they need to come inspect it....All for $100 claim. I'm absolutely livid and disgusted. You try to email and it's like they don't read what you write. Just ""sorry"" and ""here's another dead end number/link/pdf"""
"ZERO-STAR. Absolutely atrocious, UPS. You have no regard for customers and their shipments. I booked a UPS Express for the urgent courier of a very important document that is supposed to arrive in 2 days. But the document was stuck in export in Cologne for an entire day and not shipped out because of a missing invoice. I only found out after tracking the document myself. No one called to inform me or ask. I had to call, many many, many, many, many, many times to tell them again and again, it is a document. No invoice is required. Yet, no action is taken. At this rate, the document is unlikely to arrive at the destination as promised, UPS. I demand a refund and a proper explanation."
"I can’t believe a company of this size, with such poor delivery service and below average customer service is still in business. I have never seen such incompetence on such a large scale, repeated package after package. If only I had a choice in the company people use to send their parcels to my business. It would not be these guys, by a long shot."
"Lost two Christmas packages for the kids and they are very rude people was hung up on over asking about the order for stuff that kids are not going to get for Christmas JCPenney same thing place I ordered it from no help only capital one credit is considered my concern wow thanks ups and merry Christmas to all your kids!!!! F/B, mfers."
"Customer service sucks. They just copy and paste answers I can read on the site. My package keeps saying transferred to USPS one moment and the next back to ""sorted through facility ups"". Tried to talk to a customer service and was told I don't have the right to ask about the package the shipper does."
I hadn’t placed an order and ups are delivering it I placed the order a weeek ago and it has arrived at the ups depot it’s been there nearly a week now tell me how the fu*k can it take a week to arrive when it’s been sitting at there delivery depot wonder why no one likes ups I’ll make sure I don’t get my stuff delivered by them again it does not take that long at all start moving about instead of sitting there all day playing with each other knobs hurry up I want my parcel you THANKS
"The worst delivery service! Amazon orders which were sent internationally and ""luckily"" were passed on to deliver by UPS were either not delivered (in August) and not refunded, no way to contact the right Customer service, so gave up.
Called customer service few times giving the number of the person recieving the parcel, the security code, hasn't been passed onto driver.

Another one, just yesterday, Christmas present for family member - the mesaage came from UPS saying ""failed to deliver, held at pick up point"". The person was at home and noone even tried to deliver."
"We lost for our company several of package UPS tells us to mail us but I somehow didn’t do it. Every claim we put out there they don’t except or I have something else to hide . Please remember my experience it’s honest.The shipment most of the times it goes of course good and then it’s also fast something that you can. I think of with express post . We have a last of around €10,000 in a year we ship 4000 package . Don’t think if you have a proper express company they will send you the money . A lot of work a lot of telephones and at the end it’s nothing sorry this is my experience with UPS at the end of the year we make the count how much it was and it’s around 11,000 . Also they not even gift the shipping cost back . I just don’t recommend it if you have a web shop . I hear better stories of DHL . Express post and service . I hear FedEx is even worse ."
"Worst service ever delivered my package to wrong address then put the burden of there investigation on me,was late giving as gift after weeks of investigation.finally got my package but it had been opened and had to return it very unhappy with UPS"
I've had nothing but bad luck I don't think that you guys do anything that you say you're going to do I've still got a package out there that has been delivered and I also had a package that was damaged completely breaking a number of things I think that you guys need to rethink your business and be more customer friendly and your manager in Ogden on Harrison has not called me back and I have called many times I would not recommend ups to anyone
I don’t like to write reviews but I’m tired To keep calling ups and giving wrong answers and lie to me about my package Status is a disgusting company the drives keep mess up dropping the package to the access point the first time they never drop my package to the access point i call and they say they hold my package but I never pick and it was overdue day they have to return the package to the company that I get my order. They return the package. Now I order from other store and the first attempt because I wasn’t home I understand that part the packet didn’t drop at my house. But they give me s paper to pick at the access point and the driver mess up again and didn’t drop the packet I still waiting to delivery again to my house I have to wait 3 day or until Christmas to get my package because the stupids employees don’t do a proper job and this lady Michael +1 (718) 706-3199 from the claim department instead of find a solution she was saying it was fault because the package i didn’t take the first time attempt stupid excuse all the time. I can give a 0 to this stupid company
"This is the worst delivery service to date. They need better delivery drivers, customer service reps that listen and get rid of the auto system all together. This company has really gone down hill. I’m so disgusted with their service,"
"When they sent me a pickup notice with the facility address they didn't indicate days and hours of operation, And of course that information is not available anywhere online. Finally I found something close on Google maps. It took driving out of town twice to find the real schedule hanging on a door 'round the corner. Good thing I have a Prius."
"Money Back Guarantee - NOT!! I sent something Next Day Early (8am) which has a guarantee. They said, ""it's delivered on time or your money back."" Well, it was delivered two days later. It took weeks to get the refund processed (I had to call 3 times!), then when I got the check, it was for a lesser amount ($112 instead of $134). I called and they said ""they deduct for the regular cost of the shipment such as fuel,..."" etc.), but their website says nothing about fuel or operational costs: ""Where the money-back guarantee operates, if we deliver outside our time commitment on applicable services, we will on request refund or credit you with the shipping charges (or the proportionate part of those where only some of the packages in a shipment fail to meet the applicable time limit), net of any VAT, duties, taxes or levies, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled"". This was a personal item sent from CA to OR, so no VAT or duties or taxes or levies. This is disingenuous and quite a bait and switch. If something is truly time-sensitive, you are taking your chances and will not get all your money back, and it will be a hassle."
"Horrible company. All my packages were lost. I don’t think they have been lost, they have been stolen. They need to look after those drivers. And they know what they are doing, they are taking only packages when there is no option to submit a claim. And it happens only holiday time comes."
"My shopping experience has been amazing. Shipping fast, quality ok. Like a physical store.
I’ll buy again here."
"I looked at the reviews and thought what's the point given the current score. Only wish I had looked at these reviews before using UPS. I have sent 3 packages as part of one shipment. I needed a fairly urgent EU delivery. Did the online application that's taken ages to complete and filled out all sections. Could not get the packages collected from home as this was not available, so dropped them off at an Access Point. All good till then. Four days later courier turns up at my address returning one of the packages with a sticker attached. We asked what the problem was but we're told it is indicated on the sticker. It actually did not say anything as the ""other"" option was ticked. Had to call the overseas customer services to find out that a commercial invoice was missing from the shipment. Weird as I did not see that online and I am not a commercial entity... In the end I have requested that UPS return the rest of my packages as I had another way of sending these by now. Well, that was the beginning of the nightmare. I have spoken numerous times to customer services to see what is going on and tried other ways of contacting the company. It has taken over two weeks for UPS to return the packages and that only after I have undertaken a 160 mile round trip to intervene directly at their Stanford-le Hope warehouse. I have spoken to a lady there who promised to push things along. I cannot believe how disorganized can such large company be. The overall service or the lack thereof can be described as shambolic. I would highly discourage anyone from using UPS in the future."
WORST SERVICE EVER! PACKAGES HELD IN CUSTOMS AND CHARGED RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF CUSTOM CHARGES. DON'T USE THIS SERVICE EVER!
"I was suppose to have a part delivered today for my SUV so I can finally get my SUV on the road. It was here at our local UPS in Petoskey, Michigan just 1 hour away and someone there decided I didn't need my package today and sent it to Jackson, Mississippi and now won't be here until Friday. And I told them I have an appointment to get it done tomorrow and they said they wanted to help then immediately said there's nothing they can do. They have STUPID people I guess working for them and don't give a crap. I myself will NEVER ship with UPS again cause they don't give a S--- about their customers. They just more or less say give me your money and one day you might get your package."
"I ordered a bike. When I saw the first delivery attempt I contacted the place where I ordered the bike from and they told me to contact ups. I contacted them and they had told me they had the wrong address. Ok, my mistake. Mistake fixed. Next day, I see another delivery attempt. I called them. Oh, he was having a hard time finding the place. Ok, it should be there tomorrow. Next day, third delivery attempt. I call them, they tell me don't worry, we will hold your package for the next 5 business days. The next day, the package was returned to sender.

I could have reroute the package if I knew they were lying about everything.

Very frustrating. Such poor service."
Got an international shipment that somehow was missing a house number and instead of contacting me via email or giving me a form to correct the information they just sent it back to the sender 🤦‍♂️
The most unreliable courier company in Australia. I had to eventually use a more reputable courier after UPS failed to action my 3 scheduled pickups. It's a wonder how they operate worldwide.
"This courier service is indeed the best definition of substandard, inadequate, immoral and awful service i have encountered. I have to be fairly honest, people who works here has no sense of knowledge, has done nothing but to just answer the queries of people—THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEYRE TALKING ABOUT, and they are wasting people’s valuable time

I will never ship my parcel with UPS. And will suggest not for you to use this courier— thank me later."
Promised I’d write a good review for my man Corey. Works at store in Greenville South Carolina on E North Street. Got to the store one minute after close but still took my return packages.
"This company is irresponsible; i paid the taxes duty before they delivered the item, but they claimed no payment was received even you showed the invoice payment that had already been paid. They return the item to the seller without investigating where the fee goes. i paid £ 1200 for nothing! Such a frustrating experience!"
"Here’s a joke for the books…what can ups, a shipping company that ships items not do? Deliver a package! Hahahahaha, funny right? No? I don’t think so either.

Paid for two day shipping. Waited two days, on the second, the package said that it was out all day and by 9 pm when it wasn’t there, I called to check on the status. The UPS representative promised that the package was out for delivery. It wasn’t. Twenty minutes later, the status changed to be delivered Monday (which is NOT two days! I’d like my money back!). Called and spoke to four different representatives who gave four different stories, blank apologies, nothing helpful. I asked if I could go pick it up from their distribution center or a ups store-any ups store! I was willing to drive as much as it took!-and I get bs about how there’s nobody there on weekends (please. As if.). The fourth person I talked to promised to give the distribution center my number in case the useless pieces of s could do anything about it, and promised they’d call in the morning. Nope! I called back again, a fifth time, and was told the distribution center never bothered getting back in touch with me but left a note on their inner system. Then was told by the rudest, most disgusting, bottom of the earth, sexist customer representative (this is paraphrased) that it’s not their problem, there’s nothing they can do, that they know how I feel, and that my frustration is a useless emotion because they won’t be doing anything about it. So after that beauty of a phone call, I resigned myself while being really upset and really angry because ups really, really screwed me on this one, and was just waiting for Monday. Now, I have an update that it won’t get here until Tuesday. What the f is the point of two day shipping? From here on out, I’m not ordering a package if it gets shipped through ups. Period."
"Trying to track a package, called usps, all you get is an automated answer, and then you get disconnected, great way to run a busniess. So I tried another number, finally got someone but he said he knows nothing about packages.I wasted 45 mins trying to call usps with no luck.You have better chances talking to someone from SSI and we know how that is. Simply horrible."
"Sucks .Im disabled in a wheelchair and waited for a delivery all day as it WAS Out for delivery.At 8:50pm I checked tracking ""on the way est delivery 9:20pm"" Then a message 9:05pm Driver couldn't contact recipient rescheduled for tomorrow without never comming down my block which my security camera clearly show and I was in my window 10hrs.Now Orileys shipped items and I see delivery 12/10 sometime before 9:pm.A out for delivery on tracking but at 5:pm tracking shows delivery 12/11 before 9:pm.Fullashtthis company is as bad as azzmazon.12/11 3:35 still nothing"
"Packages have been showing up in bad condition or not showing up ,I became a premium user and they billed me twice ,unable to dispute transaction tell payment authorized threw bank ."
"Used UPS due to size of package and no one else would take it. I paid £50.00 delivery, including insurance, printed out label and waited for it to be collected on the arranged day from my home.
Day came but UPS dis not so I phone them and was told that the driver had gone to wrong address due to postcode error. So we arranged for next day.
Day came and driver turned up early, good job so far, only then he said I had to pay another £4.01 before the scanner would accept package. He had no idea what the charge was for and, as I needed the package sent I had no choice but to pay.
So the package went and was delivered to the buyer the next day... Great job there then.
I was billed on my card for the delivery and that was end of transaction... or so I thought.
A week later and I noticed a fresh UPS charge on my card for £94.48 ... which they had taken without reason or authorisation from myself. I have had to freeze the card so they do not try and take any more.
I have no idea what this charge os and am in process of finding out.
I will never use UPS again as they have basically stolen money from my card without reason and are not willing to explain why.
So it cost me nearly £150 to send a package across country.... it would have cost me less to fill up my fuel tank and deliver the package myself ....
UPS fail to deliver on their promises and then steal your money for the privilege.
Fraud is the word I would use for their actions in my experience."
"I had a package (a plant) from CA to GA shipped via UPS. This usually takes 2-5 days with USPS (US Postal Service) depending on weather, express, etc. This UPS box would depart from a facility, arrive 12 hours later at the SAME facility, then departed again to travel another 10 hours to go from Atlanta to another facility only 30 minutes away and in the OPPOSITE direction! After another 12hrs sitting in a warehouse, it departed and went back to Atlanta! Finally, it was sent PAST my address to Jacksonville, FL! Then BACK to Georgia... this is just wasteful on time, money,.employees, gas!"
"Absolutely brilliant! I have used UPS about 4-5 times now. I wasn’t expecting great things to be honest because I’d had bad experiences with so many courier services but they are easy to use, good price, quick to deliver and the product has arrived in perfect condition. I have dropped parcels off at local location and yesterday arranged a collection in Belfast and parcel arrived in Dublin this morning!! I’m super impressed."
Delivered to wrong address. Not even next door. Thank goodness we have good neighbours.
"Just the worst - I sent a package from the UK to the USA, but I made a mistake on the address. I called them to ask if they could change as it wasn't yet out for delivery. They assured me that they had changed. I then called 2 further times, each time they told me that there was no note of me calling to change the address. I just found out that the package has been delivered to the wrong address. Just no point having a customer service option..."
"I ordered some natural health products from Costco, and the order took TWO FULL WEEKS to reach, and when I contacted them while waiting, the customer ""support"" representative said that the package was in a nearby warehouse inside one of their trucks. When the package finally reached the box was so hot as if it came right out of a furnace! and the products were consumable health products that should be kept in cool and dry storage place! It was the worst exprience I've ever had with a courrier. The worst management ever. Never again. If you're a business manager and you care for the reputation of your business deal with another courrier."
"I Ordered a clock from Amazon, but also recently moved. UPS could not find the address in there system so they changed the delivery address to the old address. Instead of phoning me, they sent the clock back to Amazon. Very poor service!!!!"
"UPS says they delivered the package. Package was not found anywhere on the intended delivery site property. Called UPS Service and got a robo voice. Totally useless. Tried to file an online Claim, which is the only way UPS accepts Claim filings. UPS online Claim filing is a horrendous nightmare! Unbelievably unfriendly user site. I finally gave up. So, goodbye to a $73 gift. Guess UPS wins this one."
"I used UPS through Parcelhero. It was for the return of an office chair of 7kg of weight. Parcelhero says that UPS audited my parcel and the weight was 112 kg 8bdtead of 7 which was just ludicrous. They charged my paypal account for 95 pounds!
Every time I contacted UPS regarding this case to help me with this fraud not only I haven't received any help but immediately after contacting UPS there has been an action taken by parcelhero, either an email or the charge of my account. This is all very strange."
"UPS is so bad. They keep telling me my package is going to be here the next day and then after I check again they say it will be here next week. Then a week goes by and the same thing. I ordered things after this, being shipped from the same place, that have already been delivered from fedex when I ordered them almost two weeks after. if you want to not get your package on time and when you are told you would have it then I recommend going with UPS. If you like to order things and forget about them for two months and be suppressed when it gets thrown on your doorstep with no caution then I recommend UPS. This is the first review I have ever written in my entire life but UPS is so bad that I made an account just to write this review. If I could give zero stars I would."
"What a useless stinking lie stupid dumb inhuman scamming company. I pray they get shut down deceivers how would they like to be treated the way they treat people? They lie about doing attempted delivery and keep reschedule delivery!
Avoid like the plaque they are no good. They need to be EXPOSED on RIP of BRITAN. They are useless. No order no priority happy to take your money yet they fail to deliver services. They are heartless cold. They will keep reschedule your parcel until. They come up with the biggest scam they will say they lost your parcel in transition it's not they want just steal your parcel. Please I'm warning newbies who never used UPS avoid like plaque there evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Worst services, even after repeated requests over call they haven’t even sent a notification of package status. Package is simply being redirected to access point some where a mile away.
They confirms it’s available at access point but access point member says it’s yet to arrive in there.
After this much frustrations they won’t even feel the customer concern."
"Absolutely useless - I was hung up on, listened to a pre-recording message saying they were closed which was 30 minutes before their closing time, no response to emails - off shore call centres that got aggressive and we’re about as helpful as a fossilised deuce from a goat"
Ups in the nitro wv area is a joke my packages do not get delivered to my house they park and turn around in my driveway and take my stuff to wrong house across the street now I'm missing package and called ups said would send me a link for clam and didn't and I can't start one till I get a link in email it's ridiculous once get your money don't care says driver signed for it and left it and never saw on cameras and I was home really sad how little they care about your stuff
"An order sent on 22/Nov by UPS from Wetsuitoutlet/Watersportsoutlet haven't been received yet (9/Dec), and it's not possible to understand where it's now."
Tracking no 1Z4GY46T0400024011 Wow! Astounded by how bad these reviews are! Wish I’d read them before I was duped by UPS into believing that they would deliver a small package from Uk to Germany in one working day. Jacob I’m hoping you pull through and sort out my package for delivery tomorrow otherwise I will be taking this further. In future don’t incite people to enter into a contract with you that you can’t deliver upon .
"1Z677247YW00000000, where is this now, ups says it been in Lathrop 4 the last 3 days. THIS IS WHAT I ASKED, & COULDN'T GET AN ANSWER ! UPS SUCKS, ONLY COMPANY WORST IS USPS !!!!!!!!!!"
"So sad I cannot give a zero. UPS took it upon themselves to deliver my packages to a nearby access point. I have my preferences set to deliver to my home(isn't that what ship to home means?). I saw that three packages that were to be delivered to my home had been canceled, so I called support(good luck if you can even speak to a subhuman). While inquiring about these package; the rep claimed that the driver changed where packages would be sent. He claimed that delivery options had been changed back to my home address. I asked; "" Who gave the driver the authority to make any changes in the first place?"" As I was inquiring about the other two packages; the rep. seemed to get aggravated and raised his voice. I had to lower the Boom on him! He got right after that. Still not even certain that my packages will in fact be delivererd to my home (as he said). I just filed a claim, a week ago for a package, they claimed was delivered to my home. I received a voice message saying it was delivered. Who told them that?! The same driver who rerouted my packages? Absolute garbage. UPS, greedy and don't care. This is usually the downfall of an organization. I am also sick of having to talk to outsourced people! People still need jobs here too!"
"We are absolutely disgusted by the service we received from ups, firstly they say 3-5 days expedited international,which is a joke because it was in the uk for more than 7 working days, then when it got over to the US it got from Philadelphia to Texas in a day.
My son sent us a video of them unboxing it and to our shock all the contents had been removed and put back in upside down as well as being all bashed up.
If I’d wanted our parcel to be bashed like this we could have jumped on top of it ourselves,
They charged enough.
So buyer beware"
"Honestly really bad service. If I have to order something again and this is them they will deliver to me I will cancel my order.

Last year because of the deliverman didn’t do his job properly and delivered me on my door my package has been stolen in my building by someone.

Since yesterday I tried to receive my order. There were someone at my home but first things the guy tried to deliver to my neighbour and then apparently they haven’t label my adress properly. Today I have put the request to put my item at the concierge because I wasn’t at home. The deliverman once again very lazy just get to my home, saw they were nobody and didn’t take time to read on system that I have requested to be delivered in my concierge, he’s gone with my parcel.

I contacted the customer service very upset and they said that they will call the driver to attempt my delivery tonight but I’m pretty sure they won’t. Tomorrow I’m working and I had to request to be delivered in shop because I’m pretty sure I will have the same problem. I’m honestly pissed of this deliver man that they don’t their job properly, being paid for a horrible service !!! And the customer service doesn’t help at all a part of reading their part of apologise. Honestly I highly no recommanded ! Horrible company and Lazy people ! I want to raise complain For the driver for the bad job !!!"
"I will never use UPS again, I shipped over night three separate times, and all three times they were a different amount for over night, one was over 100.00, the last one was 58.49 from Phoenix to New York, they were three days late, when I finally decided to ask for my money back (since I let it slide the last two times), I called the place where I shipped from and they said they would start a claim, when I called back they told me to call UPS, when I called UPS they said it was to late to file a claim it had been 16 days and they told me they couldn’t do it after 15 days. What a joke. Never again."
UPS a NON Customer service company! My package was sent to their UK Tamworth hub then sent to their Stoke depot [further away from the delivery address] then sat in their warehouse for 9 days so far. No contact available via phone as it rings out and no visable uk email address that I can see. They are simply the worst courier company I have ever come accross and as there are many in the UK that takes some beating. There are NO acceptable Excuses [not even covid or lack of drivers]. If you are reading this and thinking of sending any packages via UPS then go back to good old Parcel Force as you will at least be able to speak to someone.
"I paid £110 to send a parcel by UPS to be delivered to my brother in Barcelona on Tuesday, it was next day delivery service. I been through hell with this company they. Today is Thursday still no-one knows when it will be delivered. I have made about 20 calls and my brother in Spain been chasing the parcel by phone calls an emails, however, still one person refers us to someone who is much more incompetent than themselves. I am really frustrated and don’t want anyone else go through this."
"Don't expect anything to get better as global communism rolls out. This company is an abysmal failure. The company I ordered from says that they have issues with them as well, said they don't update their information properly. You see, with all the money that spent toward technology, things still suck. The only reason they are advancing technology is for the transhuman agenda and to enslave us within smart cities as part of Agenda 21. And their jab is nothing more than a genocide. F the whole system."
"It appears, after two days trying, that there is no way to contact a human for support. None of the automated tools have helped."
"Had a package dealer from the US was expecting it on Wednesday got a notice on the door that duties where done . There was no emails or text with a bill and number to call so I could pay . Call 1 800 number pay bill the following day the warehouse called to tell me that the bill needed to be payed .informed the person that the bill had been pay still waiting for the delivery.
Kirk Maver😔"
"i paid 20 euros for a delivery that comes from germany and i live in belgium! YES BELGIUM!! right across the frontier, for a SHITTIE service that delay the progress saying ""we have the wrong address, sorry for the inconvenience"" SORRY MY AASS! who pays 20 euros for a delivery that comes from a country near by?? exactly NO DAMM ONE!! only people that are desperate and wants a ultra express delivery for the next day or the same day!! paying 20 euros for a standard delivery , at least this RIDICULOUS company needs to do is a proper delivery respecting their costumer. and even if it was free delivery!! doesn't matter!! the costumer is the preference and that must always be respected!
this is a worldwide law."
"I have called UPS a number of times to try and pay (yes, pay) for tax that was added to my parcel. It's impossible to get through, with hold times of up to 30 minutes. Next thing I knew, I received a letter from a debt collector agency. So much stress and time to try and get this sorted, and still no results. It's been months now."
"Terrible, Terrrible servis!!!!! Worst from all couriers!! Avoid if you can. They damaged half of my order. After that I told them that I will pickup my package anyway because it was just 7 km from me. But they told me that it is not possible to pick up it and I need to wait. After one week of waiting I called them again and they told me that they dont know where the package is. After few days they told me that the package was sent to another city and they repacked it. After that I was finaly able to pickup it myself. When I opened the package the half of the order was missing. And they put some strange damaged bottles with some strange detergent which was also leaking into other half of the package. Also they putted dirty stinky plastic bag inside package. It was so terrible I even cant believe."
My package is stuck in China and I don't know how this company manages to make money since the service is so messed up. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD move the damn package.
They don’t f deliver on time they say it’s going to come that day and comes a whole week later
I ordered a phone from Verizon. It was shipped on 11/29/2021. I have received five different shipment dates. The latest one yesterday said it would now come today 12/8/2021 by 9 o’clock p.m. it is 9:15 PM and of course the package is not here. The irony is the UPS facility where delivery comes from is 12 miles from my house. At 7 o’clock this morning it says it was loaded on a truck at this UPS. So my question is if you loaded the package on the truck 12 miles from my house why has it taking (so far) 11 days to deliver the package? This is the worst possible service on God’s green earth. And contacting customer service is a bigger joke.
"What a nightmare. I sent a Christmas package to my daughter and realized after 2 hours of dropping the package off that the address was incorrect. I called the store I dropped it off at within 2 hours after dropping off and they could not help me. I then spent 4+ hours on the phone to the drop off site and UPS customer service + another visit to the store, and called the store where I was put on hold for 20 minutes with no one getting back to me so I hung up and tried to call back for 1.5 hours with no one answering the call. Many many calls to the 800 customer service with no help like I can change the address but I can't change the UNIT #. Really, if someone moves the unit number remains the same??? REALLY??? Also 1 person wanted to charge me $7.99 to hold the package but then reduced it to $5.99 and then said my card was rejected? I then asked for a supervisor who was able to fix the problem after another visit to the shipping site and 4+ hours on the phone. GREAT, except when I got off the phone I had received a text from my credit card company that a $7.99, charge from UPS for holding my package delivery was pending on my account after being told my credit card was denied and the supervisor getting the address changed. REALLY, A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY CAN'T DO A SIMPLE ADDRESS CHANGE INCLUDING USING THEIR ""MY CHOICE ACCOUNT""
WHAT A FORKING NIGHT MARE. I WILL NEVER EVER USE UPS FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE. A MINUS 10 RATING

."
Lousy delivery. They don't honor delivery day on tracking. No one at 800 number knows anything either. No time perameters are in place. Strictly amateur hour. Amazon is the only reputable Del company out there and can give you an accurate time.
"I'm sure it's a tough job and even tougher during the holidays. There are a lot of variables that affect the actual delivery. I get it.

That said, they routinely and logistically fail at shipping. Unfortunately for everyone else, the logistics of shipping is their 1 job.

Anytime I've ever had an issue with an Amazon delivery or any other places, UPS was shipping. I'd take a bet on everyone at UPS agreeing with me that paying to have your time wasted is not a good thing.

Dear Big Baller Bezos,

Thanks for everything except UPS involment. Please just have Amazon purchase UPS so they can be less bad if you insist on forcing it.

Thx"
"The service provided has been diabolical. I returned a package to Germany over 3 months ago and not only has it not left the country, it has now been lost.

I’ve been on the phone for hours on an abundance of occasions and have either been lied to, had the phone put down when “transferred” or received incorrect information.

They’ve been hopeless from start to finish and multiple staff advised me that there is no way to complain, which I do not believe.

I will never use UPS again and can’t wait to get this resolved so I don’t have to contact them ever again.

This is the first negative review that I’ve posted (at 33 years old) as I’m so frustrated with them."
I don’t understand how a ups worker can deliver my package to the wrong address but not only that you let the person sign for it and we have different last name.Then when you file a claim it’s like they can’t help you.Need to do better
"Beyond dissapointed! Avoid. I took a day off work for them to pick up my parcel- no one arrived, no communication from them. They do not respect their clients and their time. Will deffo not have my xmas parcel deliver on time for my family now as I can see no one there cares about them not fullfilling their promises. I would never recommend them to anyone."
Really bad experience... to avoid
The UPS store in Batavia ny is really good. I shipped a package they did it right but it was lost. The corporate office is doing nothing but the local store in Batavia ny is doing everything they can to make it right. I appreciate the feedback and the help but the main hub of UPS is now saying they are not even going to look for the package.
Will not use them again they mark delivered for 3 packages and one of them needed to be signed the email stated signed by delivery driver and none of the packages were left at all now how you loose that many packages
That UPS in Augusta is full of !!!!. They need to get people who know how to read in that office and truck loaders. How in the hell y’all lose a package from the roller to the truck. Because them MF can’t freaking read. Get Educated.
"UPS used to be my go-to delivery company. Where did it all go wrong? It used to be that I could book a parcel at 09:00, a uniformed driver in a UPS liveried van would turn up at about 11:00 and cheerily take my parcel, put it carefully in the back of the van, and it would be delivered next day. But something has gone badly wrong at UPS. Time before last it was a guy in jeans and T-shirt in an anonymous van who lobbed my parcel into the back of the van (I watched through the living room window as it described an arc in through the open door of the van). Still arrived next day though, thank you. This time I booked a parcel in the evening for next-day collection, and the driver didn't turn up at all. I tried to log in to the tracking service on ups.com and all I got was ""Access Denied. You don't have permission to access /lasso/login on this server."" What do you do with that? So I rang up UPS and did get through to an actual living person (good) after a three or four minutes, who told me that my ""job"" had been despatched to the driver but that the driver hadn't done that pick up (yes, I know that) and no they don't know why. Luckily it is a competitive market and there are other courier companies around."
"My recent experience is a NIGHTMARE. Only part of my orders have shown up, but it says that they have been delivered. I’ve been trying to talk to someone at UPS about this, but it’s impossible to reach a person. Everything is automated. My guess is that there are probably a lot of unhappy customers snd nobody wants to deal with them. Their website isn’t accepting my information to file a complaint. My only alternative is to drive to one of their stations so that I can complain to a living breathing human being…….unless they have automated services there lol"
Our UPS guy is the best. He brings the package to the door we use and always is the nicest. He knocks on the door so you know a package is there. Keep doing a good job.
"This company is an absolute, nightmarish joke. Every time I have to receive a delivery from UPS, something goes wrong. Today they didn't even try to deliver my package at my home, but instead took it to a delivery point 5 kilometers away without my consent or any notification. I only found out after tracking the order myself."
"Absolutely awful service.
Sent all necessary paperwork with package of perishable goods as a personal gift.
Received automated messages saying status of package changed. Resent the invoice.
No resolution and not even time frame for resolution.
Customer helpline is overseas the operators are not helpful.
Avoid at all cost."
I made an order through T-Mobile and T-Mobile gave the package to ups and they claim they left the package at my house but never did I receive the package. I called ups and they told me they were gonna send the driver to come and look for it and he says the package isn’t there anymore and when I called again they told me they couldn’t do anything. They didn’t send me a picture of when they sent the package nor did they have anyone sign to make sure it was delivered. Definitely don’t recommend them because they can’t even resolve a problem THEY made.
"This company is corrupt and will steal your money and lose your package. Their claims department is a hoax, and you will never see any of your insurance money on a package or your money back on your shipment. I wish I could give 0 stars."
"I wish I could give zero star. Lost package, just before Xmas. No help at all. Absolute useless company! I’m not a charity to give free presents for your drivers/warehouse staff. How on earth can a package disappear really…. Never ever use them!!!! 0"
"Sold an item on ebay and booked delivery by ebay packlink for collection by UPS. They never came so took it to the collection point. 3 weeks later parcel still not delivered, with difficulty I contact UPS they say I need to start a claim via a link through my UPS account. I dont have one so sign up for one but tracking no is not recognised as because it was booked via ebay. Contact UPS and again and have real diffuculty hearing what is being said as their micraphone level is set so low. This is a ploy along with keeping you on hold, timing out etc to stop you from contacting them. UPS should stand for ""Useless Parcel Service"" because that is what they are"
"How is this appalling company still in operation?

They sent me an SMS on Sunday to inform me that my package would arrive on Monday between 9.45 am and 1.45 pm. It's Wednesday and it still hasn't arrived. Furthermore, the UPS staff are clueless.

As customers, we deserve far better. Not only are UPS extraordinarily unreliable, it's almost as if they go out of their way to deceive and cheat us. Their customer service is abysmal too; you can expect more compassion from your satnav. A one-star review is too generous."
"Tried sending 1 letter with UPS.. FAILED (""UPS internal security measures prevent the processing of this shipment. contact UPS on 707..."")

Tried calling UPS.. FAILED (""Contact hours are from 9am - 12pm because of Covid)

Tried setting up an account.. FAILED (""Sorry, we're unable to process this request.."")

After wasting over an hour on this I can conclude UPS do not want my business and that I should simply give up and try a competitor."
Wonderfully reliable! Need I add more?!?...
"Continually re-schedules the delivery date. My package has been received by ups for over 2 weeks, no movement on tracking and every day I get an email saying that's it's going to arrive later. Avoid ups at all costs."
"In February I booked a shipment from Spain to UK of a document only. This got stuck in their system with customs depspite having the correct paperwork included. After more than 3 weeks this was returned to sender (judging by the reviews here it appears I should be grateful that it didn't end up permanently lost). As this was a document needed for travel the delay meant I got stuck in another country for weeks unable to return home. Incidentally a different courier DHL managed to ship this from Spain to UK in 2.5 days with no issues. Over the past 9 months I have emailed and called UPS to get my money back. I finally received a response this week after all previous emails being ignored. Incredibly they didn't actually read my email (with a summary I included for their ease). I was advised they couldn't find the tracking number on the system and asked to check with the sender if the shipment was sent?!?! I was intending to chase this until my money was refunded, but I give up now. The level of incompetence with this company is mind-boggling. I wonder how much money UPS are making from failing to refund customers for a service that has not been provided?"
"Seeing a lot of this in other reviews. They say package delivered but it's nowhere to be found. They used to be the best, now they are most definitely the worst. I have a camera and was home at the time of ""delivery"". They purposely make filing a claim the biggest damn hassle so you won't wanna bother. $60 pair of Duluth pants GONE. UPS Jackson, MI. 49203"
So if no one is at home the driver will leave the package at the front door. Shocking £260 pair of trainers gone missing. The r tea nerd have sold out and my daughter hasn’t a big present for Christmas. Steer clear guys and gals
"UPS drivers steal packages.

We had one package marked delivered. We looked at surveillance camera approximately duration of 1 hr from before and 1 hr after delivery time. Not a single person even came near the entrance of our building during the time.

Package was never delivered even though marked delivered. Its the darn drivers."
"Very Very Excellent Bad Service ,Customer services can t help,"
I believe EMPLOYEES stealing packages. Says my PACKAGE was delivered 3 days before it was due to arrive. I have front porch surveillance and NOT one UPS driver showed up. The worst delivery company ever!!!
"UPS is the single worst company I have ever done business with. You don't have to deal with their customer support too often, but if you ever do it will leave your blood boiling. For starters their website is extremely complicated to navigate for anyone who is not a shipping expert, yet if you talk to their reps on the phone they will reference you to a link on their site (usually incorrect) and quickly hang up without asking you if that is enough information to solve your problem.

It took me nearly 20 tries to get past their automated answering machine to actually speak with a rep and during this time I was furious that it too continuously hangs up on you unless you answer the questions exactly right.

Needless to say I oearned a valuable lesson about ups and in the future I will pay more to avoid using this service."
"If any villages are missing their id iots they are over their working at UPS. Got a notice my Apple computer could not be delivered because I was not at home and it required a signature. It would be left next UPS delivery day. GUESS WHAT???? You got it folks, next day no package. Spoke to the driver and she said she took it back to the office and left it with a supervisor. These people could not find their collective asses with maps and flashlights. Now nobody seems to know where my package is. OOOOH Apple and UPS have launched an 'investigation' so these rocket scientists say it will take at least 8 days to resolve where said package is."
The worst place ever they claim that they could not deliver my package because it was unsafe I live on the second floor of an apartment complex with a locked door that requires a code the second time they did not leave my package even though I told them to leave the package at the front door I got to I missed you sign when they were instructed to leave the package I have spoken with someone many times to tell them to leave the package at the front door I do not need to be there and they still do not leave the package it is over 5 days late this company is a POS.
"I was tracking my package, and seen it was at my local facility. I called trying to pick it up as it had just arrived there they told me no because it didn’t arrive at the facility yet. I went after work and asked again in person, the guy told me it was on their semi truck that had just arrived so my package would be delayed until the day as they hadn’t processed the truck yet. I got home and my package was sitting on my front porch. Tons of non sense and lies."
"Still waiting for my parcel to arrive for my autistic son. The first parcel got nicked and the second is now out for delivery but I was told that a week ago so I’m guessing nicked or lost again.. a month ago it was given to them to deliver! Every time I call I get fobbed off absolutely shocking
update just been told my second parcel has gone ""missing"" from the same depot as the first!!!!"
"Customer service is AWFUL. I spent over an hour trying to speak to someone to get a shipment cancelled so I could include another package in the shipment, and after speaking to four agents not a single one helped me. One sent me an email to a completely irrelevant issue and just hung up, another put me on hold for fifteen minutes and then hung up, none of them gave a damn about helping me out and just wanted to end the call as soon as possible. TERRIBLE. I'll be placing the $400 shipment with Fedex instead, sorry UPS couldn't be bothered."
"The UPS delivery person was late, then he lied and said I denied my package, then stated that the package was damaged. The customer service kept saying ""I"" denied my package. I spoke to a person that stated they will stop my delivery from going back to the sender and they lied. They never notated the account. Request a supervisor to find out that it was placed as damaged. Sent me to the damage department and he stated that the man placed it as damage but there is no damaged report done. He told me that he could not notate the account because I am not the sender. I said if the sender call there will be no notes, he stated that they had to wait on a damage report. I said, it was reported yesterday and there is no report, he says no. The worse customer service ever!!!!"
3 days delay on my order.. so bad!
"Not happy with ups will never use again!awful experience from start to finish. Recently booked expedited shipping with UPS for a bike shipment. There was a large hole in box when received with part of my bike sticking out. Collection was missed had to chase and call ups to collect. Quoted 500 euro on system for expedited post to Canada from ireland delivery took 8 days. Extra charges were put on top of bill when received package one for 51 euro for a large package surcharge one for peak surcharge residential 38 euro , one for 59 euro for peak surcharge large package. Such day light robbery for an expedited service that I did not get!! Website says expedited post 3-4 days delivery or your money back !!! Awful experience. They also added extra centimetres to the size of box to charge more. Even though I have the box and still measured the same as when I measured when booking. What a rip off."
"My sister used UPS to send an important family document to me. (HUGE mistake) She chose the ""sign for"" option- Which only protects the package from porch pirates not from incompetent and/or dishonest employees- and that's how it started. The package went from her town in Alabama with no issue through Mississippi, then ended up at a processing center in Houston. (The Willowbrook processing center. ) It scanned in to the processing center, then scanned onto a truck. Later that evening, the truck scan ""disappeared"". I'm not saying that they stole it, maybe they just threw it away? When I called ( that was a cryptic mess ) they would only read the current displayed electronic trail , naturally I took screen shots of it because I know UPS. So I had the data from when it scanned into a truck. They were unable to find it and issued a refund for the delivery charge ( minus the family document that cannot be replaced ) .
DO NOT USE ups. If your package is truly important to you. DO NOT BUY from companies that ship with ups if your delivery is important to you. Perhaps ups should spend more time investigating and qualifying the criminal background of it's employees rather than pushing Marxist union agendas."
"Ridiculous, trying to return an order from a retailer with a prepaid return label. Booked for collection between 9-1…no one came so I called and was told ‘there is no record of this collection’. I had received both an email and text confirmation of the date and time, so I find that hard to believe.

Had to rebook the collection for the following week. Stayed in all day, again no one came. Called customer service and was told ‘someone will contact you’. Surprise surprise, no one did so I had to call again. Then was told ‘no one is coming to collect it today’

Absolutely ridiculous to stay in for two days and to have no one come, no communication, no apology, nothing. Why offer a collection service and provide confirmation if it can’t actually be done??

Have decided to give up and take it myself to a drop off point which will involve me lugging a heavy box half a mile away on foot but honestly, that will be less infuriating than waiting in for yet another collection that probably won’t happen.

Avoid if you can and if you have a return, I suggest you take it to a drop off point rather than relying on someone actually coming to pick it up."
"This company is totally Tommy Tank, Had a parcel that could not be delivered even though they had the correct address recited to the absolute Hampton Wick on the phone 20 times....

The few words I can think that even describe this s**t company are.

Crap, manure, dung, excrement, lousy, atrocious, p*ss, careless, crummy, awful, useless.... feel free to add to the list in another review.

People need to be made aware that this company is terrible."
"Lost package, spent hours trying to contact UPS. Phone numbers didn’t work or gave wrong information. If you did get through, lines were so bad you couldn’t hear what was being said. Live chat wasn’t helpful. On the phone it was finally admitted the package was lost (after a week) it was up to me to sort it out with the seller to make a claim against them.
Disgraceful service."
"REALLY BAD
Its a waste of energy and time to even complain about them, I really hope this company will crumble soon."
"How can you be so bad at what you do?

Every modern delivery business offers the recipient to choose when delivery takes place and provides web services to take in vital information such as door codes.

Your UPS My choice is a mess of broken links, bad interfaces and ultimately can't connect parcel to recipient no matter the effort I put in.

I still have to manually call in to ensure that you get my door code and even then - even then your driver turns around as soon as he sees an apartment and doesn't bother to check your system for door code.

I call your support and the employee asks me to hold and never comes back.

I call your support again and when I tell him about the problems he says that I should ask to have my parcels delivered to a collection place far away if I want to have my parcels delivered reliably. You are so #$$$$ bad at delivering parcels I want to punch something.

And when I wait on the line to at least leave the feedback on my experience, even that does not work and the feedback service dies before I can deliver feedback.

Every #$#$ time I wait at home only to be disappointed again.

No one has ever been so bad at doing something as this sad excuse for a company. I can't believe your grade is 1.2. That means someone on this earth thought your service was worth a 2. Did you have your mom give you a rating?"
"My parcel is delayed with 2 weeks. After leaving UK and getting in Germany I received from UPS 2 delivery dates (and off course it was not delivered on those dates) and now it says that ""A delivery date will be provided as soon as possible"". Customer service are rubbish, some of them said that everything is ok and will be delivered, other say that it was release from Customs and it is about to be delivered next day, other say that it is in their store in Germany and yet it was not delivered.
Even the receiver contacted them twice by email and twice by the phone and gave all the needed details to finalize delivering it and UPS keep saying that the Receiver did not contact them.
I personally sent them at least 7 emails and contacted them by phone more than 8 times and they always say the same thing ""the parcel will be delivered, everything is ok, you and the received do not have to do anything, just wait for it"".
I tried to call in Germany myself and they do not answer the phone...I have been waiting in the phone in the queue for 1 hour each time and nobody answered.
UPS is rubbish. Even when you try to make a claim their website blocks you, it is made in a way to block you doing it. You cannot add the account details because the account nr. is longer than they allow on the website. UPS is a legal & accepted FRAUD COMPANY."
Greedy and unethical company. What they portray to the public is a facade. They put their own interests above all else including employees and customers.
Never collected parcel but never refunded.There should be 0 stars for companies like this
"The worst delivery experience. Delivering during daytimes with no means to change because the website is ""experienced technical difficulties"" (it has been so for weeks). I had to phone AND PAY for the communication to get it changed, but lo and behold, they can't change delivery hour, simply day. Changing the delivery address to another I will be. The very next day when I track, I see ""delivery address incorrect. Returning to sender"" Oh you gotta be kidding me. The managers and IT service should use their own service to see the pain."
"Do not use a password
I spend more than one hour about a password for UPS. I had two accounts. Both: password wrong????? Set up new user I’d and so on
Everything was confirmed.
Now I try to use. Surprise!!! Password wrong, although it is stored in my passwords
So advise: do not use UPS"
absolutely the worst carrier to carry your things. I have had 3 packages lost from UPS within 3 weeks. this is awful. Delivery drivers will not try to find your house. They will stick it in anyone else mail box just to say they delivered it.
Didn't even attempt delivery. Delivered to nearest local store instead. Highly unprofessional.
"If I could give a zero star rating I would. I was supposed to have received a package on December 2nd, and it is now Monday December 6th and I still haven't received my package. I am supposed to be here at home to sign for this package, which means I have had to take off from work in order to get it. Thursday, the first day I waited but no show! I did receive a message that evening that their was a delay and I would receive my package on Friday. So I stayed home on Friday and waited all day. I called UPS at about 5p.m., and was told my package would be delivered between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. It was another no show. I got another message on Saturday that my package would be delivered on Monday. I didn't want to wait around all day and evening again so I called UPS again at about noon and spoke to a representative who told me my package would be delivered today, but couldn't give me an approximate time. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 28 minutes before the line clicked and I was hung up on. I called back and finally got in touch with a supervisor after 44 minutes. She started off speaking nicely, but her tone turned ugly. All she could do is say that my package would be delivered today before 6 p.m. She tried to tell me in so many words that she was empathetic, but the tone of her voice said otherwise. After all was said and done, I realized I will never use UPS for another delivery again. I hope this review will make a difference for someone out there."
Everytime I get a ups delivery or one of my neighbors since we live in an apartment I literally watch the ups driver walk up to the outside door put a sticky note on it saying they tried to contact but never do. They never deliver the packages or try!!!! They did it to me today again for the 2nd time. I will never use ups again.
"1st time: I had a package from outside USA and ups notified me that it was placed in my front porch. I kept checking and there was none, i called , emailed ups and they kept me going in circles. Decided to contact the vendor and they issued a re-shipment, this time it was sent to a pickup center. I finally got this time.
2nd time:i ordered from the same vendor, sent to a pickup point. Ups gave me a notice that it was delivered already. When i checked the place, they said the ups guy didnt show up today. How in the world can that happen. Tried contacting UPS, they kept me in circles. Now i have to make a claim again. What a mess this ups is!"
"Hidden fees

Hidden fees everwhere

Took multiple calls with Customer Support just to drop fees they insisted I wouldn't have to pay since the start"
"My fiancé worked two weeks for UPS and they never put in his punches. He went to work today and was told, ""I gave your route away and hired six new people."" Is this there gimmick? Work people to death and then not pay them and hire different people for two more weeks and then screw them??? Quad Ave DONT GO THERE!!"
"This parcel origniated in Italy, containing special low-carb Italian biscuits for a diabetic child, and a Panettone.

Only three days ago the UPS system merrily announced by email that:

""Your parcel is on the way!
Estimated Delivery
Tuesday 07/12/2021
End of Day""

Today, on tracing the parcel, I find that the progress report says:

""The receiver did not present proper identification containing the delivery address. / The package will be returned to the sender.""

...Only 'the receiver' (me) has been in all day and NOBODY has tried to deliver a parcel!

What's more, when I spoke to Customer Support, they told me they can do nothing because the parcel has not even left Italy!
So HOW did ""the receiver not present the correct documentation?...""

The CSR told me to contact the sender, so she spoke to UPS Italy, who told her that the parcel was not sent ""because she did not insert the correct Fiscal Code""

BUT nothing on the shipping form ASKED for a Fiscal Code, so she could not have done so

So EITHER the UK end is lying or the Italian one is, they cannot have it both way!

Poorly paid, overworked staff is lying to cover-up their mistakes, because greedy UPS Corp. will not hire enough staff, ensure they have a manageable workload and pay them a decent wage, with suffcient breaks!

*** A B Y S M A L *** UPS!
ABSOLUTELY VILE!
SORT YOURSELVES OUT!

UPDATE The parcel is now back in Italy, at the sender's address, who will be using the poistal service from now on.

Neither she nor I will be using UPS again ,for this or any other deliveries, national or international.

REALLY NOT IMPRESSED!"
"Delivery messy, and this is not the first time!
No messages when the parcel arrive in parcel shop, UPS brings it back because the shop is overloaded, takes 20 min on the phone to make a claim, but no message when the parce pops up in the shop."
"This company are useless! Sent me an email detailing where they had delivered my package to..turned out to be a young family home. Phoned them and they confirmed another address, complete with signature, but when I went to collect they had never seen the package. UPS then sent an email saying they had no idea where it was and couldn't guarantee it had been sent to the hub...nothing but lies!!!"
"The worst possible delivery company in the whole world. Please, do not put any delivery with them. Rescheduling the delivery for 4th time and the warehouse is 15 mins from home."
UPS sucks. My package is tracked to be at a processing center about 20 minutes away from my location. Now for some reason it’s 3 days late.
Delivery was quick. However I would have preferred if the delivery man had waited for an answer at the front door or put the package in the porch rather than outside.
Horrible. Just horrible. Tried to cancel a package delivery 3 times to my old address in a different state and they delivered it anyway. So this package will come up stolen and they will be responsible. Don’t make any sense to me whatsoever.
"The worst courier imaginable, lied about
How many times they said they were unable to deliver, lied for three days saying my item was on the van,then sent it back to manufacturers even though I tried to pick it up from them for the three days.post office,Dpd,Hermes NEVER UPSucks"
"Had a delivery comprising of 6 items. I received 5 and the other 1 was delivered to a completely different TOWN to an address not even similar to mine. Only found out because the person who received it was nice enough to get hold of me!
If that wasn't bad enough, most of my other deliveries from UPS are either delayed heavily, have been opened and had parts stolen from them, or do not even come at all!
Kiss my @ss UPS."
"The worst customer experience I have ever received.
This company is clearly treating their employees badly as I have never experienced such universal bad treatment. They seem to have no idea what is going on, parcels constantly being held and delayed, people giving conflicting information and I am constantly being hung up on when trying to find out where my parcel is."
"The Shittest company ive ever ever dealt with
Posted blank “sorry we missed you card” no details of tracking no. & the i fo notice no. Does nothing but not work
The websites impossible
The phone line is awful
They wont tell you whos used their service to send u the goods
Absolutely frustrating and a joke
DONT USE THIS SERVICE BOYCOTT UPS
all it says on there is we will try next business day & doesnt even give specific hours im beyond annoyed"
Really bad service and fake customer service
"Delivery comes a day earlier than the confirmed date last week and I am not present to receive it - so it goes to a pick-up location.

The person at the pick-up location says he never received the parcel, UPS employees have no clue how to locate the package, no one answers e-mails, you call them and they tell you they will call you back which never happens, I keep rearranging my week according to this parcel to arrive (if ever)."
"Absolutely ridiculous service. Overcharge you a hefty ""import fee"", brings the package right up to your doorstep, tells you that you can't pay with card and buggered off with your package."
I've used UPS for ten years and they have only once let me down. The service is very good. Most of the operators are helpful.
"Only one delivery attempt which failed because nobody was home (no contact by courier service to establish if someone would be home or not). Then despite calling three different times to explain I have no vehicle to pick up the large package myself from the pick up point, no further attempts were made. Eventually CarpetVista had to send the same package out a second time at which point we received it promptly. Conclusion: Delivery eventually successful but not great by any stretch of the imagination. Just to be clear this is UPS Italy with whom my experiences on the whole have been bad."
SUREPOST PART OF UPS SUCKS SO BAD I HATE IT THEY ARE NEVER EVER NOT ONCE ON TIME
"Unexplainable UPS government charges
Importing a shipment from the UK to Denmark.
Sent with UPS from the UK, arrived with Interparcel/UPS here in Denmark.

I paid GBP 50 for the (old and broken) thing in the UK and GBP 40 for shipping.

Then came the expected bill from UPS;

1. VAT DKK 36 (I expected this)
2. Brokerage Charges DKK 145 (UPS collection fee = I expected this)
3. Government Charges DKK 552 (GBP 63) (I did NOT expect this!)

I of course called UPS customer service.
They couldn't tell me, what the ""government fees"" are, that they collect.

They sent me on to their import office.

I then spoke to the import office, and they didn't know what it was either, - but took a guess at it being a fee collected for the government due to its name.

They told me to contact the danish authorities.

I then called danish customs, which handles all import VAT, fees, taxes, duties etc.;
They only collect the VAT (in this case DKK 36 = a few euros).
The DKK 145 collection fee goes to the UPS for collecting the VAT on behalf of the danish authorities.
All fine so far and all normal.
The danish authorities can't tell me what the ""Government charges"" are for.
It's certainly not money that goes to them and they were, quite frankly, baffled to hear about this charge.

""UPS must be able to tell you what it is for"", was their response. ""You must ask them"".
Well, I already did that, but UPS wasn't able to tell me what this rather huge amount of money is for.

I then emailed UPS and asked them again.
Clearly, they collect the money so they must know why and what for.
They responded with a Case#.
But I never heard back from them.

Googling the ""UPS Government charges"" only adds to the confusion and frustration.
Apparently, the ""Government charges"" is a self-invented fee based on whatever UPS feels for that day, that UPS charges on shipments going to and from the UK after Brexit.
But, despite its name, these ""Government charges"" is not money that goes to any government, but to UPS.
At least UPS cannot explain what the money is for and where it goes.

I'm afraid this marks the end of using UPS for me."
I ordered a package back in early November I have never gotten an update nor any information of where my package is I do not recommend using UPS if I was allowed to I would give it a negative rating
"F you you f'ing f's! I've hand deliveries from Amazon, USPS, FedEx, DHL all over the last month, none of them have f'd up. I've had five different f ups from you. You guys suck the biggest fattest diks in the whole f'ing world. Please take your brown f'ing logo pull it out of your f'in a$$hole and shove it down your f'ing throats."
"With-all-due respect the UPS service SUCKS! Worst delivery service ever! I think they only deliver where it is at their convenience. So if you live a little off their route guess what? They will go in that direction only if at least five of your neighbors have used UPS as well. The tracking website shows ""out for delivery"" but in reality, your stuff is held in a UPS store and you don't know it. I wish retailers learn from those reviews and stop using the UPS entirely!"
If I could leave 0 stars I would. Twice this week I have had packages delivered to the wrong house but both times claiming it was dropped off at the correct location even after knowing I have cameras on both driveway and front porch. First time was told package was left at garage....... I dont have a garage. Second time states they left it at the front door with 4 people home and not 1 person seen them drop it off nor are they on camera dropping anything off! UPS refused to go get the package just went off drivers word that they delivered it to the correct address. Smh. I'm sure with it being the holidays they are most likely keeping packages. After seeing all the bad reviews it makes me wish we could pick who delivers our packages when we order online because UPS would not be my choice. Fedex and USPS have had no issues dropping my packages off at my house! Custmer service is a joke and does nothing to retrieve packages. Also if you need to speak to a live person then reach out to corporate but they arent any better. They also say they are working on refunding your money when you file a claim but fail to actually refund your money for the items they delivered to wrong house or possibly stolen! UPS is a scam.
"Poor services. Paid for a parcel to be delivered. They tried 1st time, could have drop the parcel through big window of the fron porch, instead they took the parcel to a collection point. I have tried to rearrange for redelivery but even after 1 week there were no updates on my tracking nr., had to waste my time and money on the road to get that parcel by myslef from the collection point.
So why you were paid for UPS, where is the delivery service for that price please.
Very disappointed"
"My step mom took a package into Orange City UPS to be securely repackaged for added protection to be sent to me here in Michigan. She paid the shipping, added another box and inner packaging contents, and paid extra for UPS to pack it for her. She put extra insurance on it, because it was something that my deceased mother had made, and is irreplaceable. Suppose to be mailed out on November 15th and I should have received around the 18th of November. Guess What ???? Nothing yet. Checked the tracking number for days, and all it said was label created. Finally called Orange City UPS and the lady transferred me to a guy who said he would pass on the information to the distribution center that picked it up from the store. Waited several more days …… Nothing. Finally called the Corporate number. What a joke. Must go to a foreign location, because every one had broken English and was hard to understand, or they couldn’t understand what I was trying to get across to these call center employees! Ugh! I had to call corporate twice. First service complaint employee said it was sitting in Michigan in Cass City . So I called there…… automated system and I put in tracking number. Says no information? Called corporate again, this time got someone I could understand better. She basically said to file a claim. I said wait a minute…. Shouldn’t you put a tracer on the package?? Well it’s December 4th, and still no information on it and I never did get a call from the Orange city UPS or the distribution center that supposedly picked it up on November 15th. I have lost all confidence in UPS and will never ship something that is sentimental ever again with their service."
"How can a company with more than 90% bad reviews still exist????
Worst delivery company in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Over two months both perishable items from a vendor who started recently to use UPS. first time, two months ago, I was waiting and waiting and waiting, after few days I have used the UPS tracker and was showing as parcel damaged. It took nearly two weeks for them to confirm the incident to the vendor, so I could have the order sent again. The vendor offered me a discount voucher for further use.
This month, bought again from them and to my surprise the parcel was again sent with UPS. Now, UPS declared that the parcel was delivered to me, but the parcel wasn't delivered at all. No photo of the delivery and I was told that I have to investigate myself, or ask the vendor to do it, because as far as their concern it was delivered.
Wouldn't recomend to anyone!!!!"
"Ups notified me “my package was delivered” - only it wasn’t!! We were here, we have a camera - no one came to the door. Then I tried 15 times to call “customer service” - stuck in logic loop all calls ended with “sorry we can’t connect you with an agent” then hang up. This is fraud!"
"I live in a condo complex. Every door is clearly labelled to indicate which units are in that building. More often than not, my packages are left in the wrong building and I have to go from building to building to search for my package. Either the delivery person is too lazy to READ the clearly posted unit number or doesn't care. UNACCEPTABLE"
"My parcel is supposed to ship from Finland to Singapore. Yet it has to pass by Estonia, Latvia, Germany, China due to errors and delays before it reaches here eventually based on the tracking system. The original delivery date is supposedly to be on Friday.. it was then postponed to Saturday with no parcel in sight. Now the customer service is asking me to wait for a new expected delivery date on a Sunday as they have no answers when the new delivery date will be and whether the parcel can be delivered on time without further delays. UPS has a lot to catch up in terms of service delivery. Avoid UPS if possible!"
"Expected delivery between 12.00 and 16.00 so went out in the morning and was home by 11.30 to find a notice stating they'd tried to deliver at 11.10 and had taken the parcel to a collection point. If I'd wanted to collect, I wouldn't have paid for service. Finally managed to negotiate terrible website to change delivery back to home address and haven't had a new estimated delivery time 36 hours later. Awful website, can't talk to a human, just not good enough."
"Avoid like plague. In the last few months, all my packages were delivered late, some were delayed by 2 days. The worst part is that on the day of delivery, the tracking always showed that package will be delivered ""by the end of day"" however they never arrived on time. I have wasted so much time waiting for the package. UPS should learn lessons from companies like DPD and DHL who almost always deliver on time."
Dogsh** service!!!! Delivery driver sat in his truck and called the office to tell them that I'd wanted to pick up my package at their holding location. Like that makes any damn sense when I've been waiting for my package all day. Now they they've called multiple times to confirm where I live like ot isn't on the way bill. Then they tell me they're rescheduling my package to come AFTER THE WEEKEND WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE ON A THURSDAY!! Worst Delivery company ever!!!!!! UPS should be out of service!!
"I understand why there’s a delay going on.
My package showed up today! I ordered an MK purse and paid for the gift wrap.
The package has damage and including my gift wrap box has a hole in it! It has damage!! Very disappointing! I’m pregnant and almost wanna cry about this!"
Terrible service. Terrible experience. No notification of delivery. Time slot 9am to 18:30. Wasted a whole day without delivery! Option to pick up only at head office 12km away. They do not deserve the one star rating required to write a review and I rarely take time to write reviews!!!
"Never received package, keep asking me to check letterbox even though it is empty, correct address provided numerous times but still asks me to give address"
"Whenever businesses use UPS they default to signature delivery - every other delivery company can leave my packages without a signature but UPS comes to my apartment building, sees no one there, and then decides they cannot delivery a package (a package with minimal value as well)."
"Their driver left the pavement at our building and drove over a sprinkler pipe and damaged it, also causing a large leak that resulted in a high water bill. I have over $1500 in damages to my building and UPS has stalled and made excuses and lied about it for over 2 months. I am repeatedly told that I'll get a call back, or ""they'll talk to a manager"", but it never happens and I am stuck with the bill."
"I am so disappointed in this company! We sent a christmas gift from Spain to South Africa Worcester! Just to be told to pay a dispatch cost , more than the value of the gift plus the cost to send it! We will never use UPS again!"
"Stop charging customers for service that you don't provide. I paid 2nd Air delivery and it's delivered after 6 days which is not guaranteed either. Customers choose EXPRESS delivery for various reasons, we don't choose to pay extra just for the fun of it. Stop blaming COVID-19 for your laziness and crappy service. If you can't provide the service DON'T charge for it."
"Pathetic customer service.spent one hour explaining want to change address and not getting any help.
I asked them to connect me to manager , he said I sit next to the manager.this kind of replies we get from customer service"
"booked in 6 boxes to be delivered to Dublin Ireland and next day they picked them up and then the next day they delivered 5 boxes back to me and the 6th box they delivered to a random address in London
Will never ever use them ever again."
My review is all about the customer service call line. Should be easier to talk to a real person. Can't get any info if a package comes to the wrong location. Could be a neighbor's but oh well. Can't help them because I can't talk to a real person. Looks like it'll take longer for that person to get their possible Christmas present. Smh....
"Phone support refuses to connect to a real person, I spent numerous calls and I don't know how long trying every possible option. There online options can't solve my problem as it says the package was delivered to a UPS access point over 10 days ago, but it wasn't there that night, the next day, or the other two times I've checked since. The guy at the UPS store just shrugs and says ""Sorry, nothing I can do"". No one will give me more information."
They simple drop my item at a collection point and told me that I was not there to receive my item. Happened every time my sender used UPS. We should avoid any selling company uses UPS.
"Worst company ever. They just give problems and keep changing the story to avoid paying for parcels they loose.

Will never use it and will never recommend it. Don’t ever bother to use them. Full rubbish."
"I received the best service from UPS and it is worthy of reviewing! From Ireland to Canada in 48hrs for a saver delivery! I couldn't believe it. Even with the floods and major road disruptions, I still got my parcel on time like they promised! I will recommend UPS any day! Thank you!"
"I wish this was on just one instance but these guys, no matter where in the city (London), just lie that they couldn't find you; allow redelivery to be in a 5-6 days later than the original date, and force you to pick your parcel up from their location or usual drop off points. How I know? Because I have a ring doorbell, and used to have an intercomm connected to my mobile. This experience has happened maybe 5th or 6th time in two years. Lying pieces of rotten fruit..."
"I have a package that was supposed to arrive yesterday.I notice that I forgot to put my street address I tried to change it but it seems like I wasn’t Allowed to.My delivery date(the time)kept changing,I tried to track my package and it was written in transit or on the move(the status has stay that way no progress has been made).So I called ups at least three times and no one picked up the phone or has called me back yet.I tried calling,emailing,going to their website nothing has worked(no support nor help).my package is well past the estimated delivery Wich was yesterday. Keep in mind my package is light/small nothing that should be hard to ship or anything."
"My package suppose to be days away from me from Texas to Las Vegas Nevada, and you shipped it to NJ? You all must be a next level of stupid over there!!! Your service is trash and hate UPS! YOU OVERCHARGE FOR TRASH SERVICE!!!!"
"Another horrible UPS experience. I went to my front door to retrieve the package I was told just arrived, and it wasn't there. I went to the website and tried to file a claim.
I was told I couldn't do it and instead received a message saying I should call. I called, never got anyone to speak with, and was hung up on two times by the automated system, after being told to file a claim online. This is typical of the customer service they provide. I am going to start demanding that merchants pledge to use another carrier. If they don't I will take my business elsewhere."
"Is this comapny or financial pyramids?

Customer service is lying, but what can you expect from simpletons? a driver stole my package this company is totaly patho**** there are many other reliable companies but some people say that the fish rot from the head."
Wish I could give 0 stars! The customer service is so very terrible. The lady on the phone was rude and cut me off repeatedly. Didn’t care about the problem I was having. She definitely needs to be removed from this field. The only thing worse than her is automated systems the mail service has set up that can’t fix any problem. So if you got a busy schedule and you’re always on bad hours then you’re screwed if there is an issue with your package.
"We live in a small community of Canton Oklahoma. Our UPS driver comes out of Enid Oklahoma. He is the most courteous driver that has ever delivered to us. I do not know his last name but first name is Thomas. We have received many packages over the last month, he always comes to the door with a smile and a good afternoon sir or ma'am."
Said my parcel would be delivered tomorrow to my home address. So arranged to be at home that day and not today. Now got any “exception” notification that they tried to deliver it today but I wasn’t in so they have delivered it to a collection point the other side of my where I live. One delivery attempt on the wrong day Useless Parcel Service.
This company must have less than 1% on-time performance. I recently ordered a sling bag from the US to be shipped to Indonesia using UPS Worldwide Express. It's advertised that it can deliver in 1-3 business days. Well surprise it has been almost 2 weeks and I still haven't received my parcel. The estimated delivery date on my tracking page has changed at least 3 times! On top of that the shipping fee was quite expensive at about $19.99. I think their service doesn't justify the price I had to pay. Very unreliable and I'd strongly suggest you guys not to shop from online stores that deliver using UPS unless you want to have a bad experience!
"i would give a 0 if I could. I have had MANY bad experiences with UPS. The most recent (which has also happened before), the UPS tells me the recipient and address is wrong. IT is not wrong. My address. My name. As works with DHL, DPD, Hermes, etc. Then when I try to just pick the damn box up since they somehow cannot find me, I have to use their website.. which NEVER has let me log in, see my package, or change anything in delivery. A completely unuseable website. So now my pants will likely be sent back to the warehouse, because of UPS incompetence. Unreal"
"Oh boy. UPS is rubbish beyond all belief. The trustworthy brown truck and friendly drivers? How disappointing it is to tell you they're really really awful. Really awful.

The UPS website claims they will send a package from the UK to USA in 4 days. Awesome, right? (Spoiler alert, we've passed 40 days and still no delivery).

I sent my work computer from London to California with UPS, and went on a month long dream trip to Machu Pichu and then onwards to the Galapagos Islands.

Following that I started my new job, working remotely in California. But I had to borrow a laptop to work, as UPS didn't deliver mine.

I planned in a month for UPS to deliver something they said would take 4 days. And it still hasn't arrived. It's over 40 days now. I return to London on Saturday, but the UPS app says the package is in Louisville, Kentucky. It's been saying that since 5 Nov (over a month and counting).

Jeez, it took them 2 weeks to ship it out of the UK! Even then it was obvious the 4 day delivery claim was ridiculous!

Can their 'high level of support' send it back to the UK? No. They want to charge me for sending back to the UK a package they can't even send to the destination address! Talk about good money chasing bad.

I twice asked them to step in and re-route it back to London at no additional cost. You know, do the right thing? No dice, they say. Terrible customer service, even if the customer service agent (Dennise B.) seems like a nice person.

Avoid. Just avoid UPS.

If it ever makes it to California, my lovely family will use DHL, FedEx or the postal services to send it back to my home in London. But never UPS. Never again.

I suggest you never use UPS either, my friend. And enjoy a happier life."
"Quite simply the worst courier company in existence. Their website provides zero updates or useful information. My wife waited in all day for a delivery and it was a no show. The following day, we weren't given an update. Had to phone the customer helpline yet again to be told it would be delivered between 11:30 and 15:45. Here I am sat writing this at 16:15 with zero sign of my wifes birthday present. Zero update either. When will my package arrive, any ones guess. Shambles."
"I'd give 0 stars, but 1 star is for the Customer Support through Twitter which seems responsive and friendly.

I ordered something and UPS was supposed to deliver it. Funny enough, they never showed up at my doorstep and gave it to a pick-up point. I was home all the time and I need it at home, not in another pick-up point.

Through the service on Twitter, they rearranged another delivery - great!

Unfortunately for the redelivery, again no one bothered to show up at my door and they just moved it to a different pick-up point.

I really think I am part of a joke, because this can not be real. UPS has one job: deliver packages to the recipients. Apparently that is impossible."
"Their tracking is a mess, their reprogramming does not work, they delay packages for a week even though they already arrived in the destination country. You can't file a complaint with their dumb online system and if you call the bloody helpline you end up somewhere in South America where they know their arses from their elbows.
Horrible service."
Do not use ups courier services they have lost my laptop can not account for whereabout of package do not use this courier service should not be allowed to trade
I don't usually write reviews but came home and found my £200 pound trainers which I bought through ebay authenticy program sitting in front of my door in the pouring rain. Luckily the trainers where dry and very surprised they weren't stolen. No attempt to leave in a safe place and there should be a option on the app to have them left in a designating safe place. Ups you need to sort yourselfs out!!!!!
I have received a few deliveries the past few weeks via UPS. I have no complaints at all. The lad who delivered them was lovely & friendly. Always kept up to date on deliveries by email. Arrived when the email said it would. Great service.
"Absolute shambles of a company, they don’t deliver when they say, their customer service is non existent they are not interested or capable of doing their job, emails not answered….this is one delivery company to avoid, unfortunately if you buy from sunglass hut they use UPS, might be best to avoid them as well, as they’re not much better."
"I will never use UPS again. Paid for next day delivery and we are on day
3. Have no idea where my package is and the contest are so that it will take a lot of money to replace it. This is just sad."
"Honestly, I would give this company a minus star if it was an option. They lied about the 3 attempted deliveries as the recipient was home waiting for the parcel. Then they sent my 'time sensitive' package to a 'pick up' location. The website says the pick up location should have retained it for 7 days, but they only held it for 3 hours, and then it was determined to return to sender. It has never turned up back at our address. Tracking it has been a nightmare, no information anywhere, the local store, franchise owned, has basically said they don't care what has happened to our package, and the corporate customer service just appeases us with nonsense answers. All in all, very disappointing service and I will never use UPS again."
The package was post to be received at one of their outlets The outlet didn’t take the package and now I’m waiting even more time
This is the third time that driver's delivered to wrong building in my apt complex...they are hiring drivers who do not have pride or knowledge
"The worst company. I don't trust this company for nothing. Especially, when it come to live animals. It is officially 2 days, I still haven't received my animal. I am still awaiting. I already got a lawsuit prepared if anything happened. I am praying, they are safe and I can put this behind me. But, right now, I am so angry. Plus, don't use this company to ship alive animals. Protect your animal. Use FedEx."
"Ups suddenly refusing to leave packages At my residence- saying, This business is closed. ‘ this is a mixed use building and packages are not addressed to the business but to the residence.
Several attempts at calling, chatting, left note on the door which they sticker with their notes saying ‘attempted delivery’ very aggrivating at christmas time."
"never attempted to deliver at my house. Simply got a message that i was not at home and asked me to collect from pick up point. Very bad service, atleast say the truth when u cannot deliver, Morons"
"My package was showing as delivered yesterday at 2:15 PM by UPS. But it was NEVER delivered. As luck would have it, I was sitting by my front window between 2-3 PM, where I could see anyone who walked up to my door. They are lying. Awful service & terrible customer service. Later, at around 5 PM, they showed delivered at 7:15 PM. DELIVERED at 7:15 PM when its only 5:00 PM. Very strange.
I have saved screenshots ..... wish I could upload those.
Choose another shipper. UPS is very unreliable & not to be trusted."
"I sent a parcel via Canada Post (speaker cables) from Nova Scotia to Florida. No customs fee was added on. When my wires had been fixed and returned by UPS, a $106 fee was charged upon delivery ($30 tax...no problem), and a $66 customs clearance fee (on the value of $201). I spoke with a lady at UPS pointing out that surely, the customs fee could not be correct...being almost a third of the value of what was being shipped. She said that it was correct. Five days after the date tracking indicated that it would arrive, it arrived. Canada Post (regular parcel post) was less expensive for shipping, faster for delivery time, and no customs fee was added on."
"Another delivery, another terrible experience. (shouldnt even call it a delivery)

(no one wants to read these, sop keeping it short)
Step 1 .""Recipient was not at home""
Step2 . Call to customer sevice, and to my amazement, some honesty on the phone: "" well if its a busy day the driver might not have even been there"" Points to the customer service agent for that. As of course we were home , waiting..
Step3: Still on the call: ""Should be delivered to a pick up point, there in 2 hours"" - semi promising
Step4: couldnt not be delivered to the pick up point (a store thats open all the time..)

End result -> never attempted to deliver to my house, never even attempted to deliver to the pick up store near by. A new low for even UPS. (propably just busines as usual) Just a sad sad way of doing things)"
"Let's start from organising the collection.
After having setup the order online, organising the collection on the telephone was a nightmare, first because the person on the other side did not have a clear idea on how it works, they told me I had to pay the collector coming into my house but only after I mentioned to her that the paid had already been taken from the site they finally realised that I did not have to pay (Ins't this displayed in the system).
Understanding when the driver was going to be in my house for collection was another nightmare, because the site was reporting my package being already on its way to the destination within few hours (which is quite incredible considering that the package was still located in my house).
Obviously the packages (were two separated shipments to the same destination) arrived on time but, for my surprise both packages were broken! Please note that one of the packages was a shower tray, which, honestly, is quite difficult to break.
But let's move to get the money back (because the packages were insured, obviously), that's where the real nightmare starts. Considering that the shipment arrived around the end of September I'm still waiting for the money of one ""automatically"" approved. The other one, the shower tray, has been rejected, because despite sending the shower tray back in the same identical packaging it was sent!
Anyway to get my money back (which I did not received yet) I think I did something like 50 calls and sent several e-mails to probably all the departments the company have (inclusive offshore).
Anyway, this is just a summary of what happened, if I had to write everything it will take too long for me and I honestly already wasted too much of my time.
So please, do yourself a favour, choose another company."
"Received an email stating my package was out for delivery shortly followed by a confirmation that it was ready for pickup. I have all of my packages automatically delivered to a UPS Access Point, yet I ALWAYS have issues receiving them. The staff ALWAYS argues with me that my packages are not available when proof of delivery says that the store is the one that received and signed the package. I have had so many issues ranging to packages being scanned as delivered but left on the truck, items being delivered to the wrong UPS Access Point, or staff claiming that my package is not available even though I’ll see it sitting on the counter."
I regret that I can’t have less than 1 star as they won’t deserve even for 1 star! They keeping my parcel over a month and they just changing daily updates (warehouse scan). AVOID THIS COMPANY IF YOU DONT WANT TO LOOSE YOUR ITEMS OR WAIST YOUR TIME.
Kept informed on delivery all the way and delivered within the time scale
"I would give zero stars if I could... The worst service I have ever experienced. I sent two shipments, the first arrived in the distination and then UPS screwed it up and returned it by mistake, when the boxes arrived at the return address they were very badly beaten up, soaking wet, and half the contents were destroyed. The second order has been sitting in there warehouse for 2 months and every time I call I speak to a different customer service adivsor and they tell me a different story, usually saying they will look into it and contact me within 24 hours, but they never call or email back... Whoever owns UPS should be ashamed of their company. I would advise avoiding using UPS at all cost."
"Terrible customer service via telephone. After 49 minutes wait, I eventually managed to speak to someone who then provided inaccurate information before going on mute and hanging up a few minutes later.
It's impossible to email UPS without a functioning user ID."
"Expecting a package yesterday, which never arrived. When I tracked the order it stated that ""the receiver was not available for delivery"". However that is not true, and I have doorcam evidence to show that nobody came to the door to deliver the package. Either went to the wrong house (although neighbours were in) or it was a pack of lies."
"Awful experience. Package currently missing. Customer service keep passing around without notice and have to begin explaining again. Honestly, avoid at all costs."
First off UPS don't tell me to not use offensive words paid $35 for overnight and of course it didn't show up so don't tell me anything
"I have never been this angry with a company before! I have a package that was supposed to be delivered today that I needed to sign for, but they never came. They gave me a time frame of 9am-9pm and I had plans today, but had to cancel to make sure I was home to sign for it. Cancelled my plans and still no package. Also, this was one of the few days off I had from work. I called customer service to see what the hell happened, but all I got is an automated response that will not connect me to an agent and hangs up on me. Tried filing a claim online like it said to and every time I try to create an account it says it cannot fulfill my request. Garbage company!"
"I have had such bad experiences with UPS. The drivers lie to say something has been delivered and hasn't. You make enough money to not steal customers' orders if that is the case. Get your lazy asses out of your trucks and deliver too big items to the customer's door instead of trying to shove them into a small mailbox which you almost tore up or gave access to someone walking down the street to steal because the mailbox could not close!
This is not my first rodeo with UPS, but I am sick of their drivers! Something needs to be done! Supervisors do random stops after them. And the customer service is a JOKE!! They don't care either. So from here on out, I am to put my experiences in reviews. Maybe the CEO sees this and gets to the bottom of this."
I hate that UPS stamps your package is out for Delivery and it can get there anywhere from 8am to 9pm with no real updates except out for delivery. At least the United states postal service will trace the driver to each city letting you know how near your package is. Still waiting at 7pm
Very terrible they are. They should not near any of my parcels. They steal everything. Just not responsible company.
"I have no problem with UPS services, but their tracking systems su#%@ Once again a company wants to change something that works and makes it worst instead. Who ever you hired to manage the tracking project should be FIRED!"
Very bad service delivery from overseas to USA they said take up to4days and coming within 9 days all thing in the backg mixed up and damage cost me over three handred dollars going to trash
"Return parcel that should never be at customs according to hmrc,ups UK got stuck in customs for 2 months now. Joke"
"I shop from online stores and small batch shops all the time. I ordered two handmade wooden knives and some small wooden blocks for a decoration. The value of the package was under $100. I receive a strange call from UPS with regards to ""Broker Fee"" in order to receive consent (random delivery fee) to deal with customs to deliver the package. The estimate for my $92 item was $30 JUST for the brokerage. This does not include customs which was unknown. The final fee to deliver my package was $57. There was no breakdown or rationale attached to their website, but offered me a discount to pay $51 if I don't dispute and pay online ASAP. I called UPS and was very unhappy with the customer service. I feel taken for having to pay this ransom fee I have never had to deal with before, just customs at some occasions. I am disgusted around Christmas season that they seem to be randomly selecting and gouging customers. This will be my last time with UPS. Nasty."
Courier attempted to deliver my item I saw him outside my property so ran back and to get the parcel from him was willing to show i.d or open my front door . He said to late now don’t see how as he was parked outside my house . Parcel left 3 miles from my house now at a shop and I don’t have car . Very helpful . Worse courier ever
Expensive. Rude. Will damage your packages. Won't pay any claims. Will assess late fees if you dispute erroneous charges. Not reliable. ZERO customer service. Horrible automated AI system which won't let you speak with a real live person. Run!
"Unable to even inform me the right day of delivery, let alone hour. Unable to talk to about delivery.

NEVER USE ANY MORE"
"I should choice o star
Most horrible company"
"Awful service. Package due to be delivered a week ago, tracking info just says 'delay', no information on where it is, £400 item missing, presumably gone forever, now for the joys of making a claim."
"ITEM DAMAGE DURING DELIVERY !!!
WHEN I TRY REPORT DAMAGE CLAIM I GET THIS INFO....

PLEASE PREP YOURSELF BEFORE POSTING ANYTHING WITH UPS !!!!!!

YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE THOSE EVIDENCE IF ITEM ARRIVE DAMAGE !!!

The 7 photos we need

Damaged merchandise inside the box displayed as it arrived to you.
Packaging material used (bubble wrap, styrofoam, etc.)
Damaged item outside of the box.
A close-up of the shipping label with tracking number.
If available, a close-up of the box manufacturer's certificate (BMC).
1 photo displaying the top and 2 sides.
1 photo displaying the bottom and the opposite sides."
"I have used this company a few times before, it always ended up to receive delayed of delivery during the day, I hope that the business need think no to use them !!!!"
The worst experience I have ever had even Hermes is better. First of all there has been a mistake in the customs clearance I had to pay so I did not pay as the customs bill was higher than my order which is nonesense!! I asked them to check that they said they will solve this it is now more than 2 weeks and still nothing has been done so many phone call so many hours over the phone the customer service were so rude and they cut the call !!!! horrible people and terrible experience. After n’y that I spoke to HMRC wand they asked me to pay the customs duty which are higher than my order and they will refund me the extra money I paid ! Ups driver is calling me and asking me if I want my parcel that’s a big joke ! I can not explain everything here but I am exhausted. Please don’t use this service people are so unskilled and unrespectfull !!
"How can you still be in business when everyone gives you 1 star for pathetic service?
delayed, lost, mis-tracked, over-charged. every error a parcel company can make.
Like an international Yodel."
"it would almost be funny if it wasn't such a complete waste of my time dealing with this antiquated company. Every time I get an import duty invoice from UPS my heart now sinks. I have this time been sat on the phone for about an hour, passed between call centres in some far off country, none of whom have the foggiest idea what is going on. UPS senior management seriously need firing. Every last one of them. Their company is a joke."
"they apparently attempted to delivery my package but i was not available. what a joke, did they just expect me to read their mind that they were at the door? I HAVE A DOORBELL. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE IT TO NOTIFY THAT YOU ARE AT THE DOOR. They did not even ring, and now delivered my parcel unceremoniously in a pick up location. they make you sign up to an account with them if you want to track your parcel and / or change the redelivery date. NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
"I just want to write this review, for this lovely young man called Stefr.
He brings great service and a smile on my face, he was so polite .. and after talking i figured out he was Canadian.

Then I proceed to say all Canadians always so friendly and polite!

Really made my day, give this man a raise!"
Would rate zero stars if possible. Lost two packages valued at over $1000 and refuse to open an investigation because of a contract with the shipper who says that they cannot open an investigation after a package has been scanned as delivered regardless of weather or not the package was ever anywhere near its final destination.
"Company sucks !!!!!!

UPS has to have the worst drivers and customer service. The drivers must be braindead and be deaf or something. Chasing a package for 4 days and still nothing.
I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND OR USE UPS!!!!!
Don't waste your energy leaving notes or even ask customer service to relay a message. They don't know how !

I will find a manager somewhere to inquire how many braincells it takes to work there."
"I will spend double or triple to never have to ever use UPS ever again. They are the worst of all the shippers including the USPS and that’s the government so that’s sad.

Paid for 2 day guaranteed shipping it’s been 4 days and now it says delivered tomorrow then I said I’ll just pick it up and they made me pay $8 to pick it up!!! I just paid $40 to ship it for “2 days guaranteed”"
"The worst delivery service ever! Never on time, drivers treat packages like a football, and if your package ever gets lost (which they frequently do), good luck getting hold of a customer service rep."
"I mailed a box that was about
15"" by 10"" by 5"" That weighed 2 lbs. It was being shipped within a metropolitan area but 31 miles from my home. I think the $32 charge is extremely ridiculous. It will be a long time, if ever, coming for me to ever use UPS again."
I just watched a driver truck number 196703 he walked up about 13 of 18 steps and proceeded to throw his package the rest of the way with a 4 foot landingI heard it hit hard. He also had his mask under his chin not on his face. I do have to give him good credit for a quiet wave to my comments to him about his terrible delivery. He also drove very nice through the parking lot unlike most delivery drivers. He needs to take the extra 30 seconds and set the package down as far out of site as possible without damaging his customers products.
"Quick service, however incorrect postage on package so had to pay additional fee £10.00 to Royal Mail .
Have bought several times before and not had similar issue."
"UPS is the worst delivery provider I have ever dealt with, on several occasions I have had issues with UPS, but today, I had an expensive package to be delivered - the address label appeared to be printed incorrectly (reported to my neighbour) the driver attempted delivery to my neighbour but he advised to contact the Customer. The driver returned to his van with the parcel and went elsewhere. The driver did not attempt to call my number.
I then received an email saying it had been delivered, to an incorrect location stating it was left on ‘door step’ no proof of anything or an exact address it had been left at.
Contacted UPS which was quite responsive, but advised if I didn’t receive my parcel in 48 hours to call the service and make them aware!
My parcel had been delivered to a total wrong address, and wasn’t even contacted for guidance to my address! Which he was originally on the right road !!"
U tter P athetic S ervice. Useless courier
"Just saw a news report where UPS said your package will get there when it gets there, uh no, it’ll get there when it’s scheduled to get there or you will be giving me my money back."
"Why do I have to leave at least one star? This simply increases the rating for this company. UPS are either the most incompetent delivery company in the world or, more likely, a worldwide scam.
Avoid at all costs.
If you use UPS they will almost always claim that you have not paid the correct VAT, then refuse to accept duplicate paperwork and claim that you have abandoned your parcel, so you don't even get it back!"
"I have to agree with all the negative comments about UPS. They provide almost no tracking information (no delivery hour or even 2 hour timeslots), and offer ineffective customer service. I would always opt to use other services given the choice and would avoid companies who use them to deliver their products if that information is available in advance."
"UPS happy to take my money but not actually pick up the parcel.
Yes, that's right, a courier that for days on end doesn't reply and never collects the package.
I've never had service as bad on any purchase whatsoever. They are in a class of their own.
Went for them as I assumed they are professional.

Went with Hermes to fix it and it was delivered the next working day despite quoting 3-4 days. And they are the amateurs!"
"ups along with parcelhero have taken over £80 from my bank account to deliver a uk mainland parcel of less than 10kilos less than a meter in lenght 75 cm in height 10cm in depth ie a toyota RH wing body panel, paid £19 to parcelhero ups delivered the parcel on the 9th nov 26th nov paypal emailed that parcelhero are charging £61.54 with no notice ,no explaination from ups or parcelhero appalliing customer service from both companys, advoid at all cost"
"UPS frequently lie about attempting delivery. More times than not they have made no attempt to deliver my packages and then said they did.

Nobody should ever use them."
"Absolutely soul destroying experience. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT YOUR PARCEL COLLECTED FRON YOUR HOME.
Booked a collection for Thursday because customer needed item on Friday. Paid £10.95 + £2.40 for home collection.
They never turned up, despite giving a 5 hour window. I telephoned and complained and was assured that parcel would definitely be collected on Friday.
Again, they didn't turn up. Rearranged for Monday 9am-3pm. Finally arrived at 2.55pm and claimed that I needed to pay another £4. I refused to pay and they took the parcel anyway. I will NEVER use UPS again. A hugely stressful experience all round. I strongly suggest using a competitor service. Anything is better than this. 1 star is 1 star more than they deserve."
"Absolutely the ones to avoid and no wonder why 92 % of people give this company a one star because there’s nothing lower that can be given. These time wasters wasted my whole day expecting for a parcel to be collected, when I contact customer services, they advising me to wait for another 10 minutes without any communication with the driver. Unfortunately it was Apple’s choice to use you guys , if it was mine , I wouldn’t have bothered. So disgusting.. you guys should be ashamed for wasting other peoples time."
Worst company ever! Avoid at all cost! Don't even deserve 1 star. Sending false delivery updates. Lying about unsuccessful delivery attempts! Should be closed down.
"Worse than poor service, underhand charges / attempt to extort money... BEWARE!

Did not choose this service, but they delivered an item that I ordered online, from Sweden.... I expected an additional charge for customs, and this was paid on demand.

Approximately one week later I received an innocuous-looking letter through the post - no indication it was from UPS... received at the same time as some junk mail in a similar unmarked white envelope... so, I could easily just have binned it as junk.... turns out it was a demand for 0.45 pence, AFTER the parcel had been delivered?!? ... Looking at the small print it said that if this amount remained unpaid, then they would charge me an addtional 8% per day, AND an 'administration' charge of £40 !!!

I tried to clarify on the UPS 'helpline', why I had received this extra charge, and got through to an extremely rude woman, who clearly had a restricted command of the English language, ... she interrupted me several times, ignored my questions, told me to pay on 'line 1' and then cut me off.

Determined to get to the bottom of what seems like a blatent attempt to extort money from customers I sent a complaint to their Customer Services, ... I was given a complete runaround, as they repeatedly asked me to provide them tracking numbers / then copies of the letter, proof of postage etc etc.... this from a company that had sent me the reference number! (and are supposedly the experts at tracking🤣😂🤣)

After a completely futile exchange of emails with a Cynthia C. ??? I was told to expect a phone call in response to my concerns, needless to say no call was received.

Useless Parcel Service seems to live up to it's name 😂"
"Not only did my customer not get his goods for 4 days instead of next day, quoted by UPS, (they said it was misdirected !) Tracking was hopeless, & now UPS Customer Services are giving me the run around for the £20.09 Unauthorised ( stolen ? ) amount they have taken from my account even with me replying to several emails with details. Now more of my time wasted for me to contact again."
"I just want to share my horrible experience with UPS.

I had a package scheduled to be delivered. On that day, I was working from home and I received a notification on my phone stating that my package was in front of my front door. I opened the door and I was surprised to find out that there was nothing in front of the door. I searched all the possible areas in the building and I spoke to management and security and could not locate the package.

I then decided to contact UPS customer service and it took a few phone calls to get some help to open a claim for an investigation. I explained that my package contained very important documents and I needed the investigation to move fast but I was one more time surprise to find out that they could not help.

A friend of mine recommended that I contact them on social media and I did thinking that I may find someone a bit more competent to help me but I was told that I had to wait for 8 days for the investigation to be completed and they could not do anything for me. I explained one more time the situation and I disclosed the nature of the documents in the package but they could not help. This time, I was not surprised at all taking in consideration the poor service I was provided from the beginning. It took me a second to complete the equation even if I am not that good in maths - you pay big money for horrible service!"
"Was notified my package was delivered to my back door. I have no back door. I filed a claim and they sent me paperwork to a delivered item 10 miles away to a person I do not even know at an address nothing like my address. Names are not even similar and they give these tracking numbers to merchandisers, walmart or amazon sellers and it is fraud. Pure fraud."
"Appallingly bad, trying to set up MyChoice, impossible service to set up, customer support equally appalling and simply just too hard to use, going forward will use anyone I can before them - even a carrier pigeon will be better"
Bad and slow don’t like the service provider very inefficient customer service
"Packages are being stolen in our neighborhood. The thieves are following the driver and picking up the packages he leaves. A neighbor saw the car full of packages and took fown the license plate. When the driver was told , he shrugged his shoulders and said do you know how busy he is. We believe he was in on it, ups needs to do better. People get insurance on your packages"
"UPS Shipping users (sellers & buyers) BEWARE of extra un-authorised UPS Brokerage fees they charge to Canadians & Cross Border Shoppers. UPS will use EXTORTION by refusing to deliver your order unless you pay C.O.D. (approx.. $35.)
Extortion meaning: the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats like UPS is doing with it’s extra UPS Brokerage Cie. fees."
"Packages sitting in Lautzenhausen, Germany for almost a week with the foolish excuse of delay, was supposed to be delivered Nov 22nd.
Are we paying express shipping just for F sake??

This company never fails to disappoint.
If only there’s a way to have them shut down."
"I ordered a package from Amazon, they shipped it by UPS. UPS sent it to the wrong city and tried to deliver it in the wrong city. When I tried to call customer service, I got automated phone and was never allowed to talk to a real live person. I then called the UPS store and tried to talk to them, again automated phone system then it hung up. Worst service I’ve ever had, to hell with these people. If I can I’ll never use them again."
"Waited at my house more than 7 hours for the driver to show up, not showering, constantly looking out the window and the front door to see if he's there. And then I get a notification that I missed him... It was a signature-required delivery and the driver didn't even ring the doorbell and then left with the package... It's Saturday and now I have to wait until Monday to get a package that I needed a couple of days ago. Just because the driver couldn't knock hard enough to alert someone who was waiting all morning and constantly checking for them. Maybe next time try to ring the doorbell."
"They didn’t deliver my package due to not signing for the package. I work so how am I supposed to leave a signature. They leave a paper to sign so I can receive my the next day without me being there but they instead leave another paper to sign. UPS has some of the most brain dead deliver drivers out there. Why sign for my package when I live in a rural area, who’s going to steal my package???a coyote???morons"
"UPS is the worst delivery service to you could possibly use. If you choose to have anything delivered, choose FedEx because they were get it there when they say they will have to your door. If you choose UPS they will take advantage of the delays, and make it there like four months after they say it's supposed to be at your door. I will no longer order from anywhere that uses UPS. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. Even to United States Post Offices does a better job than UPS."
"UPS delivered my package to the wrong address. In a completely different City. Since the merchant has insured the package. I'll get my money back. But because it was a one of a kind. Custom made purchase. It can never be replaced. UPS themselves don't even care. They have hit the apex of incompetence, with a side of indifference. Don't send anything through them. That isn't easily replaceable."
"UPS is absolutely the WORST package delivery service you can choose from. Its bad enough that almost all boxes arrive open or damaged and that the messaging is completely inconsistent and that you cannot reach an actual live person.

Note for others: I finally did reach a live person by speaking jibberish for 10 minutes through the prompts but they were JUST as useless as the AI attendant.

On top of everything, THEY LIE!! For two days, I've gotten emails saying ""your package is coming early"" which was a shock. Since, every day I get messages saying ""A delivery attempt was made but signature required and no one home"" which is total BS!! I'm sitting here in my home typing this on my laptop by the front door. I've been here the entire past 4 days. I mean I understand its the holidays and I'm fine with ""We are running behind and your package had to be rescheduled"" but DO NOT say an attempt was made to deliver when I've been here the entire time.

If given a choice, I NEVER Use them. They have the WORST reputation. I prefer writing good reviews. Most of the time, I write good reviews because I believe most people just complain online but UPS is terrible and I'm done being lied to."
"Aleisha works at store # 2971 (Daphne, Alabama) yesterday she helped me and guided me to solve a problem.
Aleisha was very patient and kind.
Thanks Aleisha!"
"shame, UPS is the worst company in the US! I was supposed to get the package in three days, and not even in six! The tracking system sucks. No package tracking in real time! The help desk is terrible, the wait is too long and the staff is not professional or friendly. I will never ship with UPS again! Worse than some banana state!"
I order a package and it got lost for 2 months! I sat on my porch every day waiting and looked at the thing and it said it was delivered ABSOLUTELY NOT I'm so ashamed of this company and I never got my items.
"I ordered a turkey roulades from a company in the New Jersey area for Thanksgiving on Nov 17th, they gave it to UPS with 2nd Day Air shipping on Nov 22nd with a Frozen Foods sticker on it, and UPS delivers it to me the day after Thanksgiving, Nov 26th, 4 days after accepting it for 2nd Day Air delivery. All the dry ice had evaporated, and the turkey roulades was thawed and spoiled. The shop I ordered from refunded me totally, but UPS ruined my Thanksgiving."
"I was waiting for a delivery and found that delivery was 'attempted' while I was home. I did not receive a knock on the door or a phone call, but instead got an 'info notice' indicating ""Sorry we missed you"". The next day delivery failed because they could not find my address (despite having affixed the 'info notice' directly on my mailbox the previous day). Today I phoned and the automated system informed me that the package couldn't be delivered because the address was incomplete. The address associated with the shipment comes up without a problem if cut and pasted into google maps so I am at a loss as to how they continue to fail to deliver this package. While their customer support is very polite, they have been unable to provide any useful information, and cannot even confirm at which depot the package is being held.

It was still morning, and when it was clear that there was no problem with the address (and never had been) they said that they would attempt again on the next business day. I noted that this was unacceptable, and it was there responsibility to fulfill their service despite the inconvenience, since all delays and inconveniences thus far had due to the fault of their employees. Surprisingly, I received the package later in the afternoon (but I don't believe it should have required so many phone calls to simply delivery a package).

I will avoid this company in future whenever possible."
"I don't understand how this company is so popular with how terrible it is at it's ONE AND ONLY job.

I used them (not by choice) around 5/6 times this year.

Not once, NOT A SINGLE TIME. Did they deliver my stuff on time.

Not just by a day or 2, every single time my item took over 2 weeks past the delivery date to arrive.

I will be going out of my way to avoid this scam of a company on all future purchases, and I recommend everybody else do the same.

To any business owners reading this: do not engage with UPS, use another delivery service (Not Yodel either though).

Pathetic. You literally can't do the single job you're supposed to do."
Very fast delivery and very easy and convenient returns. Courier appeared next day morning as promised to collect items. Great service.
"I orderd a table from Amazon. Needed it for extra room for family for Thanksgiving. It was so beat up and damaged, broken. I would think the carrier would be ashamed to leave it. The box was falling to pieces."
"Pre-Brexit used UPS to ship from UK to Germany and it went so smoothly. Packages arrive in 3 or 4 days.

Post-Brexit thought I'd pay a bit more for speed of service. My package is still sitting at 'Herne-Boernig' with no movement for over 6 days. Current status reads 'Check back tomorrow for an updated delivery date.'

Will never use UPS again. It's quicker and cheaper by Royal mail."
"This company is a giant mechanism to steal money from ppl, the delivery time is NEVER correct, even if guaranteed. They copy and paste some excuse on tracking like ""mechanical delay"" or ""plane delay"" even 10 times in 2 weeks so you WON'T BE ABLE TO ASK FOR REFOUND. trust me and never buy here"
"Overpriced, email spammer, constantly changing the selected drop-off option. I only pick UPS when there's no other delivery option available."
"As an American, I'm embarrassed at this company.

Called a day before expected delivery, no notification by text or email, asked for import charges at the door when I wasn't home without prior notification.

Website is terrible, with broken links and redirects, payment system a nightmare. Tried to log in and arrange delivery; I'm required to fill in forms to join 'MyChoices' or something, and at the end I'm told there was an error.

Avoid this company at all costs."
"Use any other delivery service than UPS Sweden, every other option is better. Every second time the packages will be re-routed to a service point and you get the message that you where not at home, even IF you've been home all day and have used their MyChoice to opt for delivery if you're not home. No one try to reach you, just re-routing."
It's been more than a month since the company returned my box due to lack of documentation but so far it hasn't returned the money and hasn't been able to create a new shipping label. The worst service. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
"Received email saying my item would be delivered today at 12, still waiting……… Rang up, was told there are two sides to every story……It’s not UPS fault……Yes tracking is not correct…..Try again in the morning…..

So tired of this UPS, paid for express delivery."
"I have a bad experience everytime I have package to pick up at UPS. The first time was when I had the package from my home country to where I live - Sweden. They said they attempted to deliver my package but they couldn’t. In fact, I have never seen them to try to send it to me. The second time was the same experience. Always said could not find and I always have to go to the access point to pick up. The last time is today. Such a BAD service. I received the notification about my package and I chose to send it to the nearest access point. However, they delivered my package to the place where is an hour away from where I live. Do I have to drive one hour or pay the train ticket to pick it up???? I called the customer service. The first call he told me just go there to pick it up. No better solution. I called again and this time I had to meet totally 4 agents since they just kept saying ”I’ll transfer you to another department”. Then each time I met new person I have to say such a longggggg tracking number all over again. I met the last one. The only thing she could do was asking me and REPEATING what I answered :). The no solution for my case. She asked my email and promised me that I would received an email from them within 15 minutes and they would investigate in the case. 3 hours passed. No email from UPS. Such a irresponsible company!!!!!!"
"My package was returned to sender due to “customer refusal”. That did not happen or at least the delivery was not attempted at our house. In fact, we had another package delivered by UPS the same day in the same time period successfully. Prior to the delivery attempt I paid $10 (for each package) to have the delivery postponed for one day to ensure that I would be home to receive them. I was not offered a refund for that $10. Both packages were marked as signature required - the one was left on my doorstep and the other, as I said, was not delivered at all. I tried the worthless customer service number which is a misnomer. It cannot connect you to a real person or provide any avenue to do so. I eventually tried technical support and spoke to three different customer service representatives - none of them were helpful. The first of them, Ivan at technical support on 11/17 around 4pm, told me that I would be able to pick it up from dispatch before it went all the way back to sender and apparently that was a lie. I waited all evening, prepared to go pick it up, for a call from dispatch just as Ivan promised. There was no follow-up to inform me he was mistaken. I also spoke to Marion at technical support 11/18 around 800 am, she informed me that Ivan lied then immediately transferred me so she wouldn’t have to hear my reaction, brusque and uninterested. I was transferred to Kevin in international shipping. Kevin was patient and thorough but not able to help me in any way at all. In the end, I had to personally manage the logistics of my shipment outside of UPS. A shipment which was entrusted to these logistics experts, and to top it off I paid extra to ensure it would arrive on a day that I was home. All in all it was the most frustrating shipping experience I have ever had hands-down."
UPS sucks on every level. The can never deliver on time and customer service is terrible. I wish I could always choose FedEx
"I have never dealt with a worse company, the over charged me of shipping and customs (£5000 for a £50 product) and then were so unhelpful in telling me why it even cost that much..... I hope I never have to deal with them again ever. They were ever worse then hermes"
"Really prompt delivery, only 2 days from ordering to receiving item.

Easy to track, was meant to come on Friday, came on Thursday!

Friendly driver, would recommend!"
"Awful. They lost my parcel, admitted it was lost within 24hrs of me telling them it was, approved the claim etc. This was over a month ago and I nor the shipper have heard or received anything from them. They said it'd take MAX 8 working days...also lazy and useless responses."
"Every company has 1 or 2 lazy people but I have never ever seen a FULL COMPANY OF LAZY PEOPLE.

I always chase my parcels, whoever answers the phone seems constantly disturbed, angry and unwilling to move from the coffee cup.

There are so many people who really need jobs and the money in the world. Here is the actual example of wasted salary…I assume they hire based on laziness and incapacity of relating to people skills…"
If only i could rate 0/5. They dont deliver my parcel. I always collect my parcel in their access point. Lousy courier! Not even an update that my parcel was out for delivery nor it was sent back to their access point. Very bad service.
"Two seperate orders from Amazon, UPS shows both delivered, neither order here! I can't help but think they say stuff is delivered just to shorten the route so they can get off early. To top it off, to make a claim is excruciating....In this day and age I should be able to push one button on the tracking page, it shouldn't matter what's in the box!"
Last time I have UPS do any deliveries I'll use fedex from now on delivered a part from Carolina to massachusetts in one day but couldnt be delivered to my house in the same state in under a day now I've gotta wait two days for a part I should've had today and they wouldnt let me pick up my package that's in my name I would have to contact seller
"Appalling service. For a 70 eur delivery fee they have provided misinformation, failed to communicate between two business units of the same organisation & handed over delivery of the consignment to another courier who for over 2.5 weeks has stalled delivery with no-contact to me. By comparison DHL delivered from the same region door to door in 8 days for 20 eur... I honestly can not understand why anyone would elect to use UPS."
"Last time I will be using UPS for any type of services. They attempt delivery today and I called back to retrieve the the ups location. Customer service informed me that it will be a $7.95 charge to pick up from the location effective since Oct. They will redeliver 2 more times before I can retrieve from the station for free. So why can’t I just get it today for free and not waste your resources? Why are they asking receivers to pay additional money to pick up at their local location? Double dipping on both ends? Well, effective now UPS lost my business forever."
Crap absolute crap. They didn’t even ring the doorbell to deliver the package. They are trash and customer service sucks even more.
"Never even think of using UPS even in your dreams.. this is the height of carelessness and don’t bother about customers. In the first attempt they tried to deliver the parcel to some random business address instead of residential address. Called up customer service and confirmed the address to be delivered and promised that items will be delivered first thing next day morning but it never came. There is no way of tracking the item or the driver never call if any confusion instead delivered my parcel with my personal items to some random address . Had to call customer service team for an update as to where it was delivered and I have been sent the proof of delivery which shows a complete random address to what it was supposed to be delivered to. There is not even single call or emails from them even after chasing and calling them for 4 times within a span of 4 hours. Stay away from them or you will end in wasting time, effort and money."
the worst f-in service ever. automated phones keep hanging up on people.
"Very very bad service!!!!, they never notify you where is your package or whatever!!! And the delivery driver just always left a print label that they attempt to deliver it, the thing is they supposed to be calling you or message you but then again they never care!!! They just want you to pick up and extra $8.00 fee for pick up!!!! Imagine that! Ups just ruin my week!!! I need that package for a living and then they just say i need to pay $8.00 to pick up!!! So upset!!!! Inconvinience and disturbance you made UPS!!!!"
"No updates on tracking the parcel for 8 days in a row, missed estimated delivery date, not clear where the parcel is and no information on a new delivery date. Customer response from UPS it to wait couple of days to see whether the parcel ""shows-up""."
"Terrible service, waited all day for UPS to collect a parcel but they never arrived. Customer service line barely understands English and generally doesn’t have a clue. Never use again."
"AWFUL.
Paid for next day express delivery, it arrived 4 days late.
The coustmer service is terrible they couldnt tell where the package was at any point or just did not want to tell me.
Told me it would be delivered by end of day when it was still in depot in different country. Then tried to say address was incorrect when it was fully correct, no one even called phone number supplied to check.
TERRIBLE DO NOT USE!!"
"I order alot of stuff online, and I never have any issue except with UPS. UPS drivers apparently can't operate a buzzer code to enter an apartment building. Anyone who lives in an apartment building or condo, be aware, your residence is an impenetrable mystery to UPS. As a result, you will be subject to an endless maze of the customer service phone system, and eventually required instead to pick up your package in a completely different town. I've been through this exact same circus with UPS over and over again."
"Wish there was a way to write a review with less than zero stars. Been mailing and shipping packages for years and never had a package go missing. I was hesitant to ship a ring valued at $8500 but had no choice….. yes I was stupid. Of course within 24 hours it went missing. No customer service, cannot talk to anyone that can actually do anything. Get the run-around and multiple stories. Investigation filed and just have to wait the number of days (which also differs depending on who you talk to) …. No updates and no one to talk to that’s actually “investigating”. Then, if package is not found, UPS will determine if they will pay the amount the package was insured for….even though there is a certified appraisal. What on earth did I pay $175 for? They’re in the jewelry appraisal business now? Never again will I use UPS…and I suggest no one ship anything with them that you value….. they do not care it’s just another package to them. Now I know why they used FedEx in the movie “Cast Away”."
very worst...they are charging for the deliveries they missed to deliver
UPS delivery experience is very bad! Hope there is an option when ordering online on who is the courier. What’s the pint of letting sender write additional delivery instructions such as shipping to a business address and specifically indicating deliver Mon-Fri plus clinic hours? Then they are delivering it at night. Sender just getting remarks this is second or last attempt. THEY DO NOT READ INSTRUCTIONS! Upon first attempt- it does not take a genius person to deliver it again during office/clinic hours. They should already noticed that the recipient’s address is a business location! What a shame! NO COMMON SENSE AT ALL!
This place sucks to work at. Treat you like animals and don’t give a damn about safety or none of that. Supervisors will lie to you. HR is unfair and never answers the phone. Paychecks get screwed up constantly . Terrible place
"I live in SF in the outer Richmond District. On 11/22/21 about 11:30 am I went to wait for my wife who was coming back with groceries. I found a vehicle completely blocking my driveway. I saw it there was a orange cone inside, it was a gray Toyota Camry. A minute later a UPS worker comes from across the street. I ask him not to block my driveway. He yells ‘f__k that s__t’ I thought he was ‘high’ My wife arrives as this guys is acting nuts. She then attempts to pull into the driveway and he purposely continues to block. Yelling, ‘what?’ Call the police. I finally went up to him and told him to ‘move’. He pulled up enough so she could barely get in from piled up traffic. He then comes out as I document him on video and tries to video us and our home. We both tell him to leave repeatedly. The neighbors came out and told him (UPS driver) to leave and vid him as well. He finally leaves. A few minutes later, I call UPS and speak to a supervisor ‘Martin’ . He was professional, and told me UPS will follow up. As of yet, I haven’t heard anything. Amazing there is a an angry, probably violent individual working ‘with’ the public. What does he do with the names on the packages and locations he come across?"
"I'm so done with UPS and seller utilizing them for deliveries, my address is perfectly fine on the purchase moment and on my account with UPS and the f driver just dropped my package at the store because apparently address was missing the apt #, when's a lie. They just need to do their damn job right."
"I have called about 6 times to try to get my UPS account aet up on the UPS website so I can submit a claim and each time I get this message: ""Unfortunately, your account number is not associated with your UPS.com profile.
To fix this, please select ‘Payment Options’ in the upper right corner. Next select ‘Existing Account’ from the Add Payment Method drop-down option.
Finally, select ‘Add’ and then follow the prompts to add an account number or click here.""
However, these are not even remotely accurate instructions. Those options aren't even on the website.
I have tired calling and calling and I keep gettinG put in AN endless loop of getting transferred from person to person who says they can't help me but will transfer me to a dept that will, but I keep getting routed back to the original number I called... UPS CUST service is NON-EXSISTANT so I will not be using UPS and instead will use FedEx!!!!!
ups you need to do much, much, much, much better than you are doing!!! Maybe bring jobs back to the United States instead of people in the Philippines who can't understand what you are saying and keep routing customers back to the original number they calle dthat can't help the,. HORRIBLE!!! AND INEXCUSIBLE!!!"
"They have made two ""attempts"" to deliver a package that requires a signature. Both attempts so far have been during a window where people including myself are obviously still at work. Made a UPS account and put in my contact information to receive updates. Have not received any updates. Tracking page says ""will be delivered today by 9:00 PM"" but when I call customer service they say it will be delivered between 2:30 - 4:30 PM. That would have been nice to know from the Tracking page but it does not say that at all. I shouldn't have to take a day off work just to be able to receive a package."
"My £1,800 parcel is now lost, I was told it was in the van for delivery, but the poor driver had to many drops and could not deliver it, that was 3 days ago, I’ve now spent £81:30 in calls trying to locate it, but managers never call back , crap service , no they tell me they have lost it at there Tamworth warehouse, all those tracking scanners inside any parcel building and they can’t find it.

UPS

Undelivered
Parcel
Specialist

Shocking rubbish service , DPD from now on"
Paid for over night but was delivered 3 days later than expected. When I asked for a refund they blamed it on the weather which makes them not have to do their job.
UPS is broken and circling the drain. Web site wont accept brokers payments and they do not know why. Call center in the Philippines staff are nice but very hard to understand. No supervisors are available. This company makes the government look smart.
"They lost 2 of my packages that was said to have been delivered on the exact same day sent by two different people and they did nothing at all to rectify the situation other than avoid responsibility for their driver losing two of my packages, and they gave me the run-around for two whole days. This is definitely poor service. If your company loses the package you should definitely have a way of recovering the package and it should be what you do not you making the receiver work to recover their own package that your company loss. This was completely ludicrous and so was your customer service. Long story short they made me contact the sender said they had to file a claim, I had to re-order the boots and one pair was out of stock smdh! Definitely worst shipping experience I’ve ever had!"
"I tried UPS for the first time and guess what , it is going to be my last time now . Very very disapointed ."
"I have been trying to contact customer support and technical support as I wasn't able to download the documents needed for the package because of a bug in their website. I called since yesterday afternoon but nobody answered and I get directed to voicemail. Customer support chat in facebook was no help too and just gave me the same number that I have been trying to reach since yesterday. CUSTOMER SERVICE QUALITY IS VERY POOR! NO INTITIATIVE FROM CHOUMOUS AND GHAYA. They didn't help at all and replied me things unrelated to my concern. I had to repeat my concern and the documents I needed several times for them to understand, but still NO HELP! VERY FRUSTRATING"
Driver lie about attempt to deliver and no one at home. I'm 24/7 at home a disabled person. Waiting for delivery from this company. Drivers don't bother just drop the parcel at pick up point. Far away from home. Expecting a disabled ♿ person to go and pick up his parcel it's disgusting behaviour of this company.
I sent some very important documents with UPS on 11th August 21 to Jamaica and to date it hasn’t arrived. When I checked with them they said I had abandoned the package then they said the receiver had. They also said it wasn’t addressed properly for the US. It’s going to Jamaica and clearly addressed. I wanted to initiate a claim but they said the package isn’t lost but abandoned. Who abandoned it? Not me. They have been searching for this package for 3 months. I’ve written to just about anyone I could get hold of in the company and have not had a single reply. I have been waiting 3 months. Customer services said they have called me but I have never received such call or even a miss call. I have had to pay out to get new documents. UPS just do not care.
"A delivery company that does not attempt to deliver, what a genius concept for 2021. Instead of driving to your house and delivering the parcel to your door they have come up with a brand new concept within the space. That is to deliver your packages to a place that is convenient for them.
In my experience this is invariably one of those shops that are clearly a front for money laundering you know the kind they do 2nd hand phones/repairs and usually luggage, why luggage boys and have absolutely 0 foot traffic.
The wider problem is as this place does not make its money the usual way it holds absolutely no regular business hours, you have to steak out the place for days asking friends and family who happen to pass ""is it open today""?

Seriously what are you guys playing at? Look at your reviews on this site alone, you really think your going to magically turn this around? Just give up and fold the uk branch of this company and stop being a perennial thorn in the side of the public."
"This delivery service is so, so incompetent. Avoid if you can. I've spent hours on calls with them, having waited 2 weeks for the delivery - they'll tell you they've resolved it but haven't. Terrible communication and 3 weeks later, my parcel is back at the place I ordered it from. Definitely won't be using this company again!"
"I was in the Griffin, GA store #2982 yesterday, 11/22/2021, first thing with 16 Christmas packages to ship. I was met by a lady who was so kind, helpful and courteous. What a great way to start my day. I don't remember her name but she did tell me that she opens up every day. She sets the bar high for great customer service! Thank you."
The delivery was prompt and fast. The very heavy rug was delivered in to my apartment in a multi store building. I am so pleased!
"I don't even know where to start... Their level of incompetence is unreal. Zero customer service. They charge your card without invoicing or explanation. When you contact customer service, no one can help and they give you a different (wrong) answer every time. I don't understand who is training these people or how they have jobs, I've never seen anything like it. They're the cheapest option to ship abroad and I've used them many times but this will now stop. I'd rather pay more and not have such a bad experience. The fact that they have such bad reviews and don't even care about it... Mind-blowing!!! Things will slip through the net but that's where customer service are supposed to help... Not with UPS!"
Absolutely the worst courier service around. Parcel was delivered by UPS to the wrong address and the tracking shows it was signed for by a person called Louise. Having contacted UPS a number of times about this (on the same day it was incorrectly delivered) the depot and the driver do not remember where he left it. It’s now down to me to chase the shipper to make a claim. UPS are not interested in resolving this at all. I will never purchase from a company if it shows they use UPS. One star is one too many.
"Absolute disaster! I posted a return to US from UK and was hoping that UPS will do good job. I could not be more wrong! My parcel was stuck at the airport for over a month, I wasted significant amount of time trying to sort it out. Initially, I was being told that my parcel is delayed because of general delays at the customs. After few more phone calls and my parcel still being stuck at the airport, I was told that my parcel is delayed because some documentation is missing (it was not) and that I will be contacted by email to provide it. I did receive an email, later that I was told I would, asking me to provide ""commercial invoice"", to which I explained that I do not sell anything (parcel was a return) and, as I already told UPS on every single occasion I called them, I filled in required customs forms. I never received a reply, never added any new documentation, however, at this stage the tracking information changed and said that ""UPS has received the information needed to submit your parcel for clearance."" They never received any new information, because there was no need for it in first instance! Prior to that, there were few entries in tracking information saying that ""UPS initiated contact with the sender to obtain clearance information"". Needles to say, nobody ever contacted me and every time I called them, I was told some utter nonsense. A month later, my parcel still has not been delivered. Even one star is too many."
"I was getting a repaired unit back from company.. it had to be signed for.. I have a gate with a code to my property.. UPS left message I was not home but I was, I called left gate code for them, next day another note I was note home, called UPS again they said I never called and left gate code, left it again said delivery office would call me they never did. Next day left note saying last try delivery and I was not home, again I was.. called UPS office they said they would have delivery office call me again never did.. package is god knows were.and I am out of my returned fixed drone.. never use UPS if you want good service.."
"WORST SERVICE EVER.
They have lost two of my packages which I shipped during my move from New York to Texas about six months ago. The driver came to our place and confirmed he delivered the package to a different location. There was about a 50Pound box each of all of our memories. I was with them countless times over the phone and the customer service people are very rude.Both my packages were insured. After six months they paid only for one. It's very hard to go to talk to them over the phone also. If you have the option don't use them at all."
"They did not call before they were going to make the delivery which is very unusual in my country as every other delivery service calls if the person is at home before the delivery. So I wasn’t at home when the delivery guy was at my place and I got a text to call the UPS ASAP. I called and on the other end of the phone was a very annoyed and rude woman who was angry at me that I wasn’t home, I said how was I supposed to know to be home and why didn’t you call me beforehand. She said that UPS does NOT have to call and if I wanted a phone call then I should have stated that before. But how?!? I did not send the package to me, the store that I ordered from sent the package. And how should I know that if all the other devices call automatically whiteout any special action.
Then the woman said that anyways they tried to call when they were at the door but it was the wrong number. She said that like it was my fault somehow.. I asked then how did you know what number to send the text and she uttered something with such an annoyance that I didn’t even understand her. Her point was that everything is my fault anyways.
Worst delivery service at my country."
"I use the UPS store #1362 frequently for overnighting documents for our customers. (20+ times in 7 months.) It is imperative that these deliveries are timely. The manager of the store- Sue Droscha, is excellent as is Quandra S. and Trae J. They are fast, helpful and courteous. Recently, a customer needed documents sent to Russia. Their was an issue with the translation of the address on our end, and delivery was held up. Sue contacted me on the weekend to let me know, and I was able to reach my customer by phone to get a corrected address. She in turn was able to reach out proactively to her customers in Russia, which solidified her trust in us. Thank you Sue and staff!"
"The delivery is horrible, where it takes them so long to deliver. Plus, I had to pay an additional fee because the workers made a mistake and I had to pay for it. Either they're hiring dumb workers or they're hiring dumb, stupid workers. SMFH."
"The worst shipping and customer service you'll ever get. Literally, from bottom to top, every person you speak to is worse than the one before."
Awful service!!!! Can't ever speak to someone. I placed an order on the 9th... said it would be delivered by the 17th. It's the 22nd and still don't have it and there are no updates as to when it will arrive. I've always hated finding out my companies I love to order from uses them!! So annoyed!
"I don't even want to give them the one star that you are forced to give.
Cannot be constructive - UPS is Useless, Pathetic and Stupid.
Will never use this company again."
"The most pathetic service What you can ever imagine off !

First and last time using this service ! Wasted my day waiting for the delivery and customer service was even more sh**er"
"Ups charges for express delivery in 4 days and 4 days later the parcel is still in ups depot. When I contacted customer service after 2 hour of waiting in the phone, I was lied to that the parcel was in customs"
No item. No refund. Want me to follow an impossible process to get my money back. No one in the business seems to be able to tell me how to use THEIR claims system. Totally infuriating and the business should be closed.
"I used UPS to send a parcel from Italy to the UK. UPS took my money, collected the parcel, then a few days later, on the day the parcel was supposed to arrive in the UK, it was sent back to the sending address. I tried to get my money back. They refunded me, then a few days later, THEY TOOK THE MONEY BACK OUT OF MY ACCOUNT! I'm pretty certain this isn't legal. I had to cancel my card and get a refund from my bank! Don't use UPS for sending parcels abroad!"
"Probably the worst shipping company, lost my $1200 bc coilover and gave me 200 back, my package was suppose to come and the delivery date changed 3 times already , it was suppose to come yesterday and it says receiver wasn’t available, I’ve been home all day and have cameras all around my house , no one ever came"
"All good, two rugs delivered with flying colours. Initial confirmation, tracking, clear process to alter the delivery date without extra costs, all worked well. The before noon delivery suited to our plans well. Thanks for excellent service."
"They are the worst. I hate when i have a scheduled delivery time, you see it is not to far away and then all of a sudden, its not delivered and you see a message that says delivery date will be provided as soon as possible. I find that my package is lost when that happens, because it happens often and the package never arrives. You cant speak to anyone, all you do is get messages. UPS is the worst. I would give 0 stars if i could."
"UPS needs to be taken down, a year ago I ordered a Processor and it disappeared between UPS and USPS. Now my friends $3800 custom PC he ordered disappeared before it got to his state"
I wrote on the box fragile and the box was in so bad condition. They are the worst employees and is very sad.
"I called the tech support line (1-800-742-5877) and received the callback from a different department.

They said they would transfer me to tech support, and put me on a ""dead line"" that rang twice and then went silent. This is very poor customer service."
"Ups driver clueless where he was, I honked at him where he motioned with hand like a gun to shoot me! He then patted his waistband where you could see a pistol. Called customer service and they didn't care!"
