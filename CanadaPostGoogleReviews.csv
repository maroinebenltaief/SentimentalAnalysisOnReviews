My last visit I was mailing an international package and wanted to use stamps, because the recipient collects stamps and would appreciate old fashioned stamps over a price label. I asked for large denomination international stamps and the lady said Canada Post didn’t have any, that they don’t sell them anymore. She gave me over 20 P stamps to put on a small packet...When I asked for US stamps, because they’re higher value than P stamps, thinking I’d have to use less of those, she seemed to get a bit overwhelmed and stressed, like she didn’t quite know what she was doing, and just said “no.”. I’ve tried to buy stamps from here before and they never have a good stock of stamps, certainly no international stamps. It’s a poorly staffed and stocked location. I go there because it’s close to where I live but think I will be walking out of my way to find better service."
